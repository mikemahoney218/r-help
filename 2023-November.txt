The error I got was:

Error in UseMethod("predict") : 
  no applicable method for 'predict' applied to an object of class "c('matrix', 'array', 'double', 'numeric')"


I'm not sure why the name of the object was cv_model since it was not created as a cross-validation result.

The loops called predict() twice and it was the second call that produced the error since the predictLasso object was not a glmnet classed object.

If the OP had left out the second use of predict and then subtracted predictLasso from the y vector a result would have appeared

y=T[-sam,]$y
MSE = mean((y-predictLasso)^2)
...
> mean(unlist(lst))
[1] 23.39621

Whether this is meaningful is hard to tell. It also makes the fundamental error of overwriting the original data object `y` with another intermediate result.

Hello all,

I would like to take down my packages posted/created on the website rdrr.io.
[https://rdrr.io/] Is there any way to take down packages from the website?
It would be appreciated if you suggested/offered a way to remove the
package from the website.

Thank you.

I think it's unlikely to find people affiliated with rdrr.io here on
the R-help mailing list. Have you tried contacting the website author
via the links at the bottom of the page? They reference both the
author's e-mail address and the dedicated GitHub issue repo.

   There is a github site with an issues list: 
https://github.com/rdrr-io/rdrr-issues/issues

   It looks like people have successfully requested removal in the past, 
e.g. https://github.com/rdrr-io/rdrr-issues/issues/113

The website you are concerned about is not maintained by the R-project. A but of link-following suggested to me that the person you need to be addressing this to has a "personal" webpage at:  https://ianhowson.com/

There will be many other sites that hold most or all of the extensive list of CRAN packages, although it is certainly true that rrio.io has become a favorite of Google.
