Subject: [R] 2 bands (confidence and prediction) on the same GAM plot?

Dear R-experts,

Here below my R code (toy example) working! The only thing missing is in my GAM plot: I would like to get on the same graph the 2 bands (prediction and confidence bands) like in my lm model graph!
Is it possible? How to get that?

Dear All,

I have a dataset which contains date and 12 other countries data. I
have extracted the data as xts object.

I am not able to recall all the series in the Y axis. My data set
looks like this

My code for the same is as follows

ggplot(data=data_vol3, aes(x=index, y=data_vol3$usa)+
  geom_line())

Any help in this regard will be highly appreciated

Well you don't need to say that the y data are from data_vol3, your data 
= declaration says that.

I wonder if what you want is:

library(tidyverse)

tribble(
 ? ~rowN, ~index, ~crepub, ~finland, ~france, ~germany, ~italy, 
~netherlands, ~norway, ~poland,
 ? 1, "2005-01-03", 1.21, 0.615, 1.90, 3.01, 0.346, 0.509, 1.05, 1.13,
 ? 2, "2005-01-04", 1.18, 0.615, 1.85, 2.89, 0.346, 0.509, 0.889, 1.12,
 ? 3, "2005-01-05", 1.15, 0.615, 1.81, 2.78, 0.346, 0.509, 0.785, 1.09,
 ? 4, "2005-01-06", 1.11, 0.615, 1.76, 2.67, 0.346, 0.509, 0.711, 1.06,
 ? 5, "2005-01-07", 1.08, 0.615, 1.72, 2.57, 0.346, 0.509, 0.661, 1.02,
 ? 6, "2005-01-10", 1.04, 0.615, 1.69, 2.48, 0.346, 0.509, 0.630, 1.01) 
-> data_vol3

### please give us data using dput in future: saves us having to do 
something like that to reclaim it!

### pivot that longer to make it easy to get country data as separate lines

data_vol3 %>%? select(-rowN) %>%
 ? pivot_longer(cols = -index, # as you want to pivot the other 
variables/columns
 ?????????????? names_to = "countries") -> tibDataVol3Long

ggplot(data = tibDataVol3Long,
 ?????? aes(x = index, y = value,
 ???????????? ### now get the grouping and use it for a colour legend
 ???????????? group = countries, colour = countries)) +
 ? geom_line()

Dear Upananda,

to complement the current response to your question, your data
source looks like a "wide table" while you would certainly need them to
be organised as a "long table", or to speak differently as a "tidy
table". You should read this source in order to get a grasp on these
issues:

https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html

Please note that the etiquette on this list states that example data
should conform to some constraints that your message does not conform
to (you shoud therefore also read the posting guide:
http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html).

Yours. 
Olivier.

Reorganize the data so that you have three columns
Something more like this:

Date                      Country      Value
2005-01-03          Crepub        1.21

You ggplot statement has a mistake. The geom_line() should be outside the ggplot() call.

You might then have a ggplot statement like
ggplot(data=data_vol3, aes(x=Country, y=Value)) + geom_line()

Just make sure that the data type(s) are what they need to be. Country is non-numeric, and I am not sure geom_line() will like that. I am not sure why one might draw a line connecting categorical items.

ggplot(data=data_vol3, aes(x=index, y=data_vol3$usa)+
  geom_line())

Any help in this regard will be highly appreciated

With regards,
Upananda Pani

Hi Chris,

Thank for your solutions and time. I am getting the following error
while trying to execute the code you suggested.

Error in select(., -rowN) : unused argument (-rowN)

Upananda

Hi Chrish,

I am grateful to you for your reply. Your code is working fine.
Moreover, you have guided me how to improve my knowledge, I appreciate
it. I will be very careful next time.
The data which i am working on is given below:

dput(head(data_vol3))
structure(list(index = structure(c(12786, 12787, 12788, 12789,
12790, 12793), tzone = "UTC", tclass = "Date", class = "Date"),

    ), norway = c(1.052509528, 0.889357215, 0.784607722, 0.710551664,

    ), slovenia = c(0.831886154, 0.831945994, 0.832003445, 0.832058602,
    0.832111556, 0.832162397), uk = c(1.504813191, 1.463648326,

    )), row.names = c(NA, -6L), class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"
))

As there are some countries which are having higher volatilities than
countries with lower, is there any suggestion to improve the graph?

Looking forward to your suggestion in this regard.

With sincere regards,
Upananda Pani

I know it doesn't feel a very sympathetic piece of advice, but I think you need to spend some days working on your understanding of R, ggplot and the tidyverse realm of R.  You can use ggplot() without using much of the tidyverse but they are designed to complement each other and the more I understand of the tidyverse way of doing things, the better I use ggplot().

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] gsDesign2 1.0.8 is released
Message-ID: <8e6617ab-a4aa-4a9c-927d-133e0cd846e5@app.fastmail.com>

Dear all,

A new version of gsDesign2 (1.0.8) is now on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=gsDesign2). gsDesign2 enables fixed or group sequential design under non-proportional hazards and supports highly flexible enrollment, time-to-event, and time-to-dropout assumptions.

The key improvements in this version include refined naming conventions for options in the info_scale argument adhering to the tidyverse design guide, and bug fixes for computing the futility bounds. Please see the changelog (https://merck.github.io/gsDesign2/news/) for details.

As the gsDesign2 package is still in its early stages, we're eager to continue refining its features and performance. We invite you to try out this new version and share your insights with us. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us develop a tool that meets the evolving needs of users.

Cheers,
-Nan

Dear Upananda,

I see a misplaced bracket in your code, and there is no need in aes() to call the dataframe explicitly. Does this work?

ggplot(data = data_vol3, aes(x = index, y = usa)) +
  geom_line()

Best wishes,
Thomas

Betreff: [R] Reg: Help regarding ggplot2

Dear All,

I have a dataset which contains date and 12 other countries data. I
have extracted the data as xts object.

I am not able to recall all the series in the Y axis. My data set
looks like this

index      crepub finland france germany italy netherlands norway poland
  <date>      <dbl>   <dbl>  <dbl>   <dbl> <dbl>       <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>

2 2005-01-04   1.18   0.615   1.85    2.89 0.346       0.509  0.889   1.12
3 2005-01-05   1.15   0.615   1.81    2.78 0.346       0.509  0.785   1.09

5 2005-01-07   1.08   0.615   1.72    2.57 0.346       0.509  0.661   1.02
6 2005-01-10   1.04   0.615   1.69    2.48 0.346       0.509  0.630   1.01

My code for the same is as follows

ggplot(data=data_vol3, aes(x=index, y=data_vol3$usa)+
  geom_line())

Any help in this regard will be highly appreciated

With regards,
Upananda Pani

I'm only seeing six dates, by the look of them five at one day intervals 
and the last three days later.? According to my calendar those were 
weekdays in 2005.? I don't see much "volatility" there and that's not a 
term I'm familiar with, I suspect it's econometric.? I don't know what 
you're looking for and I think we're starting to get into issues about 
interpretation of data not issues about using R so off list.? I think 
you need statistical or econometric support from somewhere.

Good luck!

Chris

I know it doesn't feel a very sympathetic piece of advice, but I think you need to spend some days working on your understanding of R, ggplot and the tidyverse realm of R.  You can use ggplot() without using much of the tidyverse but they are designed to complement each other and the more I understand of the tidyverse way of doing things, the better I use ggplot().

Dear all,?
I am trying to plot the following table in stacked barplot in percentages and also horizontal.
Component? ? ? Sample 1? ? ? Sample 2? ? ?

When I tried the following functionbarplot(data,

+         sub = "Subtitle",
+         xlab = "X-lab",
+         ylab = "Y-lab",
+         axes = TRUE, horiz = TRUE)
I got the following error
Error in barplot.default(hellisheidi, main = "Stacked bar chart", sub = "Subtitle",  : 
  'height' must be a vector or a matrix
I also tried barplot(as.matrix(hellisheidi)) but what I was getting was the three stacked columns for Samples 1, 2 and 3 but I was getting an empty column for Component, instead of being the variable in the Samples. 


I was hoping if you could help me on that. 
Thank you very much in advance. 
Kind regards,Maria

Dear Richard,?

Thank you very much for your reply. I went through the code and it worked. I was also able to change the colours.?

I was wondering if I can change the legend position; instead of being in the bottom to be on the left side.?

I tried the following but without any success

strip = FALSE
strip.right = TRUE

likert(t(hellisheidi), ReferenceZero=.5, xlab="X-lab", ylab="Y-lab", main="Stacked bar chart", col=c("#E94E1B", "#F7AA4E", "#BEBEBE", "#6193CE", "#00508C", "#E94E1B", "#BEBEBE"), legend.position="left")

Once again, thank you very much.

Kind regards,
Maria

likert is built on the lattice barchart function.
Hence everything in
?panel.barchart
?xyplot
applies.  The legend is constructed with the auto.key argument.

You can move the legend to the left, but that is not a good idea for a horizontal barchart.

likert(t(hellisheidi), ReferenceZero=.5,
        xlab="X-lab", ylab="Y-lab", main="stacked bar chart",
        auto.key=list(space="left", columns=1))

Note that the legend is vertical and the plot is horizontal, making it difficult
to read both simultaneously.

Subject: [R] Question about implementing statistical test in R
Message-ID: <CAJXJZ4Z6n575vkxymNBWvdVNfrGb=i7jfJ2aWDp9=6d2YFQn1g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am a new user and have a stats question that I need help implementing in
R.

I have 4 groups and I want to assess whether there is a statistical
difference between these groups at baseline first in a global comparison
test and then a pairwise comparison test.

There are about 2 continuous variables and 10 categorical variables

For the group wise comparison for continuous variables-I am using the Mann
Whitney test

For the categorical variables-I am using either chi square or Fisher
exact test for both global comparison and pairwise comparison.

What packages should I use to implement this in R? Is there any example
code that I use? I was thinking tbl_summary but don't think that's the
right one.

Would really appreciate any help with this!

Thank you!

Start with defining your dependent variable and independent variable(s). As an equation like y equals some function of x, the y is the dependent variable. It is often continuous, but does not have to be.

If your continuous variable is the dependent variable and you have one categorical independent variable then the ANOVA would be a general comparison tests determining if there are differences. This can be further broken down by a multiple comparison test. The Tukey test is commonly used if you assume normal distributions. The Kruskal-Wallis test would be the start of a non-parametric approach.

Subject: [R] question about update()
Message-ID: <545716BA-05C4-4C53-92BC-40B23555AF69@stat.unipd.it>

Hi. There must be something about the use of update() which I do not grasp,
as the next exercise indicates.

Suppose that obj is an object returned by a call to lm() or glm().
Next, a new variable xf is constructed using the same dataframe used 
for producing obj. Then

obj$data <- cbind(obj$data, xf=xf)
new.obj <- update(obj, . ~ . + xf) 

generates

Error in eval(predvars, data, env) : object 'xf' not found

Could somebody explain what I got wrong, and how to fix it?

Best regards,

Adelchi Azzalini

Thanks, Duncan. What you indicate is surely the ideal route. Unfortunately, in my case this is not feasible, because the construction of xf and the update call are within an iterative procedure where xf is changed at each iteration, so that the steps 

obj$data <- cbind(obj$data, xf=xf)
new.obj <- update(obj, . ~ . + xf)
 
must be repeated hundreds of times, each with a different xf.

Sorry, that doesn't make sense.

You didn't show us complete code, but presumably it's preceded by 
something like this:

   obj <- glm( ..., data = somedata)

So change your modification to this:

   somedata$xf <- xf

That can be done hundreds of times.  This will need to be more elaborate 
if the function doing the iteration has a copy of obj but doesn't have a 
copy of somedata, but there are lots of ways to resolve that.  Without 
seeing complete code, I can't recommend which one to use.

If memory serves correctly, update() takes the object that is passed to
it, looks at what the call was that created that object, modifies that
call according to the additional arguments, and finally executes the
modified call.

So there is a lot of manipulations going on in update().  In particular
it would result each time in a call to lm(), glm() or whatever call was
used to create the object.  Inside any of these modelling functions a
lot of symbolic manipulations/calculations are needed too (parsing the
formula, creating the design matrix and response vector from the parsed
formula and data frame, checking if weights are used &c).

If you do the same calculation essentially over and over again, just
with minor modification, all these symbolic manipulations are just time
consuming.

IMHO, you will be better off to bypass update() and just use lm.fit()
(for which lm() is a nice front-end) and glm.fit() (for which glm() is a
nice front-end), or whatever routine does the grunt work of fitting the
model to the data in your application (hopefully, the package creator
used a set up of XXX.fit() to fit the model, called by XXX() that does
all the fancy formula handling).

Cheers,

	Berwin

Hi, Berwin, good to hear from you, and thanks for the detailed comments and suggestion.

Actually, my current experimental code works in the way that you suggest, calling directly lm.fit and glm.fit.  What I am trying to develop is an ?improved? version of the code for distribution to other people. Hence I wanted to streamline the code, in particular avoiding branches for each fitting procedure (lm.fit, glm.fit and possibly more).  But I am now considering to drop the idea of the ?improved? version, and stick to the direct calls to the fitting functions.

Duncan, thanks for your additional comments. It is true that my original message presented a very simplified picture of the problem, possibly over-simplistic.  If I present the problem in the full version of the code, it would look quite long and messy. If I manage to construct a reasonably simplified version of the code, I shall post the question again.

Best wishes,

Adelchi

Subject: [R] Regex Split?
Message-ID: <7b1cdbe7-0086-24b4-9da6-369296eadfdc@syonic.eu>

Dear R-Users,

I tried the following 3 Regex expressions in R 4.3:
strsplit("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", " |(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])", perl=T)
# "a"??? "bc"?? ","??? "def"? ","??? ""???? "adef" ","??? "," "gh"

strsplit("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", " |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])", perl=T)
# "a"??? "bc"?? ","??? "def"? ","??? ""???? "adef" ","??? "," "gh"

strsplit("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", " |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?=[^ ])", perl=T)
# "a"??? "bc"?? ","??? "def"? ","??? ""???? "adef" ","??? "," "gh"


Is this correct?


I feel that:
- none should return (after "def"): ",", "";
- the first one could also return "", "," (but probably not; not fully 
sure about this);


Sincerely,


Leonard

Message-ID: <dedac47f-7bcf-ca27-4df6-1ee7027aa10d@yandex.com>

Hi

I can't get rgl working. I installed rgl, loaded it, but it seems all 
plot3d codes have failed:

remotes::install_github("dmurdoch/rgl")
library(rgl)
open3d()
x <- sort(rnorm(1000))
y <- rnorm(1000)
z <- rnorm(1000) + atan2(x, y)
plot3d(x, y, z, col = rainbow(1000))

I see no plotting at all. Am I missing some important system library or 
whatever? I'm using Linux Mint 23. Thanks!

Thanks,
Jiayue

If you install the version from CRAN, do you get the same results?

rgl needs X11 on your system.  Do other programs using it work, e.g. try 
running "glxgears" at the terminal, and try running 
"tcltk::tktoplevel()" in R.

BTW, this list isn't for contributed package support, so if it turns out 
that only rgl is failing, it may be best to move the discussion to 
https://github.com/dmurdoch/rgl/issues .

Perl seems to return the results you expect:

$ perl -E '
 say("$_:\n ", join " ", map qq["$_"], split $_, q[a bc,def, adef ,,gh])
 for (
  qr[ |(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])],
  qr[ |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])],
  qr[ |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?=[^ ])]
)'
(?^u: |(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])):
 "a" "bc" "," "def" "," "adef" "," "," "gh"
(?^u: |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])):
 "a" "bc" "," "def" "," "adef" "," "," "gh"
(?^u: |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?=[^ ])):
 "a" "bc" "," "def" "," "adef" "," "," "gh"

The same thing happens when I ask R to replace the separators instead
of splitting by them:

sapply(setNames(nm = c(
 " |(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])",
 " |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])",
 " |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?=[^ ])")
), gsub, '[]', "a bc,def, adef ,,gh", perl = TRUE)
#               |(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])         |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ]) 
# "a[]bc[],[]def[],[]adef[],[],[]gh" "a[]bc[],[]def[],[]adef[],[],[]gh" 
#        |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?=[^ ]) 
# "a[]bc[],[]def[],[]adef[],[],[]gh" 

I think that something strange happens when the delimeter pattern
matches more than once in the same place:

gsub(
 '(?=<--)|(?<=-->)', '[]', 'split here --><-- split here',
 perl = TRUE
)
# [1] "split here -->[]<-- split here"

(Both Perl's split() and s///g agree with R's gsub() here, although I
would have accepted "split here -->[][]<-- split here" too.)

On the other hand, the following doesn't look right:

strsplit(
 'split here --><-- split here', '(?=<--)|(?<=-->)',
 perl = TRUE
)
# [[1]]
# [1] "split here -->" "<"              "-- split here"

The "<" is definitely not followed by "<--", and the rightmost "--" is
definitely not preceded by "-->".

Perhaps strsplit() incorrectly advances the match position after one
match?

If you only want the character strings, this seems a little simpler:

[[1]]
[1] "a"    "bc"   "def"  "adef" "gh"  


If you need delimeters (the commas) you could then add them back in again afterwards.

But no window opens for tcltk::tktoplevel()?  Sounds like R isn't seeing 
your DISPLAY variable.  Does Sys.getenv("DISPLAY") show the same thing 
in R as you see when printing that environment variable (using e.g. 
`echo $DISPLAY`) in the terminal?

Oh yes, a window did open for tcltk::tktoplevel(), I forgot to mention 
it, sorry.
With Sys.getenv("DISPLAY"), I got

In that case, it sounds like it's purely an rgl issue, but I don't 
really have anything else to suggest about how to fix it.  There is a 
workaround:  Run the `rglwidget()` function whenever you want to see a 
plot, and it should open in your browser.

https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16745 (from 2016, still labelled
'UNCONFIRMED") contains some other examples of strsplit misbehaving when
using 0-length perl look-behinds.  E.g.,

> strsplit(split="[[:<:]]", "One, two; three!", perl=TRUE)[[1]]
 [1] "O"  "n"  "e"  ", " "t"  "w"  "o"  "; " "t"  "h"  "r"  "e"  "e"  "!"
> gsub(pattern="[[:<:]]", "#", "One, two; three!", perl=TRUE)
[1] "#One, #two; #three!"

The bug report includes the comment

It may be possible that strsplit is not using the startoffset argument
to pcre_exec

  pcre/pcre/doc/html/pcreapi.html
    A non-zero starting offset is useful when searching for another match
    in the same subject by calling pcre_exec() again after a previous
    success. Setting startoffset differs from just passing over a
    shortened string and setting PCRE_NOTBOL in the case of a pattern that
    begins with any kind of lookbehind.

or it could be something else.

Thank you, Bill -- yes, uhmm, ... a bit embarrassing.

I've finally changed the R bugzilla report's state to "CONFIRMED" now,
and also added the "HELPWANTED" keyword.
I think we (R Core) should be sorry to have (forgotten / not
cared about) the issue completely.

It's not hard to at least agree that the current behavior is buggy,
e.g., in the example you show here :

    >> strsplit(split="[[:<:]]", "One, two; three!", perl=TRUE)[[1]]
    > [1] "O"  "n"  "e"  ", " "t"  "w"  "o"  "; " "t"  "h"  "r"  "e"  "e"  "!"
    >> gsub(pattern="[[:<:]]", "#", "One, two; three!", perl=TRUE)
    > [1] "#One, #two; #three!"

[...]
[...]

Maybe this should be continued either on Bugzilla (i.e., the URL above),
or if needed, additionally  on R-devel.

Yes, I also added that we'd grateful for (tested) patches and/or
code reviewers.

Martin

Dear Bill,


Indeed, there are other cases as well - as documented.


Various Regex sites give the warning to avoid the legacy syntax 
"[[:<:]]", so this is the alternative syntax:
strsplit(split="\\b(?=\\w)", "One, two; three!", perl=TRUE)
# "O"? "n"? "e"? ", " "t"? "w"? "o"? "; " "t"? "h"? "r"? "e"? "e" "!"

gsub("\\b(?=\\w)", "#", "One, two; three!", perl=TRUE)
# "#One, #two; #three!"


Sincerely,


Leonard

Leonard,

It can be helpful to spell out your intent in English or some of us have to go back to the documentation to remember what some of the operators do.

Your text being searched seems to be an example of items between comas with an optional space after some commas and in one case, nothing between commas.

So what is your goal for the example, and in general? You mention a bit unclearly at the end some of what you expect and I think it would be clearer if you also showed exactly the output you would want.

I saw some other replies that addressed what you wanted and am going to reply in another direction.

Why do things the hard way using things like lookahead or look behind? Would several steps get you the result way more clearly?

For the sake of argument, you either want what reading in a CSV file would supply, or something else. Since you are not simply splitting on commas, it sounds like something else. But what exactly else? Something as simple as this on just a comma produces results including empty strings and embedded leading or trailing spaces:

strsplit("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", ",")
[[1]]
[1] "a bc"   "def"    " adef " ""       "gh"  

That can of course be handled by, for example, trimming the result after unlisting the odd way strsplit returns results:

library("stringr") 
str_squish(unlist(strsplit("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", ",")))

[1] "a bc" "def"  "adef" ""     "gh"  

Now do you want the empty string to be something else, such as an NA? That can be done too with another step.

And a completely different variant can be used to read in your one-line CSV as text using standard overkill tools:

> read.table(text="a bc,def, adef ,,gh", sep=",")
    V1  V2     V3 V4 V5
1 a bc def  adef  NA gh

The above is a vector of texts. But if you simply want to reassemble your initial string cleaned up a bit, you can use paste to put back commas, as in a variation of the earlier example:

> paste(str_squish(unlist(strsplit("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", ","))), collapse=",")
[1] "a bc,def,adef,,gh"

So my question is whether using advanced methods is really necessary for your case, or even particularly efficient. If efficiency matters, often, it is better to use tools without regular expressions such as paste0() when they meet your needs.

Of course, unless I know what you are actually trying to do, my remarks may be not useful.

I tried the following 3 Regex expressions in R 4.3:
strsplit("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", " |(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])", perl=T)
# "a"    "bc"   ","    "def"  ","    ""     "adef" ","    "," "gh"

strsplit("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", " |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])", perl=T)
# "a"    "bc"   ","    "def"  ","    ""     "adef" ","    "," "gh"

strsplit("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", " |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?=[^ ])", perl=T)
# "a"    "bc"   ","    "def"  ","    ""     "adef" ","    "," "gh"


Is this correct?


I feel that:
- none should return (after "def"): ",", "";
- the first one could also return "", "," (but probably not; not fully 
sure about this);


Sincerely,


Leonard

Dear Avi,

Punctuation marks are used in various NLP language models. Preserving 
the "," is therefore useful in such scenarios and Regex are useful to 
accomplish this (especially if you have sufficient experience with such 
expressions).

I observed only an odd behaviour using strsplit: the example string is 
constructed; but it is always wise to test a Regex expression against 
various scenarios. It is usually hard to predict what special cases will 
occur in a specific corpus.

strsplit("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", " |(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])", perl=T)
# "a"? "bc"? ","? "def"? ","? ""? "adef"? ","? ","? "gh"

stringi::stri_split("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", regex=" |(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])")
# "a"??? "bc"?? ","??? "def"? ","??? "adef"? ""???? ","??? "," "gh"

stringi::stri_split("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", regex=" |(?<! 
)(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])")
# "a"??? "bc"?? ","??? "def"? ","??? "adef"? ","??? ","??? "gh"

# Expected:
# "a"? "bc" ? ","? "def" ? ","? "adef"? "," ? ","? "gh"
# see 2nd instance of stringi::stri_split


Sincerely,


Leonard

Primarily for my own amusement, here is a way to do what I think you wanted
without look-aheads/behinds

strsplit(gsub("([[:punct:]])"," \\1 ","a bc,def, adef,x; ,,gh"), " +")
[[1]]
 [1] "a"    "bc"   ","    "def"  ","    "adef" ","    "x"    ";"
[10] ","    ","    "gh"

I certainly would *not* claim that it is in any way superior to anything
that has already been suggested -- indeed, probably the contrary. But it's
simple (as am I).

Cheers,
Bert

Dear Bert,

Thank you for the suggestion. Indeed, there are various solutions and 
workarounds. However, there is still a bug in strsplit.

2.) gsub
I would try to avoid gsub on a Wikipedia-sized corpus: using strsplit 
directly should be far more efficient.

3.) Punctuation marks
Abbreviations and "word1-word2" may be a problem:
gsub("(?<ThePunct>[[:punct:]])", "\\1 ", "A.B.C.", perl=T)
# "A. B. C. "

I do not yet have an intuition if the spaces in "A. B. C. " would 
adversely affect the language model. But this goes off-topic.

Sincerely,

Leonard

Subject: [R] Huge differences in Ram Consumption with different versions of
 R on the same scripts
Message-ID: <CAKBFG3Zr5kgb9cTu45PHU=a4rb78upxZPjpQjGoU+PnSwfZBQg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello R Help,

I have some R vignettes that run fpp2 time series regressions.  I have run
these for a long time using R and a 12 core computer system.  I ran each
core using Linux to run a vignette on that core, so that all 12 could work
concurrently.  With 48GB of ram, the ram never filled up. I ran these
regressions for hours, one data set right after the other on each core.
Recently, I switched to Oracle Linux 8 and R 4.2 Now, with the same
scripts, and the same data, the ram fills up and R reserves 4.2GB per
instance in some cases.  This results in all the ram being consumed and the
swap space on the system activating constantly so that the performance is
abysmal. It begins using 12Gb of swap space in addition to the ram
consumed.  It bogs the system so bad that one can't even establish new
terminal sessions.

Is there a way to specify a maximum ram allowance in an R vignette?  If
that?s not possible, what resources can you recommend to help identify the
reason for the change in memory use?  Why would a different version of
R/Linux use 2GB per instance, while another uses 4.4GB? What kind of
troubleshooting or programming techniques should I research for this kind
of concern?

Assuming the vignettes are the same in both cases, try going back to
the system where it worked and introduce a single change? i.e.
a) previous linux system and R 4.2
b) Previous R version and Oracle Linux 8

Repeat the test for a) and b) and if one works fine and the other
fails at least that will narrow down the search.

Eric

Hi,
One problem you have is with the command:
regr<-randomForest(y~x1+x2, data=X_train, proximity=TRUE)

What you need is something like this:

X2 <- cbind(X,y)
regr<-randomForest(y~x1+x2, data=X2, proximity=TRUE)

HTH,
Eric

Subject: [R] data.frame with a column containing an array
Message-ID: <trinity-2eda1037-de24-4b26-849a-41f0a1104f03-1683543179774@3c-app-gmx-bap03>

Dear list members,

when I create a data.frame containing an array I had expected, that I get a similar result, when subsetting it, like having a matrix in a data.frame. But instead I get only the first element and not all values of the remaining dimensions. Differences are already when creating the data.frame, where I can use `I` in case of a matrix but for an array I am only able to insert it in a second step.

DFA <- data.frame(id = 1:2)
DFA[["ar"]] <- array(1:8, c(2,2,2))

DFA[1,]
#  id ar
#1  1  1

DFM <- data.frame(id = 1:2, M = I(matrix(1:4, 2)))

DFM[1,]
#  id M.1 M.2
#1  1   1   3

The same when trying to use merge, where only the first value is kept.

merge(DFA, data.frame(id = 1))
#  id ar
#1  1  1

merge(DFM, data.frame(id = 1))
#  id M.1 M.2
#1  1   1   3

Is there a way to use an array in a data.frame like I can use a matrix in a data.frame?

I am using R version 4.3.0.

Kind regards,
Georg

Hello,

Are you looking for something like this?


DFA <- data.frame(id = 1:2)
DFA[["ar"]] <- array(1:8, c(2,2,2))

DFA$ar[1, , ]
#>      [,1] [,2]
#> [1,]    1    5
#> [2,]    3    7


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Hi Sacha,
On second thought, perhaps this is more the direction that you want ...

X2 = cbind(X_train,y_train)
colnames(X2)[3] = "y"
regr2<-randomForest(y~x1+x2, data=X2,maxnodes=10, ntree=10)
regr
regr2

#Make prediction
predictions= predict(regr, X_test)
predictions2= predict(regr2, X_test)

HTH,
Eric

Thanks!

No, to be consistent with what I get with a matrix I think it should be like:

x <- data.frame(id = DFA$id[1])
x$ar <- DFA$ar[1, , , drop = FALSE]

str(x)
#'data.frame': 1 obs. of 2 variables:
# $ id: int 1
# $ ar: int [1, 1:2, 1:2] 1 3 5 7

Hello,

Are you looking for something like this?


DFA <- data.frame(id = 1:2)
DFA[["ar"]] <- array(1:8, c(2,2,2))

DFA$ar[1, , ]
#> [,1] [,2]
#> [1,] 1 5
#> [2,] 3 7


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas
?

Subject: [R] win110 + R 4.3.0 dowload only when method = "wininet"
Message-ID: <IA0PR19MB72890261CF953C010DE9E381F5719@IA0PR19MB7289.namprd19.prod.outlook.com>

Dear R-users,

I updated my R. I installed 4.3.0.

I have Windows 10 Pro.

I can only install/update packages/files if I select method wininet.

For example:

> update.packages(ask='graphics',checkBuilt=TRUE)
--- Please select a CRAN mirror for use in this session ---
Warning message:
In download.file(url, destfile = f, quiet = TRUE) :
  the 'wininet' method is deprecated for http:// and https:// URLs

What can i do?

Thanks in advance,

Sebas.

Right ... that's what I thought you meant.

I'm pretty sure -- but not certain -- that columns of matrices are treated
specially by [.data.frame, so that you have to explicitly index a higher
dimensional array, e.g. like this:


subs <- c(1,3)
DFA <- data.frame(id = 1:3)
DFA[["ar"]] <- array(1:12, c(3,2,2))

DFA$ar[match(subs,DFA$id),,]
##yielding:
, , 1

     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    4
[2,]    3    6

, , 2

     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    7   10
[2,]    9   12

You might check, e.g. the "data.table" package, to see if it indexes as you
would like with columns that contain arrays.

Alternatively, and perhaps preferably depending on your use case, you may
wish to create a wholly different data structure or just treat the data
frame as a list from the start. Data frames/matrix-like data structures are
convenient and appropriate a lot of the time, but not always. R, like any
flexible programming language, allows you -- even encourages you -- to
create other data structures that fit your needs.

Cheers,
Bert

DFA <- data.frame(id = 1:3)
ar <- array(1:12, c(3,2,2))

Thanks!
With data.table I'm not able to create it.

DT <- data.table::data.table(id = 1:2)
DT$ar <- array(1:8, c(2,2,2))
#Error in set(x, j = name, value = value) : 
#  Supplied 8 items to be assigned to 2 items of column 'ar'. If you wish to 'recycle' the RHS please use rep() to make this intent clear to readers of your code.

DFA <- data.frame(id = 1:2)
DFA[["ar"]] <- array(1:8, c(2,2,2))
data.table::as.data.table(DFA)
#Error in setDT(ans, key = key) : 
#  All elements in argument 'x' to 'setDT' must be of same length, but the profile of input lengths (length:frequency) is: [0:1, 2:2]
#The first entry with fewer than 2 entries is 3

But with tibble it works as expected.

TI <- tibble::tibble(id = 1:2, ar = array(1:8, c(2,2,2)))
str(TI[1,])
#tibble [1 ? 2] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
# $ id: int 1
# $ ar: int [1, 1:2, 1:2] 1 3 5 7

But it would be nice if something similar would also work with data.frame.

Right ... that's what I thought you meant.
?
I'm pretty sure -- but not certain -- that columns of matrices are treated specially by [.data.frame, so that you have to explicitly index a higher dimensional array, e.g. like this:
?
subs <- c(1,3)
DFA <- data.frame(id = 1:3)
DFA[["ar"]] <- array(1:12, c(3,2,2))

DFA$ar[match(subs,DFA$id),,]
##yielding:
, , 1

? ? ?[,1] [,2]
[1,] ? ?1 ? ?4
[2,] ? ?3 ? ?6

, , 2

? ? ?[,1] [,2]
[1,] ? ?7 ? 10
[2,] ? ?9 ? 12
?
You might check, e.g. the "data.table" package, to see if it indexes as you would like with columns that contain arrays.
?
Alternatively, and perhaps preferably depending on your use case, you may wish to create a wholly different data structure or just treat the data frame as a list from the start. Data frames/matrix-like data structures are convenient and appropriate a lot of the time, but not always. R, like any flexible programming language, allows you -- even encourages you -- to create other data structures that fit your needs.
?
Cheers,
Bert?

What kind of proxy does your system use to access the Internet? It's
unfortunate that the default configuration doesn't work any more, but
perhaps libcurl can be taught to recognise this configuration.

Do you at least know whether it's an HTTP proxy, a SOCKS proxy, or
something completely different? Do you need to authenticate to the
proxy?

> How I can add my proxy and port to my R configuration?

libcurl recognises the "http_proxy" environment variable, which can
include the protocol, the address and the port of the proxy server:
https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY.html

For example, if you have a SOCKS5 hostname-resolving proxy on address
192.2.0.1 and port 1080, you can try calling Sys.setenv('http_proxy' =
'socks5h://192.2.0.1:1080'). For a different example, an HTTP proxy on
198.51.100.2, port 8080 can be set up as Sys.setenv('http_proxy' =
'http://198.51.100.2:8080'). (In both cases, the proxy will be used by
curl for HTTP and HTTPS access, but not, say, FTP or other protocols.
For HTTPS via HTTP proxy, curl will be using the CONNECT verb.)

Detecting the right proxy for a given address (and yes, it's expected
to do that per-address) is hard?. It's been a "nice to have" feature in
curl for years: https://curl.se/docs/todo.html#auto_detect_proxy, so
I'm afraid it won't happen any time soon. It's unfortunate that the
curl back-end will break something that used to work with wininet.

I wonder whether it could make sense to call
WinHttpGetIEProxyConfigForCurrentUser() [*] when setting up connections
on Windows. There's no simple way to deal with the proxy
auto-configuration file [**], but we could at least call
curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_PROXY,
wchar_to_current_locale(proxy_config->lpszProxy)); to make the
transition from wininet to curl slightly less painful. Or would that
break even more installations? This won't help in the more complicated
cases [***], though.

Hi there,

When I run the following code in R 4.3.0 on FreeBSD, I got error.

 > as.POSIXct("1970-01-01 00:00.00 UTC")
Error in as.POSIXlt.character(x, tz, ...) :

The same code could give correct answer in R 4.3.0 on Windows, and R 
4.1.2 on a old CentOS.

 > as.POSIXct("1970-01-01 00:00.00 UTC")
[1] "1970-01-01 CST"

I confirmed that all the 3 OSes give the same time zone:

[1] "Asia/Shanghai"

What's wrong with the R on FreeBSD? Any hint? Thanks in advance.

Do strptime("1970-01-01 00:00.00 UTC", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M", '') and
strptime("1970-01-01 00:00.00 UTC", "%Y-%m-%d", '') both return NA for
you on FreeBSD? If not, can you trace the execution using R's debugger
to see which parts are returned as NA, failing the test in
as.POSIXlt.character?

I think that strptime() should have discarded the trailing parts of the
string and matched at least the beginning (though not the ".00 UTC"
part because it doesn't correspond to the formats tried by strptime()).
Moreover, there shouldn't be significant difference between the
platforms, because R seems to always use an internal implementation of
strptime(). Are you using a multi-byte locale? (What's your
sessionInfo() on both a system where it works and the system where it
fails?)

Good catching, but

In R 4.3.0 on FreeBSD, the same error after changing the period to a colon:
 > as.POSIXct("1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC")
Error in as.POSIXlt.character(x, tz, ...) :
   character string is not in a standard unambiguous format

I copy the code from a web page. It works in R 4.3.0 on Windows and R 
4.1.2 on an old CentOS.

Both codes do not return NA on FreeBSD:

[1] "1970-01-01 CST"

I do not know how to use R's debugger...

The sessionInfo on FreeBSD said:

But on Windows it said:

The origin of this problem is when I try to update rstan package in R 
4.3.0 on FreeBSD. I get the same error as that 
https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/issues/612

However, I did not encounter this problem when using R 4.2.x or 4.1.x on 
FreeBSD.

I must have misread the code of as.POSIXlt.character then.

> I do not know how to use R's debugger...

In short, debugonce(as.POSIXlt.character) will prepare R to start the
debugger once the function is called. The debugger prompt is described
in ?browser; it's mostly like R's prompt (you can call print(variable)
and other, more complicated expressions), but there are special
commands like "n" (next statement), "s" (step inside the function call)
and so on.

Call:

debugonce(as.POSIXlt.character)
as.POSIXct("1970-01-01 00:00.00 UTC")

Use n to step over function calls and s to step inside for loops. See
what's returned by strptime() calls inside this function. It's raising
an exception because all of them contain NAs somewhere; which element is
NA? What are the exact arguments used to call strptime()?

This doesn't seem to be due to differences in locale: both CentOS and
FreeBSD use en_US.UTF-8.

Hi there,

The following codes may cause the problem in R 4.3.0 on FreeBSD in my 
last post: Error in as.POSIXlt.character(x, tz, ...)

 > (d <- strptime("1970-01-01 12:00:00 UTC", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS", tz = ""))

In R 4.3.0 on windows,

 > (d <- strptime("1970-01-01 12:00:00 UTC", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS", tz = ""))
[1] "1970-01-01 12:00:00 CST"

The only difference is the result of is.na().

If Sys.setenv() works for you, you can put the line
http_proxy=http://192.2.0.1:8080/ (or an appropriate equivalent) into
an environment file that R reads when it starts up. Specifically, this
environment file could be named ".Renviron" and placed into your
Documents directory, but there are other options too:
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#What-are-HOME-and-working-directories_003f
(see questions 2.13 and 2.14 for what R considers "the home directory"
and how environment variables can be set).

It could be worth raising a feature request for automatic proxy
detection on Windows when libcurl download method is used, though I
don't know whether it would be practical to implement it.

Glad to see you're making progress! (Sometimes, is.na(strptime(...)) ==
TRUE is what progress looks like.)

is.na.POSIXlt works by converting the "unpacked" date+time into POSIXct
(seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC) and then checking whether it's NA.
Evidently, as.POSIXct(d) returns NA. (Right?)

What does unclass(d) look like on FreeBSD? Does it contain any NAs
itself, or do they originate somewhere in as.POSIXct(d)?

My current hypothesis is that FreeBSD mktime() doesn't like something
about the timezone, but I may be wrong. Is is.na(strptime(
"1970-01-03 12:00:00 UTC", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS", tz = '')) also TRUE?

After I post this thread to the mailing list, I dig into 
.Internal(as.POSIXct(d, "")). I think it may be a bug, so I filed a bug 
report on R's bugzilla.

Yes, is.na(strptime("1970-01-03 12:00:00 UTC", "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS", tz 
= '')) also TRUE.

I am not familiar with any system function. I just notice that 
datetime.c in src/main/ of R 4.3.0 increase 500+ more lines compared to 
that of R 4.2.0.

Thank you very much for pointing me to the right direction.

Best,
Jinsong

I can't confirm, that is.na(d) returns TRUE on FreeBSD. On my boxes it 
always gives

I just forgot to answer your question.

unclass(d) has $gmtoff with value of NA. However, in R 4.3.0 on Windows 
this slot also has the value of NA. as.POSIXct(d) on FreeBSD gives NA.

Also note that with R version 4.2.1 and later, there's another change for computers within many corporate firewall systems (that monitor network traffic).  The result is that in the default settings R can't connect out to https connections (and thus can't install or update packages). You just get an error that R can't connect, it may be because of the super-special security in your network.


I don't know if this is your issue, but it seemed worth pointing out if so. (and worth getting the word out there for others...)



Here's the discussion of the bug and the patch.




https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18379




If you are in this situation, the fix is to add a new User Environment Variable:



R_LIBCURL_SSL_REVOKE_BEST_EFFORT and set it to TRUE

Do you at least know whether it's an HTTP proxy, a SOCKS proxy, or
something completely different? Do you need to authenticate to the
proxy?

libcurl recognises the "http_proxy" environment variable, which can
include the protocol, the address and the port of the proxy server:
https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcurl.se%2Flibcurl%2Fc%2FCURLOPT_PROXY.html&data=05%7C01%7Ctim.howard%40dec.ny.gov%7Cba9855f6b8bd4d23531e08db52069dd1%7Cf46cb8ea79004d108ceb80e8c1c81ee7%7C0%7C0%7C638193960595128444%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=UHNtHLqF67%2FGq9%2FILSW6pHmuhhaHsdI1qwl%2FVXun5hI%3D&reserved=0<https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY.html>

For example, if you have a SOCKS5 hostname-resolving proxy on address
192.2.0.1 and port 1080, you can try calling Sys.setenv('http_proxy' =
'socks5h://192.2.0.1:1080'). For a different example, an HTTP proxy on
198.51.100.2, port 8080 can be set up as Sys.setenv('http_proxy' =
'https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2F198.51.100.2%3A8080%2F&data=05%7C01%7Ctim.howard%40dec.ny.gov%7Cba9855f6b8bd4d23531e08db52069dd1%7Cf46cb8ea79004d108ceb80e8c1c81ee7%7C0%7C0%7C638193960595128444%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=K8Lp3oLzHHA9LxIq6U5QrdQvEV63%2BTVOq930i6HABlw%3D&reserved=0<http://198.51.100.2:8080/>'). (In both cases, the proxy will be used by
curl for HTTP and HTTPS access, but not, say, FTP or other protocols.
For HTTPS via HTTP proxy, curl will be using the CONNECT verb.)

Detecting the right proxy for a given address (and yes, it's expected
to do that per-address) is hard?. It's been a "nice to have" feature in
curl for years: https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcurl.se%2Fdocs%2Ftodo.html%23auto_detect_proxy&data=05%7C01%7Ctim.howard%40dec.ny.gov%7Cba9855f6b8bd4d23531e08db52069dd1%7Cf46cb8ea79004d108ceb80e8c1c81ee7%7C0%7C0%7C638193960595128444%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Ucxe4e4OK%2BSUzB9dhhBPrtcb%2FlLF3bcq6tC1OocY8IM%3D&reserved=0<https://curl.se/docs/todo.html#auto_detect_proxy>, so
I'm afraid it won't happen any time soon. It's unfortunate that the
curl back-end will break something that used to work with wininet.

I wonder whether it could make sense to call
WinHttpGetIEProxyConfigForCurrentUser() [*] when setting up connections
on Windows. There's no simple way to deal with the proxy
auto-configuration file [**], but we could at least call
curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_PROXY,
wchar_to_current_locale(proxy_config->lpszProxy)); to make the
transition from wininet to curl slightly less painful. Or would that
break even more installations? This won't help in the more complicated
cases [***], though.

Those results were expected. The problem seems to stem from R 4.3.0 on 
FreeBSD 13.2-RELEASE (I do not have other platforms to test).

Hello, I'm trying to create a line graph with a legend, but have no 
success controlling the legend. Since nothing I've tried seems to work, 
I must be doing something systematically wrong. Can anyone point this 
out to me?

Here's my data:
 > weights
# A tibble: 1,246 ? 3
    Date           J     K
    <date>     <dbl> <dbl>
  1 2000-02-13   133  188
  2 2000-02-20   134  185
  3 2000-02-27   135  187
  4 2000-03-05   135  185
  5 2000-03-12    NA  184
  6 2000-03-19    NA  184.
  7 2000-03-26   136  184.
  8 2000-04-02   134  185
  9 2000-04-09   133  186
10 2000-04-16    NA  186
# ? 1,236 more rows
# ? Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows
 >

Here's my attempts. You can see some of the things I've tried in the 
commented out sections:
weights %>%
     group_by(year(Date)) %>%
     summarize(
         m_K = mean(K, na.rm = TRUE),
         m_J = mean(J, na.rm = TRUE),
         ) %>%
     ggplot(aes(x = `year(Date)`)) +
     geom_point(aes(y = m_K, color = "red")) +
     geom_smooth(aes(y = m_K, color = "red")) +
     geom_point(aes(y = m_J, color = "blue")) +
     geom_smooth(aes(y = m_J, color = "blue")) +
     guides(size = "legend",
            shape = "legend")
     ## scale_shape_discrete(name="Person",
     ##                      breaks=c("m_K", "m_J"),
     ##                      labels=c("K", "J"))
     ## theme(legend.title=element_blank())

When this runs, the blue line for "K" is above the red line for "J", as 
I expect, but in the legend, the red is shown first, and labeled "blue."

I'd like to be able to create a legend where the first entry shows a 
blue line and is labeled "K" and the second is red and labeled "J".

On a different but related topic, I'd welcome any advice or suggestions 
on my methodology in this example. Is this the correct way to summarize 
with a mean? Do I need the two sets of geom_point and geom_line clauses 
to create this graph, or is there a better way?

Thanks for all your advice and guidance.

-Kevin

Hello,

This is mainly a data reshaping problem. Insteadof plotting two 
variables, J and K, if the data is in the long format you will map the 
column with these variables names to the color aesthetic and call each 
geom_* only once. Then, assign the colors you want.

As for placing K above J, note that ggplot places them by alphabetical 
order unless you coerce to factor with the levels in the order you want.

Also, if you want to compute aggregate statistics for several columns, 
use ?across. See the code below.

Here is a complete example. I have augmented your data set in order to 
have more years to plot.



# augment the data set
weights <- " Date           J     K
   1 2000-02-13   133  188
   2 2000-02-20   134  185
   3 2000-02-27   135  187
   4 2000-03-05   135  185
   5 2000-03-12    NA  184
   6 2000-03-19    NA  184.
   7 2000-03-26   136  184.
   8 2000-04-02   134  185
   9 2000-04-09   133  186
10 2000-04-16    NA  186"
weights <- read.table(text = weights, header = TRUE)
weights$Date <- as.Date(weights$Date)
tmp <- weights
tmp <- lapply(1:10, \(y) {
   tmp$Date <- years(y) + tmp$Date
   tmp$J <- tmp$J + sample(-10:10, nrow(weights), TRUE)
   tmp$K <- tmp$K + sample(-10:10, nrow(weights), TRUE)
   tmp
})
weights <- do.call(rbind, tmp)

#---

# plot code
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(lubridate)

weights %>%
     mutate(Year = year(Date)) %>%
     group_by(Year) %>%
     summarize(across(J:K, mean, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
     # now reshape the data
     pivot_longer(-Year) %>%
     # uncomment the next line if you want K
     # to show up on top in the legend
     # mutate(name = factor(name, levels = c("K", "J"))) %>%
     ggplot(aes(Year, value, color = name)) +
     geom_smooth(
         formula = y ~ x,
         method = lm,
         se = FALSE
     ) +
     geom_point() +
     scale_color_manual(values = c(J = "red", K = "blue"))



Hope this helps,

Subject: [R] aggregate wind direction data with wind speed required
Message-ID: <879769e2d65d41e89bf0ca6593a78e04@regione.marche.it>

Dear list users,

I have to aggregate wind direction data (wd) using a function that requires also a second input variable, wind speed (ws).

This is the function that I need to use:


my_fun <- function(wd1, ws1){

  u_component <- -ws1*sin(2*pi*wd1/360)
  v_component <- -ws1*cos(2*pi*wd1/360)
  mean_u <- mean(u_component, na.rm=T)
  mean_v <- mean(v_component, na.rm=T)
  mean_wd <- (atan2(mean_u, mean_v) * 360/2/pi) + 180
  result <- mean_wd
  result
}

Does the aggregate function work only with functions with a single input variable (the one that I want to aggregate), or its use can be extended to functions with two input variables?

Here a simple example (which is meaningless, the important think is the concept behind it):
df <- data.frame(day=c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3), month=c(1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2), wd=c(45, 90, 90, 135, 180, 270, 270, 315), ws=c(7, 7, 8, 3, 2, 7, 14, 13))

aggregate(wd ~ day + month, data=df, FUN = my_fun)

cannot work, because ws is not taken into consideration.

I got lost. Any hint, any help?
I hope to have been able to explain my problem.
Thank you for your attention,
Stefano

Hello,

Use the dots argument to pass any number of named arguments to your 
aggregation function.
In this case, ws1 = ws at the end of the aggregate call.


aggregate(wd ~ day + month, data=df, FUN = my_fun, ws1 = ws)


You can also give the user the option to remove or not NA's by adding a 
na.rm argument:


my_fun <- function(wd1, ws1, na.rm = FALSE) {
   [...]
   mean_u <- mean(u_component, na.rm = na.rm)
   mean_v <- mean(v_component, na.rm = na.rm)
   [...]
}

aggregate(wd ~ day + month, data=df, FUN = my_fun, ws1 = ws, na.rm = TRUE)


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Dear Eric thanks for your code,

Dear R-experts,

Here below my R code, still the same error message at the end while trying to tune the parameters!?
Any hints to make it work would be appreciated.

Best,

Hi Sacha,
On second thought, perhaps this is more the direction that you want ...

X2 = cbind(X_train,y_train)
colnames(X2)[3] = "y"
regr2<-randomForest(y~x1+x2, data=X2,maxnodes=10, ntree=10)
regr
regr2

#Make prediction
predictions= predict(regr, X_test)
predictions2= predict(regr2, X_test)

HTH,
Eric

Sorry Rui; if you run your code you will get:
Error in FUN(X[[i]], ...) : object 'ws' not found

Moreover, even if you did this:
aggregate(wd ~ day + month, data=df, FUN = my_fun, ws1 = df$ws)
 the answer would be wrong is you need to include only the subsets of ws1
corresponding to the split defined by day + month in each call to my_fun.
aggregate() does not do this (the ... argument is evaluated only once, not
once per subset).

So I think the answer to Stefano's question is no, aggregate doesn't work.
You should use by() or tapply() instead:

##Warning: I haven't checked this carefully. So please do!

>  by(df, list(df$day,df$month), FUN = \(x)with(x, my_fun(wd, ws)))

Cheers,
Bert

I think that using complex numbers to represent the wind velocity makes
this simpler.  You would need to write some simple conversion functions
since wind directions are typically measured clockwise from north and the
argument of a complex number is measured counterclockwise from east.  E.g.,

windToComplex <-
function(speed, degreesCW) {
  complex(mod=speed, arg=(90-degreesCW)/180*pi)
}
complexToWind <-
function(z) {
  # Convert complex velocity z to speed and direction (degrees clockwise
  # from north, in range [0,360)).
  stopifnot(is.complex(z))
  data.frame(speed = Mod(z), degreesCW = (pi - Arg(z*1i))/(2*pi)*360)
}

Then use FUN=mean instead of my_fun.

You don't have to bother with the subtracting from pi/2 bit ... just assume the cartesian complex values are (y,x) instead of (x,y).

Do you at least know whether it's an HTTP proxy, a SOCKS proxy, or
something completely different? Do you need to authenticate to the
proxy?

> How I can add my proxy and port to my R configuration?

libcurl recognises the "http_proxy" environment variable, which can
include the protocol, the address and the port of the proxy server:
https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY.html

For example, if you have a SOCKS5 hostname-resolving proxy on address
192.2.0.1 and port 1080, you can try calling Sys.setenv('http_proxy' =
'socks5h://192.2.0.1:1080'). For a different example, an HTTP proxy on
198.51.100.2, port 8080 can be set up as Sys.setenv('http_proxy' =
'http://198.51.100.2:8080'). (In both cases, the proxy will be used by
curl for HTTP and HTTPS access, but not, say, FTP or other protocols.
For HTTPS via HTTP proxy, curl will be using the CONNECT verb.)

Detecting the right proxy for a given address (and yes, it's expected
to do that per-address) is hard?. It's been a "nice to have" feature in
curl for years: https://curl.se/docs/todo.html#auto_detect_proxy, so
I'm afraid it won't happen any time soon. It's unfortunate that the
curl back-end will break something that used to work with wininet.

I wonder whether it could make sense to call
WinHttpGetIEProxyConfigForCurrentUser() [*] when setting up connections
on Windows. There's no simple way to deal with the proxy
auto-configuration file [**], but we could at least call
curl_easy_setopt(handle, CURLOPT_PROXY,
wchar_to_current_locale(proxy_config->lpszProxy)); to make the
transition from wininet to curl slightly less painful. Or would that
break even more installations? This won't help in the more complicated
cases [***], though.

Hello,

Please include data and the code you tried in your questions to R-Help.
We'll be glad to help but like this it is not possible to do so.

Hi,

You are using the prop_test() function from the infer CRAN package, with an argument set for an example using the prop_test() function from the rstatix CRAN package.

They are **not** the same function, and do not take the same arguments, even though they have the same name.

Read the help page for the prop_test() function in the infer package, where 'x' is supposed to be a data frame, not a vector, and there is no 'n' argument.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Dear R-users,
I'm probably using R too sparsely to solve a very trivial difficulty, as I didn't find any clear example in the tutorials on the net.

I ran an ACP and a classification with the following script:

library(ade4)
library(stats)
library(cluster)

x<-read.table(file.choose (),sep="\t",header=T) # lecture des donn?es: sp?cimens en lignes, variable en colonnes s?par?es par des tabulations

labels <- x[,1] # ?tiquettes des sp?cimens

x <- x[,-1] # s?lection des valeurs

acp<- dudi.pca(x , scannf= F,scale=T,center=T,nf=4) #  analyse en composantes principales

s.label(acp$li, xax = 1, yax = 2,  labels) # affichage des ?tiquettes des specimens

s.corcircle(acp$co) # corr?lation entre les variables et les axes principaux

mat<-dist(x) # distances entre sp?cimens deux ? deux

specimens<-mat

plot(hclust(specimens,"ward.D2"),hang=-1,ylab="distance",main="Classification des sp?cimens")

The resulting dendrogram is nice but I would like to have on the resulting plot the labels of each specimen in place of the number of the rows.

I really would be very happy if someone has some time to complete/fix my script or indicate an explicit tutorial.

Why can you not use the 'labels' argument as described in ?hclust (the Help
system should always be the first place to look for answers to such
questions):

## i.e.
plot(hclust(specimens,"ward.D2"),hang=-1, labels = x[,1],
ylab="distance",main="Classification des sp?cimens")

... or is there something about your example that I misunderstand?

Hello,

I's still working with my tsibble of weight data for the last 20 years. 
In addition to drawing an overall trend line, using lm, for the whole 
data set, I'd like to draw short lines that would recompute lm and draw 
it, say, just for the years from 2010:2015.

Here's a short example that I think illustrates what I'm trying to do. 
The commented out sections show what I've tried to far:

## Short example to test segments:

w <- tsibble(
     date = as.Date("2022-01-01") + 0:99,
     value = rnorm(100)
)

ggplot(data = w, mapping = aes(date, value)) +
     geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
     geom_point()
     ## Below gives error about ignoring data
     ## geom_abline( data = w$date[25:75] )
     ## Gives error ''data' must be in <data.frame>'
     ## geom_smooth(data = w$date[25:35],
     ##             method = lm,
     ##             color = "black",
     ##             se = FALSE)

I'm thinking that this is probably easily done, but I'm struggling with 
how to subset the data in the middle of the pipeline.

Thanks for any advice and help.

-Kevin

Hello,

Try the following.
In the 2nd geom_smooth you need a subset of the data not of just one of 
its columns.



suppressPackageStartupMessages({
   library(tsibble)
   library(dplyr)
   library(ggplot2)
   library(lubridate)
})

ggplot(data = w, mapping = aes(date, value)) +
   geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
   geom_point() +
   geom_smooth(
     data = w %>% filter(year(date) >= 2010, year(date) <= 2015),
     mapping = aes(date, value),
     formula = y ~ x,
     method = lm,
     color = "black",
     se = FALSE
   )


Other ways to subset the data are


# dplyr
data = w %>% filter(year(date) %in% 2010:2015)
# base R
data = subset(w, year(date) %in% 2010:2015)


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Yep, that did it. I didn't know that you could have pipelines within 
pipelines.

Thanks, again, for all your help.

Yes, I was confused that I associated  "K" with the color red, yet the 
line and points for K's data were blue, but in the legend, was labeled 
with the word "red".

But, I think I've got it straightened out now. Thanks for your help.

R Help

 

I have a data.frame where I've broken out the year <dbl> and an ordered
month <ord> values. But I need to recombine them so I can graph mon-year in
order but when I recombine I lose the month order and the results are
plotted alphabetical.

 

Year        month  mon_year            

<dbl>     <ord> 

2021     Mar        Mar-2021

2021     Jan         Jan-2021

2021     Apr         Apr-2021

 

So do I need to convert the months back to an integer then recombine to
plot.

There are many ways to do this in various R packages. Search on "Plot
month-year data in R" or the like and choose that which works best for you.
There may be a learning curve involved, naturally.

(Note: you may wish to check out zoo:yearmon and zoo:autoplot first, as
these seem like they might be a good fit to your task. You decide, of
course.)

Hello,

You can use function as.yearmon in package zoo to get the correct 
month/year order.



df1 <- data.frame(Year = c(2021, 2021, 2021),
                   Mon = c("Mar", "Jan", "Apr"))

df1$mon_year <- zoo::as.yearmon(paste(df1$Mon, df1$Year))

sort(df1$mon_year)
#> [1] "Jan 2021" "Mar 2021" "Apr 2021"



Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Subject: [R] mclapply enters into an infinite loop....

Dear members,
                         I am using arfima in an mclapply construction (from the parallel package):

Browse[2]> LYG <- mclapply(LYGH, FUN = arfima, mc.cores = detectCores())
^C
Browse[2]> LYG <- mclapply(LYGH[1:10], FUN = arfima, mc.cores = detectCores())
^C
Browse[2]> LYG <- mclapply(LYGH[1:2], FUN = arfima, mc.cores = detectCores())
^C

You can see that I am aborting the execution of mclapply. It doesn't finish even if I reduce the elements to be iterated over to 2. Why is it entering an infinite loop?

Please exhort me if this is to be posted in HPC list.

THanking you,
Yours sincerely,
ALSHAY M KULKARNI

I don't use lubridate, but that package works with Date and POSIXt types, which I do use. Just remember to include a day when converting (1st of month is typical), and use an output format to hide the day when you plot.

It does not look to me like you are providing the necessary arguments to arfima.

Try making this work with lapply first... then try mclapply.

Hi

Hope you are well. I work for NHS England and I have been asked to conduct a security review of R, I am unable to locate information around the security posture of R. Would someone please be able to direct me to the correct page or alternatively answer the questions below:


  *   When was the application last updated?
  *   How often is it updated?
  *   Are there any guidance that is followed such as OWASP Application Security Verification Standards?
  *   Do you conform with a recognised security standard? (e.g., SOC1/2/3, ISO27001)
  *   Do you have an Information Security Policy with supporting Standards and Procedures? Please provide details (or provide a copy of the policy).
  *   Do you have formal change control and release management processes to manage code changes? Please provide details (or provide a copy of the documented process).
  *   Is the source code anywhere? If so where is and is it secure?
  *   Do you follow secure development processes? How is this achieved?
  *   Are there any common vulnerabilities?
  *   Is there a reporting process for reporting vulnerabilities and remediation processes? Please provide details/a copy of the documented process
  *   Do you undertake audits or other reviews to ensure that security controls are being implemented and operating effectively? How is this done? Can you provide details of this?
  *   Do you undertake regular penetration testing (or similar technical security testing, code review or vulnerability assessment); and are you able to provide a summary of results/findings?
  *   Do your employees (e.g., developers or system administrators) have access to customer data? How is this access controlled and monitored?
  *   Are all personnel required to sign Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) or Confidentiality Agreements (CA) as a condition of employment to protect customer information?
  *   Do you have Business Continuity and/or Disaster Recovery Plans? If Yes, please provide details including backup and redundancy mechanisms.
  *   Is there a  dedicated security team?
  *   Is there a contact for security issues?
  *   Has a vulnerability disclosure program?
  *   Is there a bug bounty program?
  *   Does R require third party authorization/connections?

This information is publicly available at
<https://developer.r-project.org/> by looking for "Release plans". You
can reach this page by starting at <https://www.r-project.org/> and
clicking the "Developer Pages" link. The developer pages are admittedly
harder to navigate than the main website, but I think that they could
answer some of your other questions too.

You can also obtain this information by looking for "News" under
<https://www.r-project.org/> and by checking the dates of all released
versions of R at <https://cloud.r-project.org/src/base/>.

>   *   Is the source code anywhere? If so where is

Yes, you can download release source code by following the "download R"

What would be considered a vulnerability in a piece of software that
was never supposed to be a security boundary?

(Will R run arbitrary code typed at its prompt? Yes, by design. Is it
possible to feed maliciously-constructed data into R's unserialize()
and cause arbitrary code execution this way? Probably, but typing code
at the prompt is much easier. Can third-party R packages that start TCP
servers be convinced to run arbitrary code on attacker's behalf?
Consider that a given.)

> have access to customer data?

By itself, R processes any data fed into it locally, on the computer
where it's running, without contacting R developers about it.

The same cannot be guaranteed about third-party packages, although
there are tests and reviews at both CRAN and Bioconductor in order to
prevent the packages from doing anything considered "anti-social". (See
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html> for more
information on this.) A sufficiently motivated malicious actor could
circumvent them, of course, but that can be said about anything.

If someone at NHS wants to use R, they will probably want to use CRAN
and Bioconductor packages too. Potentially, they might need packages
published elsewhere as well. All these packages will have to be
reviewed separately from R, because they are maintained by different
people.

>   *   Does R require third party authorization/connections?

No, but shouldn't you be more concerned with third-party software
dependencies?

(Did you mean to ask these questions at the public mailing list open
for J. Random Hackers like me to answer?)

Actually, people typically ask "the R Foundation" or even
individual RF / R-core members such as me about this ...

... as if we were a company with staff to answer such questions;
but we (volunteering individuals) really do *not* have the time
resources for that,
and consequently, also in my function---shared with another few
individuals---as gatekeeper to the R foundation / R core / R webmaster
e-mail addresses, I typically deflect such questions to the
public web sites *and* public e-mail lists.

The big advantage of this approach is that at least the answers
are findable by web searches in the future, and so, hopefully
have to be answered less frequently by volunteers as you, Ivan,
for whom we are really very grateful.

Dear Jeff,
                There was a problem in LYGH and lapply threw an error, but mclapply got stuck in an infinite loop. The doc for mclapply says that mclapply runs under try() with silent = TRUE. So that means mclapply should run properly, i.e output a try class object and exit. But it didn't. Can you shed some light on why this happened?

THanking you,
Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

It does not look to me like you are providing the necessary arguments to arfima.

Try making this work with lapply first... then try mclapply.

Chris

Presumably you've also pointed her to the NHS R community and in particular
is slack group?

There are so many variables in what was even being asked it's going to take
some time to work through, did the mean R or R Studio or R Studio Cloud...
Before any packages..

so it seems prudent to point a link here for eternity -- because there will
be another NHS Security Audit with questions that don't fit R properly and
the guys in the community may be best placed to answer them

What's your sessionInfo()? Are you using a GUI frontend?

mclapply() relies on the fork() system call, which is tricky to get
right in a process where other threads may exist at the same time: when
a process calls fork(), the child process ends up with the same
contents of virtual memory but no other threads at all. If a thread was
holding a lock when the process was forked, the lock will never be
released in the child process, leaving it stuck. Depending on how
you're running R, it may be threading issues or something else.

More information may be obtained by looking at traceback() after you
interrupt mclapply() (easy, but low information: did you interrupt
selectChildren() or some other function?) and attaching a C debugger to
the child process when you become sure it's stuck (hard, requires
additional preparation such as installing debugging symbols).

Subject: [R] suprising behaviour of tryCatch()
Message-ID: <AS4PR07MB84579BE1B83EF94BA79A6965917E9@AS4PR07MB8457.eurprd07.prod.outlook.com>

Hello,

I run a fisher.test() in a loop, with the issue that some of the data will not be useable. To protect the loop I used tryCatch but:

sexsnp = rep(NA, 1750)
for(i in 1:1750){tryCatch(sexsnp[i] = fisher.test(table(data[,3], data[,i + 38]))$p, error = function(e) print(NA))}
Error: unexpected '=' in "for(i in 1:1750){tryCatch(sexsnp[i] ="

But this works:

for(i in 1:1750){tryCatch(sexsnp[i] <- fisher.test(table(data[,3], data[,i + 38]))$p, error = function(e) print(NA))}
[1] NA
[1] NA
[1] NA

The only difference is the use of ?=? or ?<-? to assign the p value of the fisher test to the vector.  I stopped using ?<-? eons ago so it took a bit to figure out.

Tested on R 4.1.2 on ContOS 8 , and on  R 4.3.0 on a M1 mac with the same result.  I?d be obliged if someone can explain why tryCatch assigns items with ?<-? and not ?=?.

The '=' has a context-dependent meaning - in a function call it is used to
name arguments and outside of a function call it is used for assignments.
This has nothing to do with tryCatch in particular.  E.g.,

> f <- function(x) x + 100
> f(y <- 10)
[1] 110
> y
[1] 10
> f(y = 20)
Error in f(y = 20) : unused argument (y = 20)
> y
[1] 10


I recommend starting to use <- for assignments again (or not doing
assignments inside of function calls).

It is not just tryCatch but any function.  In function calls the "=" is
used to assign actual arguments to formal arguments, not for
assignments.  

That is why "plot(fm <- lm(eruptions ~ waiting, faithful)" works but
"plot(fm = lm(eruptions ~ waiting, faithful)" does not.

The only universal assignment operator, AFAIK, is "<-".  Well, and "->".
Long time ago "_" used to be one too, but that is long ago.  

The usual advice was that if you do not know when "=" does not work as
assignment operator then always use "<-" for assignments. :)

The final thing you have to take care of that in function calls you
have to be sure that the argument is actually evaluated (R has lazy
evaluation) to ensure that the assignment is actually executed.

Because `<-` and `=` do different things (and I am one of the old
fossils that wish they had not been confounded).

`fun(x <- expr)`  Assigns the value of `expr` to the variable `x` in
the frame/environment that `fun` is called from.
`fun(x = expr)` Assigns the value of `expr`to the variable `x` in the
frame/environment created for and used by `fun` subject to the rules
of argument matching.

These are very different (see documentation/tutorials on variable
scoping if you do not already understand how different these are).

As a simple analogy, think of a function like the refrigerator in your house.

refrigerator( topshelf = bottle )  will put the bottle on the top
shelf inside of the refrigerator
refrigerator( topshelf <- bottle ) will put the bottle on the top
shelf in the same room that the refrigerator is in (but not in the
fridge itself)


When you run the code with `<-` it, then the ith element of the global
variable `sexsnp` is assigned the p-value.  When you run the version
with `=` then R tries to find an argument to `tryCatch` that matches
(possibly partially) `sexsnp[i]` and gives the error because it does
not find a match (not sure why it is not handled by `...`, but
tryCatch may be parsed special, or non-legal argument names on the RHS
of `-` may be checked).

Unfortunately allowing `=` in certain common places to mimic `<-`
hides this difference and leads to these types of errors when the
difference is important.

Try:

R> for(i in 1:1750){tryCatch(eval(expression("sexsnp[i] = fisher.test(table(data[,3], data[,i+38]))$p")), error=function(e)print(NA))}

or

R> for(i in 1:1750){tryCatch(bquote("sexsnp[i] = fisher.test(table(data[,3], data[,i+38]))$p"), error=function(e) print(NA))}

or 

R> for(i in 1:1750){tryCatch(.("sexsnp[i] = fisher.test(table(data[,3], data[,i+38]))$p"), error=function(e) print(NA))}

If you want to use the '='.

... or just put the R expression inside curly brackets, e.g.

tryCatch({
  sexsnp[i] = fisher.test(table(data[,3], data[,i+38]))$p
}, error=function(e) print(NA))

Exercise: Compare

$a
[1] 2

with

> list({ a = 2 })
[[1]]
[1] 2

and

> list(b = { a = 2 })
$b
[1] 2

BTW, note how the latter two assigned a <- 2 to the global environment.

Only if the argument 'x' is evaluated during the function call AFAIK.
If it is not, due to lazy evaluation rules, then no assignment takes
place.

After exact matching on names comes partial matching on names and then
positional matching.  If after these three rounds there are still
actual arguments left over, they are assigned to "..." (if it exist as
formal argument).

So under the usual rules of how actual arguments
are passed to formal arguments in Federico's call the argument
"sexsnp[i] = fisher.test(table(data[,3], data[,i + 38]))$p" should be
assigned to the formal argument "expr" of tryCatch() and "error =
function(e) print(NA))" should be absorbed by "...".

But it seems, as "=" has a different meaning in function call, the
expression passed to the "expr" formal argument is not allowed to
contain a "=".  Not sure why. :-)

I guess that the intended use is actually:

R> for(i in 1:1750){sexsnp[i] = tryCatch(fisher.test(table(data[,3], data[,i + 38]))$p, error = function(e) print(NA))}

I.e. tryCatch() returns the result of the evaluated expression (if
successful, otherwise the result of an error handler) and that result
can be assigned.  It is not expected the that expression contains an
assignment operation.  But I am just guessing. :)

Cheers,

	Berwin

Respected Sir
Good Evening. My name is V.Suriya, I am a research scholar. Doing my Ph.D
at University of Madras, Tamil Nadu, India. I need the r code for random
forest count data. It helps me lot to complete my research work sir.

And also need the r code for comparison of predictors with the help of
mtry, best size, best node.

Thanks and Regards

This is R-**Help**, not R- **we give you all the answers.** Please
read and follow the posting guide linked below for what sorts of
questions are appropriate for this list and what you should include
when asking them.

Incidentally, there are several packages in R that do (versions of)
random forests. You can read about at least some of them in the
**Random Forests** section of the Machine Learning Task View here:
https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=MachineLearning

Many R packages have, besides extensive Help pages, so-called
"vignettes", tutorials that help you use them. If available, you
should consult these before posting here.

With the support of the R Foundation Conference Committee, we are happy to
announce the promotion of regional R events to connect our R community and
bridge us till useR! 2024.

On July 21st we hold an event in Basel, with all ticket sales for the
Basel event being directly donated to the R Foundation. Similar events are
being planned in Shanghai and San Francisco this summer.

Basel event link (call for abstracts is currently open):
https://user-regional-2023.gitlab.io/basel/

We also wanted to help promote events beyond those organised in
collaboration with the R Foundation and R User Group (RUGs), so are hosting
this dashboard of R events this summer which will also include the Shanghai
and San Francisco events when they are launched:

Hi all,

Does anyone have experience estimating the sample size for beta
regression? I have three treatment groups with 0.6, 0.5 and 0.3 mean of
proportions. I tried use BetaPASS but failed,

Message-ID: <CAM+rpY=20trHXoUaVFqE5_qVMu9f6Uafc98KVwLjf1s0g-PmAQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm attempting to describe the height of a fall from a building, so the
vertical orientation has a certain attraction.

dd <- data.frame(nothing = rep(1:2, each = 6), height = runif(n=12, min=0,
max=30))
dd

## pretty much what I'm looking for
with(dd, stripchart(height, vertical = TRUE))

## but if possible  would like to do it with lattice and pipes
library(lattice)
library(dplyr)

dd %>% stripplot(~height, data = .)  ## default is horizontal
dd %>% stripplot(~height, data = ., horizontal = FALSE)    ## no
dd %>% stripplot(height ~, data = ., horizontal = FALSE)   ## a guess,
clearly not right
dd %>% stripplot(height ~ 1, data = ., horizontal = FALSE)  ## close, but
x-axis label and tic labels undesired
dd %>% stripplot(height ~ 1, data = ., horizontal = FALSE, xlab = NULL)  ##
closer
dd %>% stripplot(height ~ "", data = ., horizontal = FALSE)

The last line gets pretty much what I'm looking for, but it feels a bit . .
. unseemly.  height ~ "" ? There must be a more proper way, that I'm just
not thinking of.

Thanks.

Well, my aesthetic sense is not offended, so:

dd |> stripplot(height ~ "", data = _, horizontal = FALSE)
## seems fine to me.

## But if you prefer, the following is a more verbose but maybe more
"seemly" version :-)  :
 dd |> stripplot(height ~ 1, data = _, horizontal = FALSE,
          xlab = "", scales = list(x = list(draw = FALSE)))
******************
Notes:
1. You can use R's native pipe operator instead of magrittr's (one less package)
2. The "scales" argument controls tick marks and their labels for axis
in lattice. See ?xyplot for details.

Dear Ivan,
                 REgrets to reply this late...

By "holding a lock", you mean a bug in the process right (I am not a computer science guy, excuse my naivete)?

THanking you,
Yours sincerely,

What's your sessionInfo()? Are you using a GUI frontend?

mclapply() relies on the fork() system call, which is tricky to get
right in a process where other threads may exist at the same time: when
a process calls fork(), the child process ends up with the same
contents of virtual memory but no other threads at all. If a thread was
holding a lock when the process was forked, the lock will never be
released in the child process, leaving it stuck. Depending on how
you're running R, it may be threading issues or something else.

More information may be obtained by looking at traceback() after you
interrupt mclapply() (easy, but low information: did you interrupt
selectChildren() or some other function?) and attaching a C debugger to
the child process when you become sure it's stuck (hard, requires
additional preparation such as installing debugging symbols).

Ivan

Well... one person's bug ("your threaded program breaks if I fork() the
process") is another person's documented behaviour ("of course it
does, it says 'please do not fork()' right in the manual"). Depending
on how you're running R (which operating system? are you using a
front-end? a multi-threaded BLAS?), this may be applicable, hence the
question about sessionInfo().

A GUI program may need multiple threads in order to stay responsive
(without looking hung and forgetting to repaint its window or
something) while doing something significant in the background. A
multi-threaded linear algebra library may create a thread per CPU core
in order to take your matrix products faster. Inside a process, some
resources have to be shared between the threads, like the bathroom in a
flat rented by multiple people together. "Holding a lock" is like
taking the key to the bathroom with the intent to occupy it for a
while: a completely normal action that prevents embarrassing accidents.

When you fork() a process, though, it ends up creating an exact copy of
the flat (process) just for you (the current thread), with none of the
flat-mates (other threads). If the bathroom was locked by someone else,
it stays locked, and there's no key anywhere.

There do exist mechanisms like pthread_atfork() that could be used to
prevent problems like this, but for that to work, *every* piece of code
that may be creating threads and taking locks inside your process
should be using them right. (The flat-mates need to know to give you
any keys they might be holding before the flat is fork()ed. It's enough
for one of them to forget one key to cause a problem.) The pragmatic
solution may be to avoid fork() and threads being used together.

Dear Ivan,
                 I was on RHEL 8 with aws Ec2 z1d instance.

I infer by your words that this "bug" happens only sometimes..But I disagree...I run the same code multiple times within a span of 5 minutes, and the problem persisted....Anyway I have removed the bug in the function and I hope that mclapply runs properly now( if it doesn't you are my only saviour!)

Many thanks for your geekish explanation.

THanking you,
Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI
