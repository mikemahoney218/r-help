Subject: [R] 2 bands (confidence and prediction) on the same GAM plot?

Dear R-experts,

Here below my R code (toy example) working! The only thing missing is in my GAM plot: I would like to get on the same graph the 2 bands (prediction and confidence bands) like in my lm model graph!
Is it possible? How to get that?

Dear All,

I have a dataset which contains date and 12 other countries data. I
have extracted the data as xts object.

I am not able to recall all the series in the Y axis. My data set
looks like this

My code for the same is as follows

ggplot(data=data_vol3, aes(x=index, y=data_vol3$usa)+
  geom_line())

Any help in this regard will be highly appreciated

Well you don't need to say that the y data are from data_vol3, your data 
= declaration says that.

I wonder if what you want is:

library(tidyverse)

tribble(
 ? ~rowN, ~index, ~crepub, ~finland, ~france, ~germany, ~italy, 
~netherlands, ~norway, ~poland,
 ? 1, "2005-01-03", 1.21, 0.615, 1.90, 3.01, 0.346, 0.509, 1.05, 1.13,
 ? 2, "2005-01-04", 1.18, 0.615, 1.85, 2.89, 0.346, 0.509, 0.889, 1.12,
 ? 3, "2005-01-05", 1.15, 0.615, 1.81, 2.78, 0.346, 0.509, 0.785, 1.09,
 ? 4, "2005-01-06", 1.11, 0.615, 1.76, 2.67, 0.346, 0.509, 0.711, 1.06,
 ? 5, "2005-01-07", 1.08, 0.615, 1.72, 2.57, 0.346, 0.509, 0.661, 1.02,
 ? 6, "2005-01-10", 1.04, 0.615, 1.69, 2.48, 0.346, 0.509, 0.630, 1.01) 
-> data_vol3

### please give us data using dput in future: saves us having to do 
something like that to reclaim it!

### pivot that longer to make it easy to get country data as separate lines

data_vol3 %>%? select(-rowN) %>%
 ? pivot_longer(cols = -index, # as you want to pivot the other 
variables/columns
 ?????????????? names_to = "countries") -> tibDataVol3Long

ggplot(data = tibDataVol3Long,
 ?????? aes(x = index, y = value,
 ???????????? ### now get the grouping and use it for a colour legend
 ???????????? group = countries, colour = countries)) +
 ? geom_line()

Dear Upananda,

to complement the current response to your question, your data
source looks like a "wide table" while you would certainly need them to
be organised as a "long table", or to speak differently as a "tidy
table". You should read this source in order to get a grasp on these
issues:

https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html

Please note that the etiquette on this list states that example data
should conform to some constraints that your message does not conform
to (you shoud therefore also read the posting guide:
http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html).

Yours. 
Olivier.

Reorganize the data so that you have three columns
Something more like this:

Date                      Country      Value
2005-01-03          Crepub        1.21

You ggplot statement has a mistake. The geom_line() should be outside the ggplot() call.

You might then have a ggplot statement like
ggplot(data=data_vol3, aes(x=Country, y=Value)) + geom_line()

Just make sure that the data type(s) are what they need to be. Country is non-numeric, and I am not sure geom_line() will like that. I am not sure why one might draw a line connecting categorical items.

ggplot(data=data_vol3, aes(x=index, y=data_vol3$usa)+
  geom_line())

Any help in this regard will be highly appreciated

With regards,
Upananda Pani

Hi Chris,

Thank for your solutions and time. I am getting the following error
while trying to execute the code you suggested.

Error in select(., -rowN) : unused argument (-rowN)

Upananda

Hi Chrish,

I am grateful to you for your reply. Your code is working fine.
Moreover, you have guided me how to improve my knowledge, I appreciate
it. I will be very careful next time.
The data which i am working on is given below:

dput(head(data_vol3))
structure(list(index = structure(c(12786, 12787, 12788, 12789,
12790, 12793), tzone = "UTC", tclass = "Date", class = "Date"),

    ), norway = c(1.052509528, 0.889357215, 0.784607722, 0.710551664,

    ), slovenia = c(0.831886154, 0.831945994, 0.832003445, 0.832058602,
    0.832111556, 0.832162397), uk = c(1.504813191, 1.463648326,

    )), row.names = c(NA, -6L), class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"
))

As there are some countries which are having higher volatilities than
countries with lower, is there any suggestion to improve the graph?

Looking forward to your suggestion in this regard.

With sincere regards,
Upananda Pani

I know it doesn't feel a very sympathetic piece of advice, but I think you need to spend some days working on your understanding of R, ggplot and the tidyverse realm of R.  You can use ggplot() without using much of the tidyverse but they are designed to complement each other and the more I understand of the tidyverse way of doing things, the better I use ggplot().

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] gsDesign2 1.0.8 is released
Message-ID: <8e6617ab-a4aa-4a9c-927d-133e0cd846e5@app.fastmail.com>

Dear all,

A new version of gsDesign2 (1.0.8) is now on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=gsDesign2). gsDesign2 enables fixed or group sequential design under non-proportional hazards and supports highly flexible enrollment, time-to-event, and time-to-dropout assumptions.

The key improvements in this version include refined naming conventions for options in the info_scale argument adhering to the tidyverse design guide, and bug fixes for computing the futility bounds. Please see the changelog (https://merck.github.io/gsDesign2/news/) for details.

As the gsDesign2 package is still in its early stages, we're eager to continue refining its features and performance. We invite you to try out this new version and share your insights with us. Your feedback is invaluable in helping us develop a tool that meets the evolving needs of users.

Cheers,
-Nan

Dear Upananda,

I see a misplaced bracket in your code, and there is no need in aes() to call the dataframe explicitly. Does this work?

ggplot(data = data_vol3, aes(x = index, y = usa)) +
  geom_line()

Best wishes,
Thomas

Betreff: [R] Reg: Help regarding ggplot2

Dear All,

I have a dataset which contains date and 12 other countries data. I
have extracted the data as xts object.

I am not able to recall all the series in the Y axis. My data set
looks like this

index      crepub finland france germany italy netherlands norway poland
  <date>      <dbl>   <dbl>  <dbl>   <dbl> <dbl>       <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>

2 2005-01-04   1.18   0.615   1.85    2.89 0.346       0.509  0.889   1.12
3 2005-01-05   1.15   0.615   1.81    2.78 0.346       0.509  0.785   1.09

5 2005-01-07   1.08   0.615   1.72    2.57 0.346       0.509  0.661   1.02
6 2005-01-10   1.04   0.615   1.69    2.48 0.346       0.509  0.630   1.01

My code for the same is as follows

ggplot(data=data_vol3, aes(x=index, y=data_vol3$usa)+
  geom_line())

Any help in this regard will be highly appreciated

With regards,
Upananda Pani

I'm only seeing six dates, by the look of them five at one day intervals 
and the last three days later.? According to my calendar those were 
weekdays in 2005.? I don't see much "volatility" there and that's not a 
term I'm familiar with, I suspect it's econometric.? I don't know what 
you're looking for and I think we're starting to get into issues about 
interpretation of data not issues about using R so off list.? I think 
you need statistical or econometric support from somewhere.

Good luck!

Chris

I know it doesn't feel a very sympathetic piece of advice, but I think you need to spend some days working on your understanding of R, ggplot and the tidyverse realm of R.  You can use ggplot() without using much of the tidyverse but they are designed to complement each other and the more I understand of the tidyverse way of doing things, the better I use ggplot().

Dear all,?
I am trying to plot the following table in stacked barplot in percentages and also horizontal.
Component? ? ? Sample 1? ? ? Sample 2? ? ?

When I tried the following functionbarplot(data,

+         sub = "Subtitle",
+         xlab = "X-lab",
+         ylab = "Y-lab",
+         axes = TRUE, horiz = TRUE)
I got the following error
Error in barplot.default(hellisheidi, main = "Stacked bar chart", sub = "Subtitle",  : 
  'height' must be a vector or a matrix
I also tried barplot(as.matrix(hellisheidi)) but what I was getting was the three stacked columns for Samples 1, 2 and 3 but I was getting an empty column for Component, instead of being the variable in the Samples. 


I was hoping if you could help me on that. 
Thank you very much in advance. 
Kind regards,Maria

Dear Richard,?

Thank you very much for your reply. I went through the code and it worked. I was also able to change the colours.?

I was wondering if I can change the legend position; instead of being in the bottom to be on the left side.?

I tried the following but without any success

strip = FALSE
strip.right = TRUE

likert(t(hellisheidi), ReferenceZero=.5, xlab="X-lab", ylab="Y-lab", main="Stacked bar chart", col=c("#E94E1B", "#F7AA4E", "#BEBEBE", "#6193CE", "#00508C", "#E94E1B", "#BEBEBE"), legend.position="left")

Once again, thank you very much.

Kind regards,
Maria

likert is built on the lattice barchart function.
Hence everything in
?panel.barchart
?xyplot
applies.  The legend is constructed with the auto.key argument.

You can move the legend to the left, but that is not a good idea for a horizontal barchart.

likert(t(hellisheidi), ReferenceZero=.5,
        xlab="X-lab", ylab="Y-lab", main="stacked bar chart",
        auto.key=list(space="left", columns=1))

Note that the legend is vertical and the plot is horizontal, making it difficult
to read both simultaneously.

Subject: [R] Question about implementing statistical test in R
Message-ID: <CAJXJZ4Z6n575vkxymNBWvdVNfrGb=i7jfJ2aWDp9=6d2YFQn1g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am a new user and have a stats question that I need help implementing in
R.

I have 4 groups and I want to assess whether there is a statistical
difference between these groups at baseline first in a global comparison
test and then a pairwise comparison test.

There are about 2 continuous variables and 10 categorical variables

For the group wise comparison for continuous variables-I am using the Mann
Whitney test

For the categorical variables-I am using either chi square or Fisher
exact test for both global comparison and pairwise comparison.

What packages should I use to implement this in R? Is there any example
code that I use? I was thinking tbl_summary but don't think that's the
right one.

Would really appreciate any help with this!

Thank you!

Start with defining your dependent variable and independent variable(s). As an equation like y equals some function of x, the y is the dependent variable. It is often continuous, but does not have to be.

If your continuous variable is the dependent variable and you have one categorical independent variable then the ANOVA would be a general comparison tests determining if there are differences. This can be further broken down by a multiple comparison test. The Tukey test is commonly used if you assume normal distributions. The Kruskal-Wallis test would be the start of a non-parametric approach.

Subject: [R] question about update()
Message-ID: <545716BA-05C4-4C53-92BC-40B23555AF69@stat.unipd.it>

Hi. There must be something about the use of update() which I do not grasp,
as the next exercise indicates.

Suppose that obj is an object returned by a call to lm() or glm().
Next, a new variable xf is constructed using the same dataframe used 
for producing obj. Then

obj$data <- cbind(obj$data, xf=xf)
new.obj <- update(obj, . ~ . + xf) 

generates

Error in eval(predvars, data, env) : object 'xf' not found

Could somebody explain what I got wrong, and how to fix it?

Best regards,

Adelchi Azzalini

Thanks, Duncan. What you indicate is surely the ideal route. Unfortunately, in my case this is not feasible, because the construction of xf and the update call are within an iterative procedure where xf is changed at each iteration, so that the steps 

obj$data <- cbind(obj$data, xf=xf)
new.obj <- update(obj, . ~ . + xf)
 
must be repeated hundreds of times, each with a different xf.

Sorry, that doesn't make sense.

You didn't show us complete code, but presumably it's preceded by 
something like this:

   obj <- glm( ..., data = somedata)

So change your modification to this:

   somedata$xf <- xf

That can be done hundreds of times.  This will need to be more elaborate 
if the function doing the iteration has a copy of obj but doesn't have a 
copy of somedata, but there are lots of ways to resolve that.  Without 
seeing complete code, I can't recommend which one to use.

If memory serves correctly, update() takes the object that is passed to
it, looks at what the call was that created that object, modifies that
call according to the additional arguments, and finally executes the
modified call.

So there is a lot of manipulations going on in update().  In particular
it would result each time in a call to lm(), glm() or whatever call was
used to create the object.  Inside any of these modelling functions a
lot of symbolic manipulations/calculations are needed too (parsing the
formula, creating the design matrix and response vector from the parsed
formula and data frame, checking if weights are used &c).

If you do the same calculation essentially over and over again, just
with minor modification, all these symbolic manipulations are just time
consuming.

IMHO, you will be better off to bypass update() and just use lm.fit()
(for which lm() is a nice front-end) and glm.fit() (for which glm() is a
nice front-end), or whatever routine does the grunt work of fitting the
model to the data in your application (hopefully, the package creator
used a set up of XXX.fit() to fit the model, called by XXX() that does
all the fancy formula handling).

Cheers,

	Berwin

Hi, Berwin, good to hear from you, and thanks for the detailed comments and suggestion.

Actually, my current experimental code works in the way that you suggest, calling directly lm.fit and glm.fit.  What I am trying to develop is an ?improved? version of the code for distribution to other people. Hence I wanted to streamline the code, in particular avoiding branches for each fitting procedure (lm.fit, glm.fit and possibly more).  But I am now considering to drop the idea of the ?improved? version, and stick to the direct calls to the fitting functions.

Duncan, thanks for your additional comments. It is true that my original message presented a very simplified picture of the problem, possibly over-simplistic.  If I present the problem in the full version of the code, it would look quite long and messy. If I manage to construct a reasonably simplified version of the code, I shall post the question again.

Best wishes,

Adelchi

Subject: [R] Regex Split?
Message-ID: <7b1cdbe7-0086-24b4-9da6-369296eadfdc@syonic.eu>

Dear R-Users,

I tried the following 3 Regex expressions in R 4.3:
strsplit("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", " |(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])", perl=T)
# "a"??? "bc"?? ","??? "def"? ","??? ""???? "adef" ","??? "," "gh"

strsplit("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", " |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])", perl=T)
# "a"??? "bc"?? ","??? "def"? ","??? ""???? "adef" ","??? "," "gh"

strsplit("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", " |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?=[^ ])", perl=T)
# "a"??? "bc"?? ","??? "def"? ","??? ""???? "adef" ","??? "," "gh"


Is this correct?


I feel that:
- none should return (after "def"): ",", "";
- the first one could also return "", "," (but probably not; not fully 
sure about this);


Sincerely,


Leonard

Message-ID: <dedac47f-7bcf-ca27-4df6-1ee7027aa10d@yandex.com>

Hi

I can't get rgl working. I installed rgl, loaded it, but it seems all 
plot3d codes have failed:

remotes::install_github("dmurdoch/rgl")
library(rgl)
open3d()
x <- sort(rnorm(1000))
y <- rnorm(1000)
z <- rnorm(1000) + atan2(x, y)
plot3d(x, y, z, col = rainbow(1000))

I see no plotting at all. Am I missing some important system library or 
whatever? I'm using Linux Mint 23. Thanks!

Thanks,
Jiayue

If you install the version from CRAN, do you get the same results?

rgl needs X11 on your system.  Do other programs using it work, e.g. try 
running "glxgears" at the terminal, and try running 
"tcltk::tktoplevel()" in R.

BTW, this list isn't for contributed package support, so if it turns out 
that only rgl is failing, it may be best to move the discussion to 
https://github.com/dmurdoch/rgl/issues .

Perl seems to return the results you expect:

$ perl -E '
 say("$_:\n ", join " ", map qq["$_"], split $_, q[a bc,def, adef ,,gh])
 for (
  qr[ |(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])],
  qr[ |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])],
  qr[ |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?=[^ ])]
)'
(?^u: |(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])):
 "a" "bc" "," "def" "," "adef" "," "," "gh"
(?^u: |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])):
 "a" "bc" "," "def" "," "adef" "," "," "gh"
(?^u: |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?=[^ ])):
 "a" "bc" "," "def" "," "adef" "," "," "gh"

The same thing happens when I ask R to replace the separators instead
of splitting by them:

sapply(setNames(nm = c(
 " |(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])",
 " |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])",
 " |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?=[^ ])")
), gsub, '[]', "a bc,def, adef ,,gh", perl = TRUE)
#               |(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])         |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ]) 
# "a[]bc[],[]def[],[]adef[],[],[]gh" "a[]bc[],[]def[],[]adef[],[],[]gh" 
#        |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?=[^ ]) 
# "a[]bc[],[]def[],[]adef[],[],[]gh" 

I think that something strange happens when the delimeter pattern
matches more than once in the same place:

gsub(
 '(?=<--)|(?<=-->)', '[]', 'split here --><-- split here',
 perl = TRUE
)
# [1] "split here -->[]<-- split here"

(Both Perl's split() and s///g agree with R's gsub() here, although I
would have accepted "split here -->[][]<-- split here" too.)

On the other hand, the following doesn't look right:

strsplit(
 'split here --><-- split here', '(?=<--)|(?<=-->)',
 perl = TRUE
)
# [[1]]
# [1] "split here -->" "<"              "-- split here"

The "<" is definitely not followed by "<--", and the rightmost "--" is
definitely not preceded by "-->".

Perhaps strsplit() incorrectly advances the match position after one
match?

If you only want the character strings, this seems a little simpler:

[[1]]
[1] "a"    "bc"   "def"  "adef" "gh"  


If you need delimeters (the commas) you could then add them back in again afterwards.

But no window opens for tcltk::tktoplevel()?  Sounds like R isn't seeing 
your DISPLAY variable.  Does Sys.getenv("DISPLAY") show the same thing 
in R as you see when printing that environment variable (using e.g. 
`echo $DISPLAY`) in the terminal?

Oh yes, a window did open for tcltk::tktoplevel(), I forgot to mention 
it, sorry.
With Sys.getenv("DISPLAY"), I got

In that case, it sounds like it's purely an rgl issue, but I don't 
really have anything else to suggest about how to fix it.  There is a 
workaround:  Run the `rglwidget()` function whenever you want to see a 
plot, and it should open in your browser.

https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16745 (from 2016, still labelled
'UNCONFIRMED") contains some other examples of strsplit misbehaving when
using 0-length perl look-behinds.  E.g.,

> strsplit(split="[[:<:]]", "One, two; three!", perl=TRUE)[[1]]
 [1] "O"  "n"  "e"  ", " "t"  "w"  "o"  "; " "t"  "h"  "r"  "e"  "e"  "!"
> gsub(pattern="[[:<:]]", "#", "One, two; three!", perl=TRUE)
[1] "#One, #two; #three!"

The bug report includes the comment

It may be possible that strsplit is not using the startoffset argument
to pcre_exec

  pcre/pcre/doc/html/pcreapi.html
    A non-zero starting offset is useful when searching for another match
    in the same subject by calling pcre_exec() again after a previous
    success. Setting startoffset differs from just passing over a
    shortened string and setting PCRE_NOTBOL in the case of a pattern that
    begins with any kind of lookbehind.

or it could be something else.

Thank you, Bill -- yes, uhmm, ... a bit embarrassing.

I've finally changed the R bugzilla report's state to "CONFIRMED" now,
and also added the "HELPWANTED" keyword.
I think we (R Core) should be sorry to have (forgotten / not
cared about) the issue completely.

It's not hard to at least agree that the current behavior is buggy,
e.g., in the example you show here :

    >> strsplit(split="[[:<:]]", "One, two; three!", perl=TRUE)[[1]]
    > [1] "O"  "n"  "e"  ", " "t"  "w"  "o"  "; " "t"  "h"  "r"  "e"  "e"  "!"
    >> gsub(pattern="[[:<:]]", "#", "One, two; three!", perl=TRUE)
    > [1] "#One, #two; #three!"

[...]
[...]

Maybe this should be continued either on Bugzilla (i.e., the URL above),
or if needed, additionally  on R-devel.

Yes, I also added that we'd grateful for (tested) patches and/or
code reviewers.

Martin

Dear Bill,


Indeed, there are other cases as well - as documented.


Various Regex sites give the warning to avoid the legacy syntax 
"[[:<:]]", so this is the alternative syntax:
strsplit(split="\\b(?=\\w)", "One, two; three!", perl=TRUE)
# "O"? "n"? "e"? ", " "t"? "w"? "o"? "; " "t"? "h"? "r"? "e"? "e" "!"

gsub("\\b(?=\\w)", "#", "One, two; three!", perl=TRUE)
# "#One, #two; #three!"


Sincerely,


Leonard

Leonard,

It can be helpful to spell out your intent in English or some of us have to go back to the documentation to remember what some of the operators do.

Your text being searched seems to be an example of items between comas with an optional space after some commas and in one case, nothing between commas.

So what is your goal for the example, and in general? You mention a bit unclearly at the end some of what you expect and I think it would be clearer if you also showed exactly the output you would want.

I saw some other replies that addressed what you wanted and am going to reply in another direction.

Why do things the hard way using things like lookahead or look behind? Would several steps get you the result way more clearly?

For the sake of argument, you either want what reading in a CSV file would supply, or something else. Since you are not simply splitting on commas, it sounds like something else. But what exactly else? Something as simple as this on just a comma produces results including empty strings and embedded leading or trailing spaces:

strsplit("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", ",")
[[1]]
[1] "a bc"   "def"    " adef " ""       "gh"  

That can of course be handled by, for example, trimming the result after unlisting the odd way strsplit returns results:

library("stringr") 
str_squish(unlist(strsplit("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", ",")))

[1] "a bc" "def"  "adef" ""     "gh"  

Now do you want the empty string to be something else, such as an NA? That can be done too with another step.

And a completely different variant can be used to read in your one-line CSV as text using standard overkill tools:

> read.table(text="a bc,def, adef ,,gh", sep=",")
    V1  V2     V3 V4 V5
1 a bc def  adef  NA gh

The above is a vector of texts. But if you simply want to reassemble your initial string cleaned up a bit, you can use paste to put back commas, as in a variation of the earlier example:

> paste(str_squish(unlist(strsplit("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", ","))), collapse=",")
[1] "a bc,def,adef,,gh"

So my question is whether using advanced methods is really necessary for your case, or even particularly efficient. If efficiency matters, often, it is better to use tools without regular expressions such as paste0() when they meet your needs.

Of course, unless I know what you are actually trying to do, my remarks may be not useful.

I tried the following 3 Regex expressions in R 4.3:
strsplit("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", " |(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])", perl=T)
# "a"    "bc"   ","    "def"  ","    ""     "adef" ","    "," "gh"

strsplit("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", " |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])", perl=T)
# "a"    "bc"   ","    "def"  ","    ""     "adef" ","    "," "gh"

strsplit("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", " |(?<! )(?=,)|(?<=,)(?=[^ ])", perl=T)
# "a"    "bc"   ","    "def"  ","    ""     "adef" ","    "," "gh"


Is this correct?


I feel that:
- none should return (after "def"): ",", "";
- the first one could also return "", "," (but probably not; not fully 
sure about this);


Sincerely,


Leonard

Dear Avi,

Punctuation marks are used in various NLP language models. Preserving 
the "," is therefore useful in such scenarios and Regex are useful to 
accomplish this (especially if you have sufficient experience with such 
expressions).

I observed only an odd behaviour using strsplit: the example string is 
constructed; but it is always wise to test a Regex expression against 
various scenarios. It is usually hard to predict what special cases will 
occur in a specific corpus.

strsplit("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", " |(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])", perl=T)
# "a"? "bc"? ","? "def"? ","? ""? "adef"? ","? ","? "gh"

stringi::stri_split("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", regex=" |(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])")
# "a"??? "bc"?? ","??? "def"? ","??? "adef"? ""???? ","??? "," "gh"

stringi::stri_split("a bc,def, adef ,,gh", regex=" |(?<! 
)(?=,)|(?<=,)(?![ ])")
# "a"??? "bc"?? ","??? "def"? ","??? "adef"? ","??? ","??? "gh"

# Expected:
# "a"? "bc" ? ","? "def" ? ","? "adef"? "," ? ","? "gh"
# see 2nd instance of stringi::stri_split


Sincerely,


Leonard

Primarily for my own amusement, here is a way to do what I think you wanted
without look-aheads/behinds

strsplit(gsub("([[:punct:]])"," \\1 ","a bc,def, adef,x; ,,gh"), " +")
[[1]]
 [1] "a"    "bc"   ","    "def"  ","    "adef" ","    "x"    ";"
[10] ","    ","    "gh"

I certainly would *not* claim that it is in any way superior to anything
that has already been suggested -- indeed, probably the contrary. But it's
simple (as am I).

Cheers,
Bert

Dear Bert,

Thank you for the suggestion. Indeed, there are various solutions and 
workarounds. However, there is still a bug in strsplit.

2.) gsub
I would try to avoid gsub on a Wikipedia-sized corpus: using strsplit 
directly should be far more efficient.

3.) Punctuation marks
Abbreviations and "word1-word2" may be a problem:
gsub("(?<ThePunct>[[:punct:]])", "\\1 ", "A.B.C.", perl=T)
# "A. B. C. "

I do not yet have an intuition if the spaces in "A. B. C. " would 
adversely affect the language model. But this goes off-topic.

Sincerely,

Leonard
