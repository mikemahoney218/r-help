Greetings,

I've been using R (on Linux i686) for some time now and have been able to accomplish a great deal of work with it. My special regards
go to all who helped to develop it and turn it into an impressive statistical package.
Keep up the good work.

A couple things involving NAs:

1. 

> y _ data.frame(x1=1:10,x2=0)
> y
   x1 x2
1   1  0
2   2  0
3   3  0
4   4  0
5   5  0
6   6  0
7   7  0
8   8  0
9   9  0
10 10  0
> y _ data.frame(x1=1:10,x2="0")
Error: arguments imply differing number of rows: 10, 1
> y _ data.frame(x1=1:10,x2=NA)
Error: arguments imply differing number of rows: 10, 1

Is this considered consistent behavior?

2.
> mean(c(NA),na.rm=T)
[1] NaN

I'd prefer an NA instead of an NaN (which should be reserved for 1/0).

Start R and type 

help(SHLIB)

(note: there's no C in SHLIB). This won't work in Windows, but neither
will "R SHLIB"...

We were interested in doing non-linear optimization in R and have tried
the function nlm.  The manual says that this function uses a Newton type
algorithm.  We are interested in more information about this specific
algorithm and if alternatives (e.g., quasi-Newton) exist in R?  Thanks

Subject: R-beta: Splus -> R migration issues
Message-ID: <3.0.5.32.19980828182723.007acaa0@pop-server.hawaii.rr.com>

I've recently installed R for RH5.0 Linux and been considering moving
existing work from Splus (Windows, 4.5). Also installed the win95 R, but
this doesn't seem to work as well, and in any case the idea is to move
toward Linux.

1 I attach and detach directories freely and often in Splus. Is it
anticipated that it will be possible to do this in R in the future?

2 The ascii representation of Splus objects produced by dump() seems not to
be readable by R load(). What prospect for interoperatiblity in the future?
I note the limited facility of save() and load() at this point, but
vectors, two dimensional arrays and functions would suit my needs.

There used to be a paperback book (412 pages!)
 by
	Alan Lee (University of Auckland,NZ)
	(C) 1994, 1995
called
	DATA ANALYSIS
	An introduction based on R

	[Course notes for U.of Auckalnd Papers 528.281/288]

However, this was based on a (MacIntosh) version of R
	from *before* there were version numbers in R
		(i.e., e.g., no lm(), no data.frames,..)

It is more than just ``learning R'':
As the title suggests, it is also a textbook about basic statistics.
Most importantly: I don't think it is still produced, but I might be wrong
however, in any case, it wasn't freely available.

>>  I don't seem to be able to get it directly off the CRAN www page
(see above)
>> and I am proposing to use R for undergraduate teaching next term

Very good!

Now, what are the alternatives? --- this is also a question to everyone!

1) On CRAN's top page, klicking "Documentation" you find
 
	"Notes on R: A Programming environment for Data Analysis and Graphics"
	 (~90 pages) as postscript file or LaTeX sources.

   which unfortunately, is rather dated  (Fall 1997).

   An updated (but still not really "current") version of it
   is currently available
   from
	ftp://ftp.stat.math.ethz.ch/Software/R/RNotes.tar.gz

   (You need Latex for this):

	mkdir RNotes
	cd    RNotes
	zcat ..../RNotes.tar.gz | tar xf -
	make

2) ??? -- who of you  R users has some basic introduction into using R?

3) For ``more than undergraduate'' students,
   there's  Venables & Ripley's "MASS" (2nd ed., 1997)
   with the online `` Complements on `R' ''

	ftp://ftp.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/R/VR2R.{pdf,ps.gz}

   (these probably will also be available on CRAN,
    as soon as Fritz Leisch returns home ..)

The next (0.63) version of R will have the same as S, here (I think).

Yes.
Brian Ripley's  aov  package which should also make it's way into R 0.63,
has  model.tables()  which provides even more than dummy.coef..

Any volunteers (maybe after 0.63) for doing

	C()		[maybe not so easy]
	dummy.coef	[should be easy/trivial, if you have model.tables]

         ^^^^^^^^^^
	well, well..

	This is true if you look at the ``low-level'' structure of returned
	objects.
	However, the ``normal user interface'' is VERY compatible
	Also, many of the accessor functions  
		[coef(), resid(), effects(), summary(), predict()]
	return the same thing or something very close to S's.

Wrong...You've become too used to seeing R print the factor levels:

> rep(factor(1:3), 2) 
[1] 1 2 3 1 2 3
> dput(rep(factor(1:3), 2))
structure(.Data = c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3), .Label = c("1", "2", "3"),

This got into 0.62.3 already, I think:

> glm.D93$contrasts
 
$outcome
[1] "contr.treatment"

$treatment
[1] "contr.treatment"

The dump() format can be read by source().  The only disadvantage of this
is that using dump/source on large objects is very very slow, so if you
have only a few large two-dimensional objects it's quicker to use write()
and read.table().

Subject: R-beta: ld problem/SunOS/gcc/g77
Message-ID: <9808141729.AA05527@tajo.UCSD.EDU>


In trying to compile R-0.62.2 on my SPARC SunOS: 

tajo% uname -a
SunOS tajo 4.1.3_U1 1 sun4m

with gcc/g77,

I ran into 

gcc  -o R.binary [deleted] ../lib/libmath.a  -L/usr/openwin/lib -lX11  -ldl -ltermcap -lm -lf2c
collect2: ld returned 2 exit status
ld: /lib/libm.a(lgamma.o): _gamma: multiply defined
ld: /lib/libm.a(lgamma.o): _lgamma: multiply defined
*** Error code 1
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `R.binary'
Current working directory /usr/local/RHOME/R-0.62.2/src/main
[rest deleted]

which I assume is due to some 'collision' of the various libraries supplied by R, gcc, g77, and Sun.

I'm not very strong in sorting these things out and would appreciate
some guidance on what to change, what to check, where to look etc.

FWIW it returned the above message when I did nothing but issue
./configure and make, issued ./configure --with-g77, and when I did
the following in config.site:

.
.
.
 R_PAPERSIZE=letter
CC=gcc
FC=g77
LDCMD=gcc
LIBS=-lf2c
.
.
.

TIA,

Well, gamma and lgamma are indeed found in both -lm and in libmath.a,
but that usually doesn't bother the linker. Is there anything peculiar
about your setup, such as perhaps a very old gcc?

One "quick hack" you could try is to put the definition

at the top of the file ~R/src/include.

I haven't tried this myself.  It is just a guess as to what might

	Once again, I foolishly attempted a major port of S, ratfor, and
	Fortran code (hidden Markov models from an article in the latest Can
	Jr Stat) to R without access to S-Plus itself. Here are some problems
	I found before abandoning:

	1. replicating a factor does not give a factor:
	  is.factor(rep(gl(2,1,2),2)) is FALSE

I have just implemented this.  It will show up in the development version
momentarily.

	2. sample() does not have the option, prob=

This is a good little exercise for someone :-).  Anyone want to write a
C function which does this.  I.e. we want a function which takes a
vector of probabilities and returns the sampled values.  We probably
want with and without replacement.  Given such a function it would be
about two minutes work to integrate it into R.

	3. glm()$assign does not exist
	4. glm()$contrast is very different from S - apparently the latter is
	  a list with one member per variable instead of a copy of the options
	  in effect
	5. C() does not exist (something to do with contrasts, which are
	  apparently handled much differently in S-Plus)

I have had the contrasts stuff on my todo list for a while.  Expect
(more) compatibility soon.

	6. dummy.coef() does not exist
	7. something else I have now forgotten...

	In general, almost all aspects of model fitting in the two seem
	to be completely incompatible.

We try to be moderately clean-room.  To get particular details right
we need a clear description of what is needed.

	Ross


PS: Splus (= S Version 4) for Linux is imminent (At least Bell Labs
has delivered it to MathSoft).  You might want to look into it.

Thanks to Peter Dalgaard and Ross Ihaka for their responses (already

Following Ross' suggestion, I added the two #defines near the top of 
	
	~R/src/include/Mathlib.h

The compilation ran to completion, and I am now using R-0.62.2

It's a bug alright. Ross said that he fixed it for the development
version, but perhaps we should get it fixed already for 0.62.3 (due
out "soon").

Look at my port of the boot package on CRAN, in zzz.R. One day
I will internalize this for efficiency.

But the structure of assign is very different between S and R,
and of course is undocumented under R. In retrospect it would have
been more efficient to alter R to be compatible before trying to
write aov. But to do that I would have had to know what the differences
were ....

It is in 0.62.3 now. But there are some incompatibilities at this level,
as in S the contrasts are numeric and in R they can be functions.
I believe all the internal code copes with this, but user-written 
code might not. This is an attempt to be backwards compatible with
both R and S.

It does not exist, but as of 0.62.3 the differences in handling are minor.

Actually, dummy.coef in its full glory is not at all easy, as far as I can
see.  These are used rarely, and there is always (so far)  another,
cleaner, way to do it (for C used contrasts<-: that does now work
compatibly).  It seems dummy.coef may not be in future versions of S. 


As someone who has spent far too many hours trying to port S(-PLUS) code to
R, I am not at all surprised. I am also not sympathetic. If you have S-PLUS
code and your time has value (Jim's must: look at all those books), go buy
a copy of S-PLUS (and a machine if necessary) to run it on. The point for
me at least of porting code to R is purely altruistic: it makes it more
widely available, particularly to the student community (or it will when
the Windows versions of R catch up).

Subject: R-beta: Bug tracking system
Message-ID: <x2yasoajuj.fsf@biostat.ku.dk>


I'm happy to announce that there is now a real bug tracking system for
R.

Hopefully, this will make it easier for us to keep track of unresolved
bugs, which has been difficult because of the massive amount of email
that we receive.

The system, which is of the JitterBug variety is available through the
web at

http://r-bugs.biostat.ku.dk

or via email to

r-bugs at biostat.ku.dk (which is aliased to r-bugs at stat.math.ethz.ch for
the absent-minded...)

There are no particular formatting requirements for reports, although
the web interface tries to help you remember to give information on
your R version, OS, etc.

The web interface also allows you to browse through old reports to see
whether your problem has already been reported by someone else.

The members of the core team are automatically notified when new
reports come in. You will not necessarily receive any response to a
bug report, other than perhaps that the next version of R will have
one bug less.

Note that this is intended to help us get rid of bugs in R, not as a
general helpdesk service. For problems in using and installing R, the
mailing lists should still be preferred.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.02.9808180025460.910-100000@gamma.fuzzy.at>

Hi,

I do not want to send only error messages from the DEC Alpha port of R, so
here is a success message:

I got R working with Digitals DXML (=digital extended math library,
which replaces BLAS functions)

The following patch generates a new configure script which accepts a
"--enable-dxml" option, to be used instead of "--enable-blas".

Now it first searches for -ldxml befor searching for -lblas, so it should
work on other platforms too.

It seems to work: I tested it with the chol() function, which in turn
calls "ddot" as one of the blas functions.

How do you save your own function/data?  I am using Win95/NT version, upon exiting

Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.3.96.980818162351.19729A-100000@biosta.mskcc.org>

I am trying to compile R on my Debian 2.0 machine.  I have both gcc and
egcc (required for g77).  Since the configure script doesn't check for
egcc I used CC=egcc (even used LDCMD=egcc) in the config.site file.
Everything worked fine until the final binary where it tries to use gcc

  .......
  egcc -g -I../include -c unique.c
  egcc -g -I../include -c util.c
  egcc -g -I../include -c version.c
  gcc -export-dynamic -o R.binary arithmetic.o array.o attrib.o bind.o
  builtin.o character.o coerce.o colors.o complex.o context.o cov.o cum.o
  .......
  ld: cannot open -lf2c: No such file or directory

and exits with the above error (it works if I go to the src/main directory 
and execute the above with egcc instead).  How can I make the configure 
and make scripts to use egcc throughout?

Something similar happens to me when g77 is not found and I get f2c instead. You
might check which fortran compiler is found (somewhere in the output from
./configure). I had to put a link f77 -> g77 somewhere near the beginning of my
path. The libf2c shouldn't be needed if you are using g77.

The move has taken place because they have been expanded to include

Well, as Debian contains an R package (which is usually very up-to-date,
thanks to Doug Bates), you can simply use the 'meta-makefile' debian/rules to
build the package.  As you already have an original R tarball, just get the
matching Debian diff.gz file, ie 'r-base_0.62.2-1.diff.gz' (note that Debian
renamed R to r-base for interbal consistency), apply this diff.gz to the
tar.gz for 0.62.2, change into the directory and say

	$ debian/rules build 

which will do the work.  Reading the Makefile debian/rules should be
straightforward. 

Hope this helps,  Dirk

Message-ID: <35DC07B7.4E85A9E4@ozemail.com.au>

"This is a good little exercise for someone :-)"

I had the chance to rework some of the functions I have used for various
testing and stats programs, plus adding a few new bits.  As far as I can
tell, this more or less replicates the S-PLUS 'sample' function.  I
wrote and compiled it on Linux v2.0.31 using gcc v2.7.2.3.

As I am still not entirely clear on the data types used in R, there are
probably some alterations necessary to allow it to be used.  Please let
me know what is needed, as I have a bit of spare time at the moment. 
Also, the 'main' and 'PrintVec' routines are only for demonstration of
the functionality, and would be chopped out for actual use.

I have no idea why, but I suggest that if the author has placed
that restriction on the code in his official web page it should
be respected, irrespective of what more lenient restrictions may
appear on other, older versions elsewhere, such as in statlib.

Moreover I have to say that, while there is a lot of clever and
interesting stuff in the Hmisc and Design libraries, I think R
is, on balance, better off without them.  They re-define so many
fundamental method functions in S that it almost becomes like
dealing with another system.  My personal view is that it is a
better policy to work with the base system as the designers
intended, flaws and all, rather than to change the fundamentals,
after which the objects you create and and code you write only
work in this altered environment.

I hasten to add that this is merely a difference of opinion
between Frank and me.  I grearly admire the work Frank has done
for the S community and I applaud his generosity in making it so
freely available.  We currently are, and I sincerely hope we
remain on friendly terms.

Thanks for all those who sent me email regarding the error message I got
when I tried to compile R on a Debian 2.0 system (which is a glibc2 based
linux distribution -- Prof Ripley: I apologize for not providing more of
the details in my query.)  Debian systems let you have both gcc and the
egcs version egcc in the system.  By providing the appropriate path in the
config.site for LIBS (thanks to Doug Bates) I was able to compile the code
correctly.

Once again thanks.

That is my view too, although privately I have suggested to M Dreau that he
approach Dr Harrell to see if he would also object to the porting of
earlier versions. 

As to why, I can only give my own reaction. My early reactions were to
consider seriously stopping anyone else porting my code to R.  The reasons
are to do with support. S-PLUS users of my code seem to feel it is my
responsibility to provide technical support, my fault if the answers given
by the software are not what they expect, and that I should debug their
brain-damaged installations, as well of course as read the documentation
for them. Of course, this is only some users, but complaints outnumber
plaudits by a large margin, and contributions of enhancements by even more. 
Worse (and I know this also annoys Dr Harrell) people post complaints to
lists before giving the author a chance to respond.

In the end our (Bill V. and I) decision was to port our code to R ourselves
(even though I at least use R for no other purpose), but I would have a
great deal of sympathy for a software author who wanted to limit his
exposure to support requests, especially on a platform he did not use.

I tried to port parts of the Hmisc-package about 2 months ago and
informed Frank Harrell about my intentions, but he didn't allow the
port giving the following reason:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Andreas,

I realize that some of the functions will port correctly,
but I don't want to be in the position of answering questions
from R users when I don't use R myself.  That's why I'm
declining to allow any of the functions to be used in R.

Then, he changed the copyright notice...

As soon as Mike Meyer can get to it, I've asked him to make
some minor changes in the S archive so that I can make it clear
that permission for porting the Hmisc and Design libraries to R is 
denied.  I don't have anything against R personally as a subset 
of S-PLUS.  I just have only so much time and I don't want to spend
any of it helping R users when I have no plans to install R myself.
Also, the Hmisc library is highly fluid, so any port of Hmisc to R
would have to freeze it at some point in time.
I learned recently that Design has been ported to R.  But Design
requires the Hmisc library to work fully, and permission to port
Hmisc to R has been denied for a while now.

This is a personal decision so please don't start a thread about
this in s-news or send me any E-mail discussing this.  Thanks for
your consideration.  I have no financial relationship with MathSoft
by the way.

I understand why F. Harrell decided this way & I respect this. But
there is a serious
problem with it : when most people who contribute s-code don't allow a
porting to R, R would lose much. I know that S-Plus is in many aspects
more developed than R but R has at least two advantages about S:

(1) It is GNU software. The Gnu concept implies the advantage that the
source is open to suggestions. That makes Linux, Emacs etc. so usefull,
stable ... & successful. Many user can comment/help at the stage of
developing/testing. 

(2) R is free software. I work in social science, that often
means: difficult methological questions and no money. Because of
this fact I think the future for R is not as bad. 

Well, F. Harrell don't want a discussion on this topic in any
mailing-list. But  there can be a generall discussion on
porting software.
Perhaps Harrell libraries arn't good examples for such a  discussion,
because the main changes in that libraries (beside the fact, that several
stat. concepts are implemented) is that S-plus concepts are changed, for
example the storing the data in objects created by stat. procedures. 

Perhaps it's useful to remain the authorship of Splus-software by the
orignal author and to move the resonsiblity to the one who ported the
code to R.

P.Malewski

Btw: if the use of source is resticted, i think it isn't gnu software any
more.

I was getting some strange results adding two matrices
together, when I eventually worked out that one of them
was a data frame (they both look the same when you print
them!). I was surprised to discover the following behaviour:

1) When a matrix is added to a data frame, they do not
have to conform. In fact the matrix is treated like a vector.

2) When a vector is added to a data frame, there is no check
to see if the number of rows in the data frame is a multiple
of the vector length.

Even more surprisingly, this is exactly the same as the
behaviour of S-PLUS. Bug or feature?

Frank

Having a fairly large library (about 20,000 lines) of S code myself, I have a
great deal of sympathy with your concern about additional support demands. I
would like to pass along some comments about my experience, and hope this may be
of use and may influence your position.

I have been relatively careful about the design of my library and in large part
have avoided the use of Splus special features. This was a design decision. I
did not like the idea that my investment depended on a proprietary product which
may change and force costly changes on me. (It is almost impossible to stick
with old unsupported versions of Splus. Eventually, operating system upgrades
will force a change.) I have been burned fairly badly by 2 of 4 Splus upgrades
that I have gone through, and am dreading the next one. When I started
developing in Splus one of the reasons I choose it was that I though S was
available and a similar backup was not available for other alternatives (such as
Matlab and Gauss). R has returned us to that more secure position. In the U.S. I
believe the government has a regulation requiring code developed for the
government  be done with languages available from more than one supplier. I
understand it is largely ignored, but the regulation does make a lot of sense.

Porting my code to R helped me recognize a few instances where I relied
unnecessarily on Splus extras. Now that I have completed the port there are only
a few instances where I rely on Splus, for some non critical things which I do
not use very often. I have separate "make" procedures for Splus and R, but one
set of source code and test procedures. So far I have not found that ongoing
support is a problem.

More importantly, certain kinds of error checking are better (or at least
different) in R than in Splus. This has pointed out a few errors which were not
caught in Splus. Also, the fact that I get the same results from Splus and R
gives me considerably more confidence about the soundness of the system.

In situations were I am forced to use "For" loops in Splus I find it much more
expedient to develop and debug in R, then go to fortran or For loops in Splus.

I use Unix, and for me supporting R and Splus has been much, much easier than
trying to help people who want to use my code under Splus for Windows. I say
"trying", because basically I cannot help them. I don't have Splus for Windows,
I don't have any of the necessary compilers, and I'm not really interested in
spending the time. I have relied on others to supply compiled code and explain
the installation procedures. I have found that users are very understanding when
I reply that I can't help them. I think if you are serious about protecting your
own time then you should consider preventing people from using your code under
Windows or Unix, whichever one you don't use. Not that I am suggesting that you
do that, but I think you would save yourself much more time than by prohibiting
its use in R.

Apologies: Prof Ripley was kind enough to point out that my code was
seriously broken in sampling without replacement.  In tracing this, I
actually ran the S-PLUS examples and found that they didn't work as
advertised in the manuals.  That is, one _doesn't_ get a vector
completed with NAs when the number of samples is greater than the
population with non-replacement.  I have fixed this, but still have to
crack the problem of returning static empty strings as the 'character'
analogy to NAs.  Also, I would like to track down the more efficient
algorithms that were suggested.

Subject: R-beta: design && hmisc && CRAN
Message-ID: <199808231420.QAA16334@pc87.maho.magnaeu.com>

On Fri, 14 Nov 1997, Jim Lindsey <jlindsey at luc.ac.be> sent an email to
r-devel describing his first shot at porting Design and Hmisc to R.  A
few days later, his port snapshot of Design was uploaded to CRAN's
src/contrib/devel area, and has since been available from there.

A few weeks ago, Andreas Weingessel <A.Weingessel at ci.tuwien.ac.at> had a
look into porting Hmisc to R (we needed some code for imputation).  When
he checked with the author, he was not given permission to ``port'' the
code.  (I guess everyone interested has meanwhile had a look at the most
recent version of the Hmisc copyright.)  As, on the other hand, Jim's
port was made from a version of Design which was obtained from Statlib
and had been released under the GPL, CRAN went on carrying the port.

We will now remove this port, so that within a few days it should have
disappeared from all CRAN sites.  Maintainers of CRAN mirror sites, pls
check.  We will do this mostly as there seems to be no point in having
an (even incomplete) R version of outdated S(-PLUS) code.

I would also like to support Bill Venable's advice NOT to try building R
versions of the packages from scratch.  In the past, porting code has
not only helped in increasing R's computational power, but also in
getting us substantially closer to the plain S (v3) standard.  With a
little effort (and we remember Paul Gilbert saying that it is worth it
anyway) one can have S packages which work under various S-PLUS versions
and R.  Several key developers are now providing R ``versions'' of their
code themselves.

What I am trying to say is that in the future, the R community should
spend time devoted to ``porting'' code wisely.  One criterion is whether
the author of the original code is willing to incorporate compatibility
changes if necessary and in the future ``maintain'' compatibility
through defensive programming.  Another is whether the software is
really needed under R.  Altogether, it might be better to come up with
entirely new solutions.

Subject: R-beta: Segmentation fault

Dear everyone,

I'm doing some simulations which involves bootstrapping
(using functions written in c loaded with R's dyn.load()
function) and maximising the likelihood function with R's
nlm() function. I used to run my code in S-plus but because
I frequently ran out of memory (because of S-plus' silly
memory management), I decided to try porting my code to R. 
In R (on a linux platform), everything seems to work
smoothly (no memory buildup according to gc() ), except that
I, every now and then, get the error message "Segmentation
fault - core dumped".  I haven't quite figured out which
part of my code is generating the problem; the error
actually seems to pop up at different places in my code
depending on the exact history of the R-session - which I
find very strange.  Also, if run exactly the same sequence
of commands in two separate R-sessions, R terminates at
exactly the same point.  This led me to believe that my
code somehow generates an illegal data set just before the
error occurs.  However, if I write each bootstrap replicate
to a file and, and then reload the data in a new R-session
and refit the model, no error shows up.

Could it possibly it is something going on inside R which is
causing the problem?  Or that I have a hardware problem??

These crashes usually happen due to a weakness in the R memory
management model: If you look in almost any source file, you'll see a
lot of PROTECT()...UNPROTECT() constructions, which are there to
protect temporary objects from garbage collection. If one forgets one
of those, nothing bad happens, *until* GC is triggered at exactly the
wrong moment. Human nature being what it is, a handful of such errors
have slipped in, and a new one pops up from time to time.

Although the bugs can still be elusive, they can be spotted using a
debugger, once one has a set of data that is known to generate the
crash.

As far as I know you can just do
image()
contour()
for 3D plots.  Apparently persp() is in the works.

Subject: R-beta: R-0.62.3 is released
Message-ID: <x2btp55oan.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>

I have just put R-0.62.3.tgz and R-0.62.2-0.62.3.diff.gz into the FTP
area at Auckland. As usual, do not fetch it from there unless
absolutely urgent, because of the NZ Internet billing system. The
files should get mirrored to the main CRAN site in Vienna tonight and
the rest of CRAN within days.

[And, may I add, the NZ connection is slower than a sloth in a tarpit.
I had turnaround times of up to at least 15s while packaging the
release!]

This is a patch release, mainly fixing bugs, but with a few new
features too.

Most likely, this will be the last of the 0.62 series, 0.63 is getting
pretty stable now.

Here's the top of the CHANGES file:


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.62.3

NEW FEATURES

    o   preserve factor levels and contrast settings in model objects

    o   factor[...,drop=T] reduces level set

    o   added dblepr, intpr

    o   do_modelmatrix(model.c): Set rownames from data argument.

    o   New generic function preplot().

    o	A new R BATCH interface for non-interactive execution.

    o   Added `offline' argument to help() for producing hardcopy via
	latex and dvips.

    o   glm.fit.null now calculates AIC and print.glm.null prints it

    o   effects.lm implemented

    o   new class "mlm" for multivariate "lm", predict.mlm to go with it

BUG FIXES

    o   biplot[.default]() was redundant in "base" package; now only in "mva".

    o	unix(..) now helps the user to find  system(..) instead.

    o   apropos("[") and methods("[") now both work (even though "[" is not
	a valid regular expression).

    o   row.names<-.default now exists. Converts object to data
        frame and then adds row names

    o	codes() now distinguishes between ordered and unordered factors

    o	codes() had *opposite* semantics of Splus. Now it's the same.

    o   replicating factors now yields factors (again)

    o   print.summary.xxx  functions more consistent, using new function
	print.coefmat().

    o   Changed many `T' to `TRUE'  and  `F' to `FALSE' in the base package.

    o   binary operation on 1x1 matrix lost dimension

    o   fix anova.glm for null model

    o   glm.fit.null: ensure df.residual == df.null for a null model

    o   summary.glm: correlations in saturated cases

    o   stat.anova: use match.arg and labeled switch statement

    o   Major cleanup of glm iteration code

    o   Correct reordering of glm coefficients if pivoting

    o   Rownames on contrast matrices

    o   factor() and [.factor preserves class "ordered"

    o   Code rearrangement in predict.lm (avoid unnecessary computation)
        + let rownames through on predictions

    o   model.matrix.default: Initial code to define model frame
        simplified considerably after defaulting data argument to
        sys.frame(sys.parent()).  This also removes the problem where
        data.frame mangles I(x^2) and similar names, so that the
        "reorder" sanity check at the end fails.

    o	The handling of extra FORTRAN libraries (f2c-related and BLAS)
	should now be correct.  Via SHLIBLDFLAGS, add-ons will also be
	linked against these libraries.

Subject: R-beta: repeated measures GLM binomial data?
Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.3.95.980828094624.26898B-100000@io.uwinnipeg.ca>

I don't know much about GLM in general or glm in R. Can anyone tell  me
how to do the following (in R or some other stat system) or refer me to a
textbook discussion?

Two factor ANOVA repeated measures design.
Each subject gives a percent correct.

I am assuming the correct way to proceed is to fit a generalized linear
model with binomial responses and logistic link. But I have not found a
detailed discussion of this in either McCullagh & Nelder or Dobson.

Here is a toy example. Each datum is proportion correct out of 100
trials for one subject:
        b1      b2
a1      .5,.6   .1,.2
a2      .7,.8   .2,.3
a3      .8,.9   .3,.4
(2 subjects)

How does the analysis proceed?  Thanks very much for any help.

Bill Simpson

Can you please be more specific why you can't read the file? Which
reader to you use? What is the error message? ...

I just tried and have no problems reading the file with either
ghostview or gv (running under Linux). Did you realize that the file
is gzip-ed?

Works OK from here. Are you aware that it is gzip-compressed (.gz) and
needs to be uncompressed?

Message-ID: <35E6F0B9.E1E6783C@mail1.stofanet.dk>

Dear friend. I think it can be done using a generalized liniear mixed model -
implemented for instance in genstat:

read Y
.5 .6 .1 .2
.7 .8 .2 .3
.8 .9 .3 .4 :
units[nval=12]
factor [lev=3] a
factor [lev=2] b
factor [lev=2] sub
generate a,b,sub
print a,b,sub,Y

glmm[distrib=bin;random=sub;fixed=a*b] Y;nbin=100
vplot
vdisplay[print=wald]

This produces totally plausible output to the toy example.
A reference could be to Breslow and Clayton, ASA 88: 9 ff 1993
hope this could help-
Troels

I am using R in my teaching, a problem in print graph 
REALLY drives me crazy. 

I am using rjune.zip version. On my NT box it prints beautifully
both the graph and the Consel. (just click the print in the menu).
(that why I decide to use R in my class.....)

My student install it on Win95, R print out the consel with
no problem. But when printing a graph, it says "an error occur".
Same problem on my home PC with Win95 and a laserJet.

My guess is that postscript driver is needed for the printing of
graph, so I installed Ghostscript on the Win95 PC, but still have 
the same problem. 

My students cannot turn in any assignment unless I can tell them
how to print graph.....Please help.

Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <199808311040.MAA18844@benes.incoma.cz>

Dear all,
I have some problems running the R (June 1998) on PC/Win95:
- like the others, I am unable to print graphs (non-postscript LaserJet)
- I have some problem with hclust - the function returns the error message:

Error in .Fortran("hclust", n = as.integer(n), len = as.integer(len),  : C/Fortran 
function not in load table

The principal components, for example, work well.
Perhaps I am not loading the mva library properly?
Any hints?
Thanks for response!

R-June seems to be quite a bit unstable. I crashed it twice in 5
minutes on Win95 while playing with the new menus, and there have been
reports on not getting it to run at all on (some!) NT systems.

I think a better bet is Guido's port of R-0.61.3.

Personally, I'm split between upgrading to Guido's version or take
another semester with good ol' warts-n-all RSept. (Or pound like mad
at getting a version of 0.62.3 to work with the mingw32 compiler, but
my time seems to be sifting right through my fingers these days and I
haven't really got a clue about Win32 API programming.)

I ugraded my system and apparently my mailqueue had the above note in
it, which sendmail decided to deliver about 2 months after it was
written...

Subject: R-beta: Legend again !
Message-ID: <35EAB288.431EC94D@ipimar.pt>

Hi, again !

I'm trying to add a legend to a group of graphs I have in one page
(using: par(mfrow=c(4,2))). The legend must be in one part of the page
so that it can be used to all graphs but when I try the lines type (lty)
disapears and only the plotting symbols still be there.

Why ?

the command I'm using is:

legend(3,160,leg.txt,text.width=2.8,cex=.6,lty=c(1,2,0),xjust=1,pch=c(0,0,1))

thanks

ernesto

For what its worth, I certainly agree.  I have not found Guido's port to
crash once.  Also, with Mingw installed its not too difficult to get
dll's working etc.  There isn't a history mechanism yet, but that may be
available with his next port, which apparently is due soon.
