This question is probably off-topic.
Which may explain why no one else has answered.

I think what you are trying to do, is contrary to the way that GAMs (and
regression generally) are designed to work.
I'd recommend that you use one approach or the other (PCA or GAMs, but not
both) unless you really know what you're doing...
And even if you do know what you're doing, the resulting model would be
difficult to interpret.

Are the reports in plain text format?
Are there specific key words to search for?
Are the reports in a certain order?
If so, this makes things easier.

Would grep work?
This can be called from the command line, or within R, or both.
Note that there are many grep-based functions within R.
(grep, grepl, agrep, agrepl, and many more...)

There is also a CRAN Task View, for this sort of thing:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/NaturalLanguageProcessing.html

However, 100 reports isn't that many.
It may take longer to find (or create) suitable tools than go through 100
reports manually.

Subject: [R] sd in aggregate and help.search/?? seem not to work as usual in
 latest version
Message-ID: <003e01d52ff1$18c03090$4a4091b0$@maki-science.org>

Hello dear helpers,

I am currently running a small R-crash course for beginners at my
university, since I believe that there a far too few lectures about how to
use R.

Thereby, I showed the '??' or 'help.search()' function to the students as
well as the 'aggregate()' function with 'FUN=sd'.

 

The code worked fine for me - as usual (in version 3.5.1) - but not for the
students. Doing some research got me to the point, that in the current
version (3.6.0),

'aggregate' cannot use 'sd' for data.frames with mixed columns of factors
and numeric columns and throws an error (which is somewhat ok, since 'var()'
is not applicable for factors, of course)  instead of putting 'NA's into the
respective columns like it does with 'FUN=mean' and like it does in the
former version(s). 

Is this a bug or a feature? It would be nice to work with it, the way I am
used to. Of course it is not difficult to work around this problem, but it
is somewhat strange, why it was changed that way (if this was intended).

 

Additionally, the 'help.search()' always just gives the result: "No results
found", for all of my students.

 

I didn't find any post about that issues so far, so I am not sure whether
this are known issues (but all of my 10 students had this problem).

 

If this were intended changes, I would be interested, what the reason is and
whether there are direct workarounds (e.g. instead of using only numeric
columns), for those issues. 

Otherwise I am looking forward to a fixed version. 

 

Thanks in advance for your help!

 

Kind regards,

Subject: [R] Using rms Package's Predict function with transformed variables

Hello,

I would like to use the rms Package's Glm and Predict functions in
order to use some of the additional details that they provide. I'm
struggling to get them to work in cases where the formula contains
multiple transformed versions of the same variable however. For
example Y ~ x + x^2 + log(x+1).

I have tried to do a fair bit of experimentation and research on this,
but closest I have found is a stackoverflow question for which no
complete answer was ever posted
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42168371/rms-package-glm-how-to-add-indicators-in-the-formula).
As the post indicated, it's possible to do the fit by creating
explicit transformed variables, but then I can't come up with a way to
get them to vary together correctly when using the Predict function.

Any help would be appreciated
---
Marc Burgess

Example code:

# Generate test data:
library(rms)

set.seed(100)

testdata <- rnorm(10000, 50, 10)
ltestdata <- log(testdata+1)
testdata2 <- testdata^2

yvals <- rpois(10000, 10+ltestdata+testdata+testdata2)

# Can fit using standard glm as follows:
testfit1 <- glm(yvals ~ I(log(testdata+1)) + testdata + I(testdata^2),
family=poisson())

# Trying different methods fail for rms Glm that don't work:
ddist = datadist(testdata, ltestdata, testdata2)
options(datadist="ddist")
testfit2 <- Glm(yvals ~ I(log(testdata+1)) + testdata + I(testdata^2),
family=poisson())
testfit3 <- Glm(yvals ~ asis(log(testdata+1)) + testdata +
asis(testdata^2), family=poisson())
testfit3 <- Glm(yvals ~ asis(log(testdata+1)) + pol(testdata,2),
family=poisson())

# It does work to use the explicit transformed variables:
testfit4 <- Glm(yvals ~ ltestdata + testdata +  testdata2, family=poisson())

# We can't then use Predict with testfit4 because it doesn't make
sense to independently vary the 3 predictors
plot(Predict(testfit4, testdata=30:50, fun="exp")) # ltestdata and
testdata2 are being held constant
plot(Predict(testfit4, testdata=30:50, ltestdata=log(30:50+1),
fun="exp")) # Creates predictions for all combinations, most of which
are impossible.

I opened the csv file in excel and I tried to make a new csv (delimited)
file. I dont know why in the "save as type" box Unicode text (*.txt) is
written. Why the format is txt while the file extension is .CSV?
Please help me to read this format correctly.
Many thanks.

Hi Javad,
Unicode characters do have embedded nulls. Try this:

d4<-read.table("./4.csv",sep=";",header=TRUE,encoding="UTF-8")

Can't offer much help, especially in respect of the first issue 
involving aggregate(). (But it sounds to me more like a bug than a feature.)

I would just like to point out that when I do

     help.search()

(with no argument) I get:

> Error in help.search() : do not know what to search

This seems reasonable, apart from being ungrammatical.

If I do, e.g.,

    help.search("ellipse")

I get a brazillion results.

This is with version 3.6.0.

Hi Marvin,
One way to get around the problem with "sd" is to only process those
columns of a data frame for which the variance is defined. It is an
opportunity to show students how  to write wrapper functions as well:

sd_num<-function(x) return(ifelse(is.numeric(x),sd(x),NA))
df<-data.frame(group=rep(0:1,each=5),value=1:10,name=LETTERS[1:10])
aggregate(df[,2:3],by=df[1],FUN="sd_num")

Those students are probably using RStudio.  This appears to be an 
incompatibility in the RStudio browser to a nearly unannounced (as far 
as I can see) change in the help system.  You can read about the change 
in the comments around line 700 of

https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/utils/R/help.search.R

Perhaps if anyone from RStudio is reading this, they can read those 
comments and fix things in their front end.

To work around it, students can set

options(browser="/path/to/their/browser")

where that path will depend on what system they're using.  On MacOS, 
options(browser="/usr/bin/open") works.  On Windows, 
options(browser=NULL) works.  I don't know the R default on Linux.

This will cause lots of things to appear in an external browser instead 
of in the RStudio display, so it's not the nicest workaround, but at 
least it's fairly easy.

I just saw here:

https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/4819

that the issue is known and fixed in RStudio, but still only in a 
preview release available here:

Firstly, I recommend against naming your file "1.csv".
(Start with a letter not a number).

Secondly, a CSV file should be separated by commas not semicolons.
You can specify sep=",", however, it's probably easier to use the
read.csv() function.

Note that you should be able to open your file in a text editor to see the
separators.

> I dont know why in the "save as type" box Unicode text (*.txt)

Other posters have suggested that you need to specify the encoding.
Assuming that you create your CSV file correctly in Excel, I doubt that
this is necessary, but I could be wrong...

Your comment suggests that you have saved your document as "Unicode text".
You need to tell Excel to save the file as a CSV file.
(There should be a list of save options).

Simply typing a file name with a .csv file extension is unlikely to produce
the desired result.

Subject: [R] placement of plot in rgl
Message-ID: <000701d53074$78d237c0$6a76a740$@bigpond.com>

Dear All

I rarely use the excellent rgl package but have sometimes run into a problem
with placement of the plot within the window.
Up to now I have avoided having to find a solution.

I was going through the series of posts from 
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2019-June/463014.html  
when I came across
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2019-June/463057.html
where the plot starts in the bottom left corner as a results when moving it
parts of the plot get obscured.

Is there a way around this; forceClipregion and  getr3dDefaults() to me seem
a little sparse on details.
I tried using xyz.coords but no improvement

Code is as follows:

Don't be so US-centric, Abby... how do you know that javad's version of Excel doesn't default to using semicolons?

Subject: [R] cancerclass,

Message-ID: <CAJSpfoxx2aX-kBOsxvJ1HG2Sdt+MFQfrgnvLB=MqPTkp_NVhhA@mail.gmail.com>

 Hi All,

This is the first time I use 'cancerclass' package in R. It works pretty
well.
However, I can't find out which genes are used in the predictor model and
how these genes are combined together to build the predictor model.

Thanks in advance.

I don't.

However, Comma-Separated Values (CSV) are, comma separated, by definition.
So, if the files use semicolons, then...

Also, the use of the wrong sep="my.delim" argument is the most likely cause
of single column output.

However, you're right, I don't really know, I'm just guessing...

If I recall correctly, Excel's 'Unicode' used to mean "UTF-16", which R's
scan() did not recognize without a hint.  The relevant argument is
fileEncoding, not encoding.  UTF-16 files generally have lots of null bytes
and UTF-8 files have no null bytes and if you try to read UTF-16 as UTF-8
you get the embedded-null warning.

I don't have Excel installed, but the following example is from R-3.5.2 on
a Linux box.

> f8 <- file(tf8 <- tempfile(), open="w", encoding="UTF-8")
> cat("\u0416;zh\n", file=f8); close(f8)
> readBin(tf8, what="raw", n=file.size(tf8))

Subject: [R] read.xls without row number, column numbers, or factors
Message-ID: <20190701201334.Horde.vmgnih8Vwo5wzDvqHUeHUiN@www.mathnmaps.com>

Is there a way to use read.xls to copy a portion of a single row of an  
XLS spreadsheet to a list, without getting assigning row and column  
numbers, and, if the data consists of strings, without assigning levels?

Or alternatively, to take the single-row data frame generated by  
read.xls and convert it to a list, without row numbers, column  
numbers, or levels.

Right now I'm using version 3.2.3, on Linux Mint 18.  Can certainly  
upgrade if this would be desirable.


thanks for any assistance

Hi Javad,

I could not make sense of the data structure associated with the csv
file as it is copied in your previous message. Would you mind sending a
link so one can download your csv file directly (or at least the
first few lines) so people can check the exact properties of your file?

Yours.
Olivier.

Subject: [R] Conditional Logistic Regression with Multilevel Data [using
 clogistic() in Epi and lmer() in lme4???]
Message-ID: <DM6PR06MB6346B1076D8C57D958290274A4F80@DM6PR06MB6346.namprd06.prod.outlook.com>

I need to run some conditional logistic regression models on a multilevel matched dataset (propensity score matched data from multiple research sites).


I can pretty easily use the clogistic() function in the Epi package to run conditional logistic regression models on each separate/nested subset of the data (e.g., data obtained from each research site separately). However, I cannot figure out how to run an aggregate analysis (of all aggregated sites) in a way that accounts for clustering.


When using unconditional logistic regression I can run the aggregate analysis lmer() function in the lme4 package. However, I cannot figure out how to run conditional logistic regression with the lmer() function (I am also open to any other packages/functions that might work).


Thanks in advance for help with this.

Message-ID: <CAOcmn_iK8LrJ-GwPGUgpzXaHf2u_14wDtcRdvKK3uApwE5VrHg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have a blocking and nested design.
I have Season (3 levels; three different collection periods). That's my
Block.
I have three Populations that I sampled from (Plant material)
>From each population, I sampled 30 trees.
Each Tree is either Female or Male or Unidentified (Sex factor) and
Each tree is either Juvenile or Mature or Old (Maturity factor)

Maturity factor and Sex factor is not balanced within the population.

So, Population is nested within Sex and Maturity

I measure a chemical from the leaves of those trees with the name of PAC.

Is the way that I write the code correct?
lm (PAC ~  Season + Population+ Sex/Population + Maturity/Population)

Thanks a lot,

Eleftheria

No, it isn't correct I'm afraid. From what you describe, Population
isn't nested within Sex or Maturity.  Population 1 can contain both
male and female trees, as well as trees of different ages.

A simpler model would be

lm (PAC ~  Season + Population + Sex + Maturity)

So that Sex and Maturity have the same effect in each population. If
you think their effects vary between populations, then you would want

lm (PAC ~  Season + Population*Sex + Population*Maturity)

which is the same as lm (PAC ~  Season + Population*(Sex + Maturity)).

If you mean the read.xls function from gdata package, it uses read.csv
to read the temporary CSV file produced from the XLS file and passes its
arguments using ..., so it should be possible to pass as.is = TRUE and
prevent factors from appearing.

It doesn't seem to be possible to prevent row and column names from
being produced (except passing header = F if your CSV doesn't have a
header).

The readxl[*] package offers somewhat saner defaults, so you might want
to try that, too.

Converting a one-row data frame to a list is not difficult, but there
are several ways to represent the data as a list. Here is a
possibility:

> dta <- data.frame(t(LETTERS[1:10]), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

  X1 X2 X3 X4 X5 X6 X7 X8 X9 X10
1  A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I   J

Subject: [R] Matrix - remove [,1] from top row
Message-ID: <CAO4oC1k-QkRdcs5+8_q4f-PhAPR722Op1PUmUg8=E4xrOYoLEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am simply trying to remove the [,1] row from a matrix.  I tried to
search Google to see if I could find how that is removed, but could
not find a way to do it.

So I have the following:

                [,1]
date          2019-7-01
Peeps       5
days         7
worn          9

this is what I want:

date          2019-7-01
Peeps       5
days         7
worn          9

Any ideas?

Nic

Hello,

That is not a row, what you seem to have is an object of class  
"matrix" and when it's printed it prints the column names or [,1]   
[,2] etc if there aren't any colnames. So your matrix has just one  
column and 4 rows with rownames 'date', 'Peeps', 'days', 'worn'.


Hope this helps,

give your a matrix an empty column name.

Colleagues,
Can anyone suggest a package or code which might help me calculate the minimum sample size required to estimate the population variance? I can do this in Minitab but I'd rather do this in R.

I'm not familiar with this topic.
For the benefit of those of us (like me), who are not experts on
conditional logistic regression, what does the above statement mean?

Hopefully, someone who is more familiar with this topic, can help you more.

A search does not seem to yield specific examples that are relevant.

That being said, it might be worthwhile posting to r-sig-mixed-models:

  https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-mixed-models

where experts in the domain of multi-level models reside.

There may be an approach using glmer() or an alternative package, where you can define the paired observations within sites in manner that makes sense for the clustering of data at the site level.

Marc Schwartz

Message-ID: <1769103982.2113708.1562138119053.JavaMail.zimbra@cognigencorp.com>

Hi, 

The within function can be used to modify data.frames (among other objects). One can even provide multiple expressions to modify the data.frame by more than one expression. However, when new variables are created, they seem to be inserted in the data.frame in the opposite order they were declared: 

> df <- data.frame(a=1) 
> within(df, {b<-a*2; c<-b*3})
  a c b
1 1 6 2 

Is there a way to insert the variables in an order consistent with the order of declaration (ie, a, b, c)? 

Thanks 

Sebastien

Dear Heather,

You can do this with clogit() from the 'survival' package, using strata(). See:

http://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/tips:clogit_paired_binary_data

You can also use lme4::glmer(), glmmML::glmmML(), or metafor::rma.glmm() for that. [1]

[1] Rerunning this example, I noticed a slight issue with the structuring of the output from rma.glmm() -- if you want to run that example, install the 'devel' version of metafor as described here:

https://wviechtb.github.io/metafor/#installation

Best,
Wolfgang

I need to run some conditional logistic regression models on a multilevel matched dataset (propensity score matched data from multiple research sites).

I can pretty easily use the clogistic() function in the Epi package to run conditional logistic regression models on each separate/nested subset of the data (e.g., data obtained from each research site separately). However, I cannot figure out how to run an aggregate analysis (of all aggregated sites) in a way that accounts for clustering.

When using unconditional logistic regression I can run the aggregate analysis lmer() function in the lme4 package. However, I cannot figure out how to run conditional logistic regression with the lmer() function (I am also open to any other packages/functions that might work).

Thanks in advance for help with this.

Wolfgang,

Perhaps I am missing something here, but with clogit(), or Heather's initial attempt at using clogistic(), as both have 'strata' arguments, wouldn't the 'strata' argument need to be able to accept a nested structure, along the lines of strata(id / site)?

On the page that you link to below, I don't see an example of that type of nesting structure.

The mixed effects models would generally support a nested random effects specification, if that makes sense here.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

One way is to use mutate() from the dplyr package.

Hi Sebastien,

Your 'within' command returns a dataframe. So without changing the call to
within you have some options such as:

df2 <- within(df, {b<-a*2; c<-b*3})
df2[c("a","b","c")]

OR

within(df, {b<-a*2; c<-b*3})[c("a","b","c")]

OR

within(df, {b<-a*2; c<-b*3})[c(1,3,2)]

HTH,
Eric

I have found using `with` to create one column at a time to be more clear than using `within` when sticking with base R, though I don't see why `within` couldn't be repaired to behave more like `mutate`.

Why not set all the new columns to dummy values to get the order you
want and then set them to their final values in the order that works
for that?

Hi Marc and Wolfgang,


Thanks for your help. Is the following interpretation of your exchange correct?


I need to use the glmer() function in the lme4 package (first installing the devel version of metaphor). I can specify both site and matched pairing as random effects using (1 | site / id).


Is this understanding correct?


Thanks,


Heather

Hi Heather,

I would defer to the mixed models experts, but I think that the basic approach using nested random effects seems to make sense.

I don?t know that there is a dependency of glmer()/lme4 on metafor for this specific use case, but would defer to Wolfgang on that point.

Regards,

Marc

Dummy columns do have some drawbacks though, if you find yourself working with large data frames. The dummy columns waste memory and time as compared to either reorganizing columns after the `within` or using separate sequential `with` expressions as I previously suggested. I think mutate avoids this overhead also.

The dummy columns waste memory and time as compared to either reorganizing columns after the `within` or using separate sequential `with` expressions as I previously suggested. I think mutate avoids this overhead also.

I think mutate() has only a very small advantage over within().  Neither 
one of them is flexible about the order of columns in the final result. 
In the OPs example, mutate creates the variables in the desired order, 
but it would be no better if the desired order had been a, c, b, because 
b is needed for the calculation of c, so it would be created first.

Eric's suggestion

within(df, {b<-a*2; c<-b*3})[c("a","b","c")]

is the best so far, though I'd probably write it as

within(df, {b<-a*2; c<-b*3})[, c("a","b","c")]

just to avoid confusing my future self and make clear that I'm talking 
about specifying an order for the columns.

And if you really, really want everything to happen within the call, 
just create the variables in the reverse order to what you want, e.g.

within(df, {c <- a; b<-a*2; c<-b*3})

but to me that is a lot less clear than Eric's solution.

No need to install metafor for lme4.

Thanks to both of you! I will try this and if it does not work I will reach out to the multilevel help page that Marc suggested.

No need to install metafor for lme4.

Subject: [R] Reloading old R Environments/Workspaces
Message-ID: <CAPQaxLN=dk1Dn5_JvbhC-HrBd1N91PU7Ga9J+H4P-qjZwfdDLg@mail.gmail.com>

Good evening,

  I tried loading an R global environment that I had saved so to resume my
work on the datasets I manipulated during that particular R session. After
loading the file directly, the same items that were contained in the
original working environment from the previous session appeared to be
successfully implemented in my new environment. I used the ls() command to
ensure that the data I had loaded through my main console was present and
properly formatted (as it appears to be) in the environment.

This is the result...

> ls()
[1] "anno"
[2] "cnames"
[3] "GBM_protein_expression"
[4] "mapper"
[5] "meth"
[6] "protein_expression.LGG.US.(1).tsv"
[7] "stringAsFactors"
[8] "vec"

  I was expecting an object/file name of some sort to appear given that I
had loaded two datasets in this previous R session, manipulating them in a
manner that resulted in the above output. Does this output illustrate that
the data I worked with in the previous R session, with its cosmetic
alterations and all, are all now loaded within this session? In other
words, has my previous work been restored? I wanted to make sure somehow as
I would like to manipulate the data further.

Best,

Spencer

Saving/loading does not affect the status of packages being loaded or not, which may affect how useful those objects are.   This is why I depend on having a script that can reproduce my results at all times, and only use the load/save feature to minimize the number of times I have to re-do long recalculations.

I do have a script available, though it is not in a traditional R script
file/document, but an .Rhistory file as well as on Notepad. Is there a way
I can convert one or both of these file types into an R script file so that
I can run the commands directly to my console?

Best,

Spencer

An R file is nothing more than a text file with an R extension instead of a TXT extension. Use any text editor you like to rearrange your commands in the order you want and remove false starts (beware of Notepad... it seems to have a tendency to tack on a .txt extension in addition to the .R extension of you are not careful).

If you use an R development tool like ESS or RStudio or Notepad++ with the R extension, you can type all of your commands into the file editing window first and you can use a hot key to copy them to your R console. That way you make a file and test your commands as you write them, all at once.

> Dummy columns do have some drawbacks though, if you find yourself working with large data frames. The dummy columns waste memory and time as compared to either reorganizing columns after the `within` or using separate sequential `with` expressions as I previously suggested. I think mutate avoids this overhead also.

I think mutate() has only a very small advantage over within().  Neither 
one of them is flexible about the order of columns in the final result. 
In the OPs example, mutate creates the variables in the desired order, 
but it would be no better if the desired order had been a, c, b, because 
b is needed for the calculation of c, so it would be created first.

Eric's suggestion

within(df, {b<-a*2; c<-b*3})[c("a","b","c")]

is the best so far, though I'd probably write it as

within(df, {b<-a*2; c<-b*3})[, c("a","b","c")]

just to avoid confusing my future self and make clear that I'm talking 
about specifying an order for the columns.

And if you really, really want everything to happen within the call, 
just create the variables in the reverse order to what you want, e.g.

within(df, {c <- a; b<-a*2; c<-b*3})

but to me that is a lot less clear than Eric's solution.

Subject: [R] Package sf, unit for dist in st_buffer
Message-ID: <CAC8=1era2yzZ6m6KBHZDew4WMJ=tnjvs2LhkGkEq4KE+ZgjkrA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

map3 <- st_read("My Shapefile") %>% st_as_sf %>% st_transform(crs = 7755)
# Please see any shapefile here :
https://github.com/datameet/maps/tree/master/Districts

map_buffer <- st_buffer(mapHR, dist = -1000)
# CRS 7755 is for India, please see here, https://epsg.io/7755

My query is : The unit for distance is meters ?
On this page : https://epsg.io/7755,it says unit is metre.

On this page :
https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/sf/versions/0.7-4/topics/geos_unary
it says :
dist numeric; buffer distance for all, or for each of the elements in x; in
case dist is a units object, it should be convertible to arc_degree if x
has geographic coordinates, and to st_crs(x)$units otherwise

I just want to be sure that, I am using a distance of  1 kilo metre ( 1000
metres) . Can someone please confirm ?

Thank you,
Ashim

Don't  know, but ask on r-sig-geo if you don't get a satisfactory reply
here.

Hello again,

  I might be repeating myself here, so my apologies, but do I have to run a
script file from my R Studio to reimplement my previous work for a given
project.... so to start up where I left off.... or is opening up R and,
with my global environment automatically reloading as it was when I last
worked on, sufficient?

Best,

Spencer

Saving your workspace when you quit is a common default, but it is 
generally a bad idea.  Old junk collects in there, and makes new results 
harder to debug.

A better workflow is to never save the whole workspace.  If you have 
just computed some object(s) and the computation took so long you don't 
want to repeat it, then save just a minimum, and load them later in a 
new session.

A particularly dangerous situation happens if you sometimes save your 
workspace and sometimes don't.  You can end up with situations like this:

Session 1:  compute some random values.  Save the workspace, including 
the random number key.

Session 2:  automatically load the saved workspace.  Compute some new 
random values.  Quit without saving the workspace.

Session 3:  automatically load the saved workspace from Session 1, 
including the random number seed.  Any random values computed in this 
session could be identical to the values in Session 2, because they are 
starting with the same seed.

If you don't have a saved workspace to load, you end up with a blank 
slate, and the random number key is generated based on time of day and 
process number, so is almost certainly different in every session. 
(Sometimes you want a repeated seed for reproducibility, but it's always 
bad when you're surprised by one.)

Thank you for the clarification. So should I not rely on importing a saved
environment from now on? I am currently experiencing some difficulties with
reproducing the output (aka the objects listed in my environment), which is
why I was trying to load them all at once.

Best,

Spencer

If you can't reproduce them, how do you know they are correct?

Partly because the procedure itself is incomplete, but yes I see the
illogic nature of my position.

 Thanks for the suggestion but I'm not sure that it answers my original question.I need to know how many samples I need to collect to collect in order to estimate the sample size needed to achieve a specific margin of error for confidence intervals for the population variance. I'm not sure whether the pwr package does that.

(And combining two of Marc's posts).

initial attempt at using clogistic(), as both have 'strata' arguments,
wouldn't the 'strata' argument need to be able to accept a nested

I found the coxme() function from the coxme package.

According to it's documentation:
"Fit a Cox model containing mixed (random and fixed) effects."

I found some sources stating that a Cox model, is equivalent to a
Conditional Logistic Model, in some cases.
And another source that said that you need to set time equal to one, for
every data point.
However, I haven't verified any of this.

I don't know if it's possible to use the coxme() function in conjunction
with Marc's idea for nested random effects...?

This is the relevant part of the NEWS file

CHANGES IN R 3.6.1:

  INSTALLATION on a UNIX-ALIKE:

    * The default detection of the shell variable libNN is overridden
      for derivatives of Debian Linux, some of which have started to
      have a /usr/lib64 directory.  (E.g. Ubuntu 19.04.)  As before, it
      can be specified in config.site.

  UTILITIES:

    * R CMD config knows the values of AR and RANLIB, often set for LTO
      builds.

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

    * The use of a character vector with .Fortran() is formally
      deprecated and gives a non-portability warning.  (It has long
      been strongly discouraged in 'Writing R Extensions'.)

  BUG FIXES:

    * On Windows, GUI package installation via menuInstallPkgs() works
      again, thanks to Len Weil's and Duncan Murdoch's PR#17556.

    * R CMD check on data() fixing PR#17558 thanks to Duncan Murdoch.

    * quasi(*, variance = list(..)) now works more efficiently, and
      should work in all cases fixing PR#17560.  Further, quasi(var =
      mu(1-mu)) and quasi(var = "mu ^ 3") now work, and quasi(variance
      = "log(mu)") now gives a correct error message.

    * Creation of lazy loading database during package installation is
      again robust to Rprofile changing the current working directory
      (PR#17559).

    * boxplot(y ~ f, horizontal=TRUE) now produces correct x- and
      y-labels.

    * rbind.data.frame() allows to keep <NA> levels from factor columns
      (PR#17562) via new option factor.exclude.

      Additionally, it works in one more case with matrix-columns which
      had been reported on 2017-01-16 by Krzysztof Banas.

    * Correct messaging in C++ pragma checks in tools code for R CMD
      check, fixing PR#17566 thanks to Xavier Robin.

    * print()ing and auto-printing no longer differs for functions with
      a user defined print.function, thanks to Bill Dunlap's report.

    * On Windows, writeClipboard(.., format = <n>) now does correctly
      pass format to the underlying C code, thanks to a bug report
      (with patch) by Jenny Bryan.

    * as.data.frame() treats 1D arrays the same as vectors, PR#17570.

    * Improvements in smoothEnds(x, *) working with NAs (towards
      runmed() working in that case, in the next version of R).

    * vcov(glm(<quasi>), dispersion = *) works correctly again, fixing
      PR#17571 thanks to Pavel Krivitsky.

    * R CMD INSTALL of binary packages on Windows now works also with
      per-directory locking.

    * R CMD INSTALL and install.packages() on Windows are now more
      robust against a locked file in an earlier installation of the
      package to be installed.  The default value of option
      install.lock on Windows has been changed to TRUE.

    * On Unix alikes (when readline is active), only expand tilde (~)
      file names starting with a tilde, instead of almost all tildes.

    * In R documentation (*.Rd) files, \item [..] is no longer treated
      specially when rendered in LaTeX and hence pdf, but rather shows
      the brackets in all cases.

Subject: [R] How to create Pivot table in r?
Message-ID: <CAMwU6B0duuJDVbDazunBTrgL9oijtQOfWRJ4YeC9TFdAOD5U4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi R users,
I was trying  to create a pivot table (cross tabulated) by Site1date (rows)
and Site2 date (columns), and spent substantial time but no luck to create
it. Is there any possibility to create it?
I would be very grateful to your help.

"daT1" is row data, in which three columns (speciesID, detected at SiteA,
Site B) and cell has date in which they were detected. From this data, I
wanted to create a table to show a joint detection between site1 and Site2.

I was trying to get the table similar to "daT2", which is a cross tabulated
table by Site1 date (rows), and Site2 date (columns). After that I would
like to see another table related sum of the detecttions in each cell (
"daT3" table)

The example data are given below (daT1) and output tables (daT2, daT3). I
appreciate your help very much.

Sincerely

Subject: [R] Help on MFAmix to Reduce Dimensions for a Genetic Dataset
Message-ID: <BL0PR02MB477289CB6F3816F12EE47905D9FA0@BL0PR02MB4772.namprd02.prod.outlook.com>

Dear R Help Members,


I am a student from Washington University in St. Louis and I am working on a genetic project in R. In this dataset, there are 497 rows and 11,226 columns. Every row is a genetic marker series for a particular hybrid, and every column is a genetic marker with value 1, 0, -1 and NA. I am trying to reduce the dimensions of this dataset because I want to combine this one and other weather datasets for further predictions.


However I encountered two problems after I read the package instructions carefully:

1, For groups and name.groups, I set them as seq(1, ncol(geno)) and colnames(geno) respectively, where geno is the variable name for test_fill. I have attached this dataset for your reference. I am wondering if these settings are correct.


2, Error: There are columns in X.quali where all the categories are identical keeps popping out. Since I do not know much about the genetic dataset and I do not want to remove the columns even if those two columns are identical, what can I do next?


Thank you very much and I look forward to your reply.

Best wishes,

Subject: [R] How to create Pivot table in r?
In-Reply-To: <CAMwU6B0duuJDVbDazunBTrgL9oijtQOfWRJ4YeC9TFdAOD5U4w@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <20190705095712.Horde.xQuiRhZjH6O0_zSHwFGbPxg@mail.sapo.pt>

Hello,

Maybe you want to take a look at function xtabs.

xtabs(~ site2 + site1, daT1)

Note that the results are different if you convert to class "Date" first.

daT1$site1 <- as.Date(daT1$site1, format = "%d-%b-%Y")
daT1$site2 <- as.Date(daT1$site2, format = "%d-%b-%Y")
xtabs(~ site2 + site1, daT1)


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

You could consider the case of 50% power, though that'd not be exact for asymmetry.

But if this is a simple univariate data set, it sounds like messing around with chi-squared quantiles and uniroot ought to work. Exactly how are you calculating your confidence limits and which one (upper or lower) needs to be of a specific size?

Please read the Posting Guide (again?).

1) Most attachments are stripped by the mailing list. Yours was. It is far more practical to embed a small subset of data in the email as the output of dput() than to attach files.

2) This is the R-help mailing list, but your question has no R code in it. That is a strong indicator that it may be off-topic. Another is that you seem to be asking how to use a specialized contributed package (PCAmixdata? you did not say...) rather than about the R programming language. (Would you ask for help on nuclear physics in an English class?)

Just from your description I suspect you may need to familiarize yourself with factors and what they are used for in R. Both the genetic markers and groups vectors may be candidates to be factors, though I know nearly nothing about genetic data analysis so that could be incorrect.

Also (possibly incorrect as I don't know about this package) the use of unique values (seq) in an input named "groups" seems  counter to the typical usage of such a vector. Have you read the vignette [1]? It does not use unique values for groups.

As for your error... remove them if the analysis won't support leaving them in. You may be able to re-introduce them later, but really, if you are reducing dimensionality then aren't constant values the most obvious candidates for reduction?

Subject: [R] How to set scale of color scatterplot points relative to a
 third variable?
Message-ID: <44B428DB-030E-4C0D-A4AE-8D0AF44A22E4@nih.gov>

Hello Kind and Generous Volunteers,

I'm trying to use a scatter plot to visualize three variables: time, radius, and intensity. I would like each point on the scatterplot to be colored according to a gradient, in which red indicates an intensity less than 1, white indicates an intensity of 1, and green indicates an intensity more than 1.

```
#A1 scatter plot

colors <- c("firebrick2", "white", "darkolivegreen3")
class <- classIntervals(A1.matrix[,3], 10) #A1.matrix[,3] is "Intensity"
colorcode <- findColours(class, colors)
plot(A1.matrix[,1], A1.matrix[,2]) #A1.matrix[,1] is "Time" and A1.matrix[,2] is "Radius"
points(A1.matrix[,1], A1.matrix[,2], pch = 19, col = colorcode)

```

It is very close to what I am looking for. Firebrick2 and darkolivegreen3 correspond to the minimum and maximum values in A1.matrix[,3] respectively. But white does not correspond to 1. How can I set white equal to 1?


Ideally, the graph would also have a color bar scale to show what the min and max values are. I?ve read that findColours returns two attributes for use in constructing a legend, but I haven?t been able to find much more information than that.

I've had success doing something similar with a levelplot heatmap, using at=unique as shown below. However, I just copied that from somewhere online and it doesn't seem to work in the points function, I can?t find it using help() or google, and I'm not sure how it works or if it could somehow be applied. The colorbar scale is automatically part of the graph with levelplot.

```
#A1 heat map

levelplot(nbin.A1, cuts = 50, at= unique(c(seq(A1min,1, length = 100), seq(1,A1max, length=100))), col.regions = colorRampPalette(c("firebrick2", "white", "darkolivegreen3"))(1e3), xlab = "Radius (Microns)", ylab = "Time")

```

Thank you for reading! Your volunteer work is SO appreciated!!

Best,
Sarah Flaherty

Hi Rui,
Thank you very much for the code. It is great as it gave the number of
individuals encountered in each cell but- is it possible to see which
individuals were in that cell?
for example - site2 (2015-05-02) and site2(2015-03-31) has value 2, is it
possible to show these two  "941FD","8737SP" IDs in that cell? It must be
hard to create this type of table.

daT1<-structure(list(ID = structure(c(13L, 11L, 18L, 8L, 12L, 7L, 15L,

2L, 1L, 17L, 16L, 14L, 10L, 9L, 6L, 3L, 5L, 4L), .Label = c("1B82",

"7A1D", "848A8", "8737SP", "87E6E", "941FD", "942C", "9C39",

"9D10B", "A1271", "A253", "A451", "C27A", "C767D", "CBA8", "CDF10",

"D5DB", "FB3E"), class = "factor"), site1 = structure(c(3L, 1L,

2L, 3L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 3L, 2L, 3L, 3L, 2L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L

), .Label = c("3-Mar-2015", "30-Mar-2015", "31-Mar-2015"), class = "factor"
),

    site2 = structure(c(1L, 3L, 1L, 1L, 6L, 1L, 6L, 1L, 2L, 5L,

    5L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 4L, 1L, 1L, 4L), .Label = c("", "14-Apr-2015",

    "17-Apr-2015", "2-May-2015", "22-Apr-2015", "9-Mar-2015"), class =
"factor")), .Names = c("ID",

"site1", "site2"), class = "data.frame", row.names = c(NA, -18L

))


daT1$site1 <- as.Date(daT1$site1, format = "%d-%b-%Y")

daT1$site2 <- as.Date(daT1$site2, format = "%d-%b-%Y")

AA<-xtabs(~ site2 + site1, daT1)

AA


Once again, I am very grateful to you.

Thanks

Wolfram Engine for Developers is now free (under some circumstances). Is it
possible to call Wolfram from R, especially from RStudio?

Being able to do this would significantly increase the potential of R, I
believe.

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] Update for R package KScorrect for K-S goodness-of-fit
 tests
Message-ID: <a87f8a21-cd5f-e1b4-1779-23ca4c27e589@ben.edu>

Greetings,

We wanted to announce v. 1.4.0 of the R package 'KScorrect', which 
carries out the Lilliefors correction to the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff (K-S) 
test for use in (one-sample) goodness-of-fit tests.

Aside from several minor changes, the biggest change is that the Monte 
Carlo algorithm now supports parallel implementation, using the 
platform-independent 'doParallel' and 'foreach' infrastructure. For 
complex distributions (such as Weibull, gamma, and mixture of normals), 
running in parallel can significantly reduce computation time.

It's well-established that it inappropriate to use the K-S test when 
sample statistics are used to estimate parameters, which results in 
substantially increased Type-II errors. This warning is mentioned in the 
ks.test Help page, but no general solution is currently available for 
non-normal distributions. The 'KScorrect' package corrects for the bias 
by using Monte Carlo simulation, a solution first recommended by 
Lilliefors (1967) but not widely heeded.

Distribution functions are provided in the package for the loguniform 
and univariate mixture of normal distributions, which are not included 
in the R base installation.

Simple examples are provided by calling example(KScorrect) or example(LcKS).

Additional details are available at 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/KScorrect. Bug reports, 
suggestions, and feature requests are encouraged at 
https://github.com/pnovack-gottshall/KScorrect.

We hope you find the functions useful when conducting goodness-of-fit 
tests using the K-S test.

Sincerely,
Phil Novack-Gottshall and Steve Wang

Hello,

Would the following do it?

agg <- aggregate(as.character(ID) ~ site2 + site1, daT1, paste, sep = ", ")
names(agg)[3] <- "ID"
agg
#?????? site2????? site1??????????? ID
#1 2015-03-09 2015-03-03????????? A451
#2 2015-04-17 2015-03-03????????? A253
#3 2015-03-09 2015-03-30????????? CBA8
#4 2015-04-14 2015-03-30????????? 1B82
#5 2015-04-22 2015-03-31?? D5DB, CDF10
#6 2015-05-02 2015-03-31 941FD, 8737SP

Hope this helps,

Hi Rui and Richard,
Thank you very much for the help. You are very smart and your code saved my
time tremendously.
I added one line and got the results what I was looking for it.

After "agg", I added dcast function


agg <- aggregate(as.character(ID) ~ site2 + site1, daT1, paste, sep = ", ")

names(agg)[3] <- "ID"

agg


agg_wide<- dcast(agg, site2~ site1, value.var="ID")
agg_wide

Even from a cursory glance, it is clear that this product is not Free Software, not even Free as in Beer. It cannot be used by end users of open source projects unless you apply for a special license from Wolfram, which I strongly suspect would render the whole project in violation of the GPL license that R has.

It is possible that you could write an interface from R to WED. The licensing questions around "derived works" are a bit murky, but as far as I know it is OK for a GPL'ed software to _use_ a commercial software, assuming that the user has the appropriate license. However, I fail to see that such an interface would be a major selling point for R.

On a nice summer day in the Fitou region of France, I feel like asking 
all R-help folks to raise a glass of their favorite beverage in a toast 
to the R / CRAN maintainers.

Thanks for your efforts!

I think the Wolfram license is for non-profit, i.e. users and NGOs.
Companies making a profit should buy a license. IMHO, the strategy is to
increase Wolfram user base.

For R and RStudio, it would make sense to add Wolfram to become a
comprehensive solution to do science. R is of course mostly statistical. R
competes very well with Python in the areas R does well. But in anything
not numerical, but symbolic, R lacks a lot. Instead, Python has SymPy and
Sagemath.

So, a scientist may switch from R to Python, due to the combined numerical
and symbolic capabilities.

Instead, if RStudio could use Wolfram, then a scientist would have better
symbolic than Python (or the same, since Jupyter already interfaces
Wolfram), RStudio which is better than Jupyter, better statistics than
Python and better c++ integration than Python.

At least me, I am in this conundrum. With integration to Wolfram, it would
be a no-brainer to remain with R.

Subject: [R] How to set scale of color scatterplot points relative to a
 third variable?

Hi Sarah,
The size_n_color function in the plotrix package does something like
this. To get the colors that you want using "color.scale" in the same
package, look at the help page for that function. The values in
A1.matrix[,3] probably don't range from 0 to 2, so getting exactly
what you want can be a bit tricky with 1=white. If you can post a
representative sample of these values, it should be doable.

I don't get it. I have been quite content to use Maxima when I want symbolic manipulation for many years. I have not felt this pressure you imply that R should do everything, and I have tried both Mathematica and Wolfram Alpha at times and found neither of them so compelling that I felt the slightest bit jealous of people who have licensed access to Wolfram's tools and services.

This satisfaction with an available separate tool may arise from my expectation that symbolic manipulation should occur in the course of developing theoretical foundations for numerical work as a separate stage from the numerical work itself. Having such separation fits the pattern of writing papers and documentation for human consumption separately from implementing algorithms... which isn't the only way to do things but has its benefits. (I have not even felt any incentive to use Ryacas package to interface with Yacas. People looking for some integration with R may find Ryacas fills some of that need, but it is not as feature rich as Maxima. [1])

Of course, none of that proves that there shouldn't be some such capability to interact with WED services... but as always the onus for implementation belongs to those with the itch, and it does look to me like license compatibility will be a constraint. Specifically, R+WED would inevitably carry restrictions that R+Ryacas or Python+SymPy will not.

FWIW I am just a satisfied user of R (and Maxima), and speak only for myself.

Nobody has mentioned Julia. Last year Changcheng Li did a Google Summer of Code project to
add automatic differentiation capability to R. autodiffR package was result, but it is still
"beta". The main awkwardness, as I would guess for Wolfram and other wrappings, is the
non-R side having "updates" so the interface changes slightly but enough to force changes
in the wrapper.

As Jeff points out, those with itch must be the scratchers.

I have a data frame containing two variables: year and rate (shown below).
Which function can I use to plot rate (y-axis) against year (x-axis)?
There will be more columns of rate later on.
Thank you.

year rate 1 1993 0.608 2 1994 0.622 3 1996 0.623 4 1998 0.647 5 2000

Oh come on!

Please do your homework and spend time with some basic R tutorials, one of
which ships with R, although there are tons more good ones on the web.

And FYI, there are *several* different plotting systems that one can access
using various R packages. Probably the most basic -- but still quite
powerful -- uses the function ?plot  !!

Hello,

Please don't post inHTML, the data is unreadable.

As for the question, it is very basic. try any of


plot(rate ~ year, data = df)    # df is your dataframe
plot(df$year, df$rate)


Then read ?plot and ?par to see how to customize the graph, by  
changing the plot type, how to add colors, etc.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Please do not post in html.

You could use ggplot to do this. But you need to do a bit of work yourself.

You mean "... *envious* of people ... "!!! :-)

I once explained the difference between "envious" and "jealous" to my 
wife Victoria, by means of the following parable:

Suppose that you were walking down that the street one day, engaged in 
conversation with our good friend Jeff Newmiller [1] and you chanced to 
look up and catch sight of me, locked in a hot passionate embrace with 
[e.g.] Tessa Thompson.  *You* (Victoria) would be jealous.  Jeff would 
be envious.

cheers,

Rolf

[1] Obviously I used the name of a bloke who is actually in my wife's 
and my circle of acquaintances when I first inflicted this parable upon 
my wife.  Also I am "of course" assuming here that Jeff is heterosexual.

Sad to say, you are far from being alone in your breach of this

Subject: [R] Adding column values based on a condition
Message-ID: <CA+MLcG1M1QcU7kB4RQ2BmgPgAyN7diwwypyShTbsXbNFDBOv9Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all!

I have a tibble regarding a series of comments on a forum; the tibble has a
certain number of variables, and in particular:

id: comment id;
author_id: author id;
parent_id: if the message is a reply, the original comment id

I want to add another column, in which I put the author id of the original
comment, when parent_id IS NOT NA.

I already tried to use mutate + ifelse but my problem is that I have to
refer to an author id in a different row than that in which I'm evaluating
the if condition...

Thanks in advance,
Alessandro

I have a data frame containing two variables: year and rate (shown below).
Which function can I use to plot rate (y-axis) against year (x-axis)?
There will be more columns of rate later on.
Thank you.

Hi Steven,
A basic plot can be displayed like this:

sydf<-read.table(text="year rate
 1993 0.608
 1994 0.622
 1996 0.623
 1998 0.647
 2000 0.646
 2002 0.625
 2004 0.628
 2006 0.685
 2008 0.679
 2010 0.595
 2012 0.567
 2014 0.599
 2016 0.642
 2018 0.685",
header=TRUE)
plot(sydf$year,sydf$rate,type="b",
xlab="Year",ylab="Rate")

When you add more years and rates to the data frame, the axes will
change to include the years and rates outside the ones in your
example. As some have noted, this is a very basic question.

Subject: [R] Curl4, Quantmod, tseries and forecast
Message-ID: <20190707114236.GA1724@masha>

Dear All,
I have just upgraded to Debian stable 10 and rebuilt most of the R
packages.
I use the R backported packages from here

https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian/#debian-buster-testing

for the core system.
I encounter some issues when updating quantmod, tseries and forecast.
For instance, see the following

> install.packages("tseries")

which finally fails with the following message

** byte-compile and prepare package for lazy loading
Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) : 
  unable to load shared object '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/curl/libs/curl.so':
  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcurl.so.4: version `CURL_OPENSSL_3' not found (required by /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/curl/libs/curl.so)
Calls: <Anonymous> ... asNamespace -> loadNamespace -> library.dynam -> dyn.load
Execution halted
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package ?tseries?
* removing ?/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/tseries?
* restoring previous ?/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/tseries?

Now I have curl44 installed on my system because that is what Debian
prrovides me with (and for the overwhelming majority of my packages it
is not a problem).
Please find below my sessionInfo().
Any suggestion is appreciated.
Cheers

Lorenzo

The error is related to the installation/version of cURL on your
system, so I suggest sending this to R-SIG-Debian (cc'd).

Can't this be done more simply and efficiently (no sapply implied loops, no
conditionals) just with indexing?

Using Eric's example:

df <-within(df,
      parent_author_id <- author_id[match(parent_id, id)]
       )

> df
   id author_id parent_id parent_author_id
1 101        25        NA               NA
2 102        24        NA               NA
3 103        23       101               25
4 104        22        NA               NA
5 105        21        NA               NA

Subject: [R] question about redfit from dplR
References: <1363446100.3828666.1562515925178.ref@mail.yahoo.com>
Message-ID: <1363446100.3828666.1562515925178@mail.yahoo.com>

Hi All,
I've been trying to use the redfit function in dplR on an unevenly spaced time series of oxygen isotope values and keep running into the following error messages.??x is a series of oxygen isotope values (all negative numbers)y is a series of calibrated or estimated radiocarbon dates ranging from 0 BP to 7000 BP.??
the unevenly spaced time series has over 2000 values.??
The code I've used is as follows:
y<-as.numeric(y)
x<-as.numeric(x)redfit.x<-redfit(x,t=y,tType="time")


and the error message--
Error in redfit(x, t = y, tType = "time") :?? REAL() can only be applied to a 'numeric', not a 'integer'In addition: Warning message:In redfit(x, t = y, tType = "time") :? Duplicate times in 't', averaging data
So, then I say, okay, maybe the time type is what is throwing it off--

?redfit.x<-redfit(x,t=y,tType="age")
and once again...
Error in redfit(x, t = y, tType = "age") :?? REAL() can only be applied to a 'numeric', not a 'integer'In addition: Warning message:In redfit(x, t = y, tType = "age") : Duplicate ages in 't', averaging data
The oxygen isotope data isn't what is causing an issue per se, since redfit will run with that alone (but since it makes assumptions on the time spacing, that tosses any valid results due to the uneven spacing).
And a sample of my data:
x? [1]? -5.62? -8.93? -6.68? -7.25? -4.93? -7.22? -4.96? -6.30? -4.91? -5.83? -4.00? [12]? -5.50? -5.74? -5.91? -6.12? -5.44? -4.93? -5.20? -4.83? -4.91? -4.74? -4.44? [23]? -4.86? -4.86? -4.70? -5.25? -5.77? -5.23? -7.01? -6.56? -4.70? -5.46? -6.96? [34]? -6.61? -5.27? -4.87? -5.26? -5.79? -4.65? -5.44? -7.07? -5.03? -5.91? -6.08? [45]? -7.76? -6.39? -5.43? -5.45? -5.54? ...
y? [1]? ? 2? ? 5? ? 7? ? 9? ?13? ?16? ?18? ?20? ?21? ?24? ?25? ?28? ?31? ?37? ?43? ?47? [17]? ?51? ?54? ?57? ?63? ?68? ?70? ?72? ?75? ?78? ?80? ?83? ?84? ?87? ?89? ?89? ?93? [33]? ?95? ?97? ?98? ?99? 101? 103? 106? 106? 108? 110? 110? 112? 115? 116? 118? 123? [49]? 124? 124? 127? 128? 130 ...
Any advice would be appreciated.? Also, anyone know of another redfit spectral analysis program other than what is in astrochron?
best, Mark Hall

Hello,

  I am trying to quit a current session on RStudio and the ?quitting
session? prompt from R has just continued to load. I assume that R is not
responding for some reason. If the problem persists, and I were to
uninstall and then reinstall R, would my saved .RData and other R files and
environments saved on my desktop be deleted?

Not sure if any other solutions to this issue.

Best,

Spencer

A) You ask whether uninstalling RStudio will delete files... I don't think so but this is not the support area for RStudio.

B) R will not delete your data files when uninstalled.

C) I suspect that reinstalling software is unlikely to repair the symptoms you describe (sounds like buggy software to me). Simply restarting RStudio and plowing on would be about as effective but less work. However there have been mentions on this list of bugs in RStudio related to incompatibility with R 3.6, [1] which might be related to your problems so upgrading RStudio to beta or downgrading R to 3.5.3 may make a difference.

Message-ID: <CAPQaxLOuHyaR04PCC=NPefM4=0Xxb9wzD-OONr5Wf1EcSa7_+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

  I am trying to reload some data into R in order to check to see if it is
formatted as a matrix. I used the command options(max.print = 10000000) to
account for the 20,000 some rows omitted previously when just using the
basic version of this function. After entering this command, the dataset
mostly loaded into R, but 14717 rows were still omitted.

  Can I simply increase the number indicted after 'max.print =' to read in
the remaining rows, or should I use 'bigfile.sample <-' or
'bigfile.colclass <-' instead? Do I even need to read in all of the rows to
test for a matrix?

Best,

Spencer

I don?t think this option affects how much data is read in, just how much is printed to the screen. Use the function str() on your imported object to see how many rows, among other things, were brought in.

Thank you,

Here is a summary of the resulting output....

>nrow(GBM.txt)
[1] 20530
> ncol(GBM.txt)
[1] 173

This corresponds with the info found in my global environment for the
object indicated. Now, how do I go about determining if the dataset is a
matrix?

Try any of

str(GBM.txt)
class(GBM.txt)

Also, like Kevin said, max.print only affects how much is printed, not 
the read functions. Why change max.print at all? The default value 
(1000) is large enough, I have never needed to see more than this at a 
time. In fact, to have an idea of the data I would rather further limit 
the number of matrix lines printed with

head(object)
tail(object)



Hope this helps,

Why did you not do as Kevin suggested??

Or, more simply, ?is.matrix
which could be found in ?matrix.

*Please* consult R's docs before posting such queries.

Using str(GBM.txt) produced the same output as last time, which lists the
number of objects acting on a particular number of variables for the said
dataset and a few rows read from the original file.

The result of class(GBM.txt) generates the following..

> class(GBM.txt)
[1] "data.frame"

Is this to say that the object is set as a 'data frame', opposed to a
'matrix' ?

I will try running ?is.matrix now

Hello,

Look at the output of these two commands:

1) str(<matrix object>)

str(matrix(0, nrow = 20530, ncol =173))
num [1:20530, 1:173] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...


The important part is

num [1:20530, 1:173]


This says it's a numeric vector with dimensions 20530 and 173, it's a matrix

2) str(<data.frame object>)

str(as.data.frame(matrix(0, nrow = 20530, ncol =173)))
'data.frame':	20530 obs. of  173 variables:
  $ V1  : num  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
  $ V2  : num  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
  $ V3  : num  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
  [...]


Now it's expressly written

'data.frame':	20530 obs. of  173 variables:


There are 173 variables eac h with the same number of observations, 20530.


When you read in data files with any form of read.table (read.csv is the 
same function with different arguments default values set), you will 
always get a data.frame.


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Consider ?is.matrix ?

It can seem like it is hung when you default to saving your workspace on
close and you have a very large workspace in memory relative to your hard
drive write speed.  Are you sure it isn't that?

The obvious question is "what do you mean, FORMATTED AS a matrix?"
Once you have read an object into R, you have no information about how it
was formatted.
Another question is "what do you mean, MATRIX"?
Do you mean the kind of R object specifically recognised by is.matrix,
or do you mean "rectangular arrangement of numbers", which would include
data frames as well?
Another obvious question is "how, EXACTLY, are you reading it?"
Why don't you *know* what you read it as?
If you use read.table or any of the other functions listed by ?read.table
you will always get a data frame, which is a rectangular arrangement that
*acts like* a matrix in many ways, but without actually being one.
If you want to read *part* of a file using one of those functions,
skip=M says to ignore the first M lines, and
nrows=N says to read the next N lines,
but the only way one of these functions would read less than all of the
input would be if memory ran out or the input was malformed.

Why do you need it to be a matrix? A data.frame is like a matrix, but 
allows columns of mixed types.

as.matrix() will coerce your data frame to a matrix if you really need this.

So even though a number of rows were omitted  during the ?print in? or
visualization of the dataset into my console, the data frame is now set as
a matrix? I believe so, per Mr. Barradas?s last email. Sorry for the
confusion, I was expecting the whole dataset to load into my console and
was concerned that perhaps if I had to set the data in the data frame as a
matrix (if not already), then I would not achieve this result.

Thanks,

Spencer

Spencer, what prints into your console is not the point. As others have
said, the best way to find it if an R object is the type matrix is
is.matrix() . That will return TRUE or FALSE.

You continue to labor under false conceptions, starting with your 
subject line indicating that you should be able to *see* your huge data 
set in the R console.
Take a pause, have a coffee or tea and re-read the helpful advice 
various people have tried to offer before continuing this thread.

 My apologies! I made this much to complicated and allowed myself to become
confused with the straightforward advice given. I tried running the lines
Mr. Barradas suggested after receiving the output for as.matrix() and I
understand now. Thank you all again for your patience.

Best,

Spencer

Note that I suggested reinstalling the "curl" package, not the "RCurl"
package. After all, it's curl's library and not RCurl's library that
is producing the error message.

Does anyone know what is the issue here? It is impossible to get an answer

Subject: [R] Calibrate survey using rake
Message-ID: <CALBYkj+yeqoAstU0_7aOLC_Z+KobDPWRYQhzen+HWWJR62_Xgg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I need to calibrate a survey using raking.
I already declared the complex design here:

des_survey <- svydesign(id= ~idd, strata= ~strata, data = datos, weights =
~ft, check.strata=TRUE  )
options(survey.lonely.psu = "remove")
options(digits = 10)

However, when I run the rake process, the tabulates using the original
weights and the calibrated doesn't match to the population marginals I
declared.

des_surveyR <- rake(dise?o, ~region, ~pop.region)

The population marginals is only one. Region is the variable. The data
frame pop.region containes the total to calibrate.

Subject: [R] Fw: Sample size required to estimate population variance
 Solution
Message-ID: <DM5PR02MB2778738C8F516F3308E8C91DB1F10@DM5PR02MB2778.namprd02.prod.outlook.com>

Colleagues,

The original question was how many samples should be taken in order to estimate a population standard deviation to within a defined percentage of its actual value.
In an article from The American Statistician, Volume 15, 1961, Issue 3, the sample size is given by:

N = (1/2) * (y/d)^2

Where y = the Z score of the confidence interval one desires and d = the desired margin of error as a percentage.

Note here that when coding this with R, one needs to apply the ceiling function to the equation since N may not be an integer.

The corresponding confidence intervals can be found using the equations in the article.

All the best,

You could consider the case of 50% power, though that'd not be exact for asymmetry.

But if this is a simple univariate data set, it sounds like messing around with chi-squared quantiles and uniroot ought to work. Exactly how are you calculating your confidence limits and which one (upper or lower) needs to be of a specific size?

This is often related to permissions' issues on your local machine, for
which you provided none of the (requested) info. If so, this is not an R
issue. See ?sessioninfo.

Also, this is a plain text list. Don't post in html, as it can make code

Hi Ana,
The first error message may be the critical one. "weight//NA" is
almost certainly not the name of the file you want, and two
consecutive slashes in a path is also incorrect. You may not have
placed the data files in the correct file structure, often a problem
with programs that are written with hard path codings. Without
actually trying to download the data and run the script, that is about
all the assistance I can provide. If you know someone who has
successfully run it, you may be able to get more specific advice.

Subject: [R] need help in if else condition
Message-ID: <CAA5NU8pR5tZ+0vjqeSMSpbW0E6QmfxVjBzAqVesvdhfMpZ7xZw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,
I am trying to run if else condition to alter my data. I have created a
column F with reference to column d  where I want to replace the value to
0 where ever it finds a string or character value like  -,dnr, post and
keep the rest of the rows should have the original value of column d. It is
converting the text to 0 but the numeric values are not the same it is some
value.. will you please help me to figure out why it is happening and what
should be the proper code

here are the code and the output

d=c(1,2,3,"-","dnr","post",10)
e= c(2,2,3,4,5,6,7)
de<- as.data.frame(cbind(d,e))
de$f<-ifelse (de$d=="-"|de$d=="dnr"|de$d=="post",0,de$d)

head(de)

  d e f
1  1 2 2
2  2 2  4
3  3 3 5
4  - 4 0
5  dnr 5 0
6 post 6 0
why the values are changing in  with if else condition

Change the definition of de to

de <- data.frame(d,e,stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

Then you should be ok.

Some additional remarks:

1. The ifelse() command is a bit tricky in R. Avoiding it is often a good
policy.
2. I find %in% very useful. You could replace the multiple conditions check
     de$d=="-"|de$d=="dnr"|de$d=="post"
    by
    de$d %in% c("-","dnr","post")

Following the comments above would lead to code such as

de <- data.frame(d,e,stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
de$f <- de$d
de$f[ de$d %in% c("-","dnr","post") ] <- 0

HTH,
Eric

Since this has already been answered, I'll just mention one point that was
not addressed.
> d=c(1,2,3,"-","dnr","post",10)
This is rather odd.
> str(d)
 chr [1:7] "1" "2" "3" "-" "dnr" "post" "10"
You can create a vector of logical values, or a vector of numbers, or a
vector of strings,
but if there is a string there, logical values and numbers convert to
strings.
So why not write
> e <- c( 2 , 2 , 3 , 4 ,   5 ,    6 ,  7 )
> d <- c("1","2","3","-","dnr","post","10")
> m <- c("-" = 0, "dnr" = 0, "post" = 0)  # mask unwanted values
> de <- data.frame(d = d, e = e, f = ifelse(is.na(m[d]), d, "0"),
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
> de
     d e  f
1    1 2  1
2    2 2  2
3    3 3  3
4    - 4  0
5  dnr 5  0
6 post 6  0
7   10 7 10

where the numbers in the d and f columns of the result are actually all
strings.

Dear All,

Please what could be the cause of this error, I created a GUI with shiny R
and it throws this error.
But running it alone in R, its fine.
I just need to know what are the possible causes for this error.

Thanks for your assistance.

You piqued my curiosity, can you elaborate a bit more on this?

The point (in this example) is that you might have introduced a bug because
you forgot that 'a' is a vector.
Looking (in isolation) at the assignment to 'x' you believe it's going to
be a single number, either 1 or 2 (unless you know the "shape" of a).
I've been burned by such issues.

The answer here is that in "ifelse(a < 3, ......)" you ALWAYS expect "a" to
be
a vector because there would be no point in using ifelse if it weren't.
If you believe that "a" is or ought to be a single number, you write
  x <- if (a < 3) 1 else 2
The whole point of ifelse is to vectorise.

Expectation: ifelse will use the same "repeat vectors to match the longest"
rule that other vectorised functions do.  So
a <- 1:5
b <- c(2,3)
ifelse(a < 3, 1, b)
=> ifelse(T T F F F <<5>>, 1 <<1>>, 2 3 <<2>>)
=> ifelse(T T F F F <<5>>, 1 1 1 1 1 <<5>>, 2 3 2 3 2 <<5>>)
=> 1 1 2 3 2
and that is indeed the answer you get.  Entirely predictable and consistent
with
other basic operations in R.

The only tricky thing I see is that R has
a strict vectorised  ifelse(logical.vector, some.vector, another.vector)
AND
a non-strict non-vectorised if (logical.scalar) some.value else
another.value
AND
a statement form if (logical.scalar) stmt.1; else stmt.2;

Of course the behavior of ifelse is predictable.
My point was that for newb's (I was one once) you can get burned if you
don't appreciate that ifelse is vectorized.
Especially if you have some "muscle memory" from using ifelse() in Excel.

Sigh. I don't agree with this "avoid ifelse because you might not know the shape of the arguments" advice. All R variables have shapes and sizes, and the better advice is to _pay attention to shapes and sizes_, especially when using vectorized functions like ifelse. An easy way to maintain shape/size consistency is to work with data frames at the top level of your code.

Which is not to say that I use ifelse liberally... it is not the most efficient way to get an answer in many cases. findInterval and cut are often better choices, as is in-place modification:

 x <- rep( 2, length( a ) )
 x[ a < 3 ] <- 1

which can be extended if needed.

Just for the records, there is a further form:
`if`(logical.scalar, stmt.1, stmt.2)

The main problem with ifelse is that 1) it is very slow, and 2) the mode 
of its return value can be unintuitive or not too predictable (see also 
the Value and Warning sections of ?ifelse). One has to be very careful 
and ensure that 'yes' and 'no' vectors have the same class, because 
ifelse will not warn you at all:
 > ifelse(c(TRUE, TRUE), 1:2, LETTERS[1:2])
[1] 1 2
 > ifelse(c(TRUE, FALSE), 1:2, LETTERS[1:2])
[1] "1" "B"

For options instead of base::ifelse, you might find this discussion helpful:

That last one is not R syntax. The semicolon in R separates statements, 
and "else stmt.2" is not a valid statement.

I'm sure that's just a typo, but I can't think of a variation on it that 
is different from the one before.

Hello,

I am trying to use this program:
https://github.com/kenhanscombe/ukbtools

> my_ukb_data[1:3,1:3]
      eid sex_f31_0_0 year_of_birth_f34_0_0

Error: Column 1 must be named.
Use .name_repair to specify repair.
Call `rlang::last_error()` to see a backtrace

Function is described here:
https://kenhanscombe.github.io/ukbtools/reference/ukb_icd_diagnosis.html

I run it on:

$platform
[1] "x86_64-pc-linux-gnu"
$arch
[1] "x86_64"
$version.string
[1] "R version 3.5.0 (2018-04-23)"

Would anyone know why this is happening?

Thanks!

First response: The ID column in your data is labeled "eid" but your
function call refers to "id".

Did you read the bug report from three weeks ago and the suggested fix documented on the webpage you cited?

Hi Patrick,

do you refer to this?
https://github.com/kenhanscombe/ukbtools/issues/20

I did it:

> devtools::install_github("kenhanscombe/ukbtools", build_vignettes = TRUE,
dependencies = TRUE,force=TRUE)

but still the same error:
> library(ukbtools)
> my_ukb_data <- ukb_df("ukb31212")
> ukb_icd_diagnosis(my_ukb_data, id = "1000017", icd.version = 10)
Error: Column 1 must be named.
Use .name_repair to specify repair.
Call `rlang::last_error()` to see a backtrace

Subject: [R] Curious about pairwise limits with cov()
Message-ID: <BN7PR05MB58578DD3FBC0BB6B86A2B0F3CAF30@BN7PR05MB5857.namprd05.prod.outlook.com>

The help for cov() clearly notes that pairwise only works with pearson. I'm curious why as it is surely not computational. Certainly an analyst knows the nature of the missingness in their data and if it's not MCAR then applying pairwise to spearman would have the same inferential consequence as when pearson is used with data that are also not MCAR.

Looking for enlightenment here.

Thanks,
Harold

Hi. I always thank you all of the R program worker and researchers.

I am using R for my thesis, and I have a question.

I am simulating multi-dimensional and categorical items (polytomous) with mirt-simdata.
However, I wish each items' categories are normal distribution. I checked a lot of information from the internet. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a good one.
It looks like before version, there is a 'simdata_normal' function, but not anymore.
Is there another way to simulate the normal distribution of the multi-dimensional item polytomous-responses?

Here is my code, I was working on.

#two dimensional categorical data simulation
Theta <- rmvnorm(10000, sigma = matrix(c(1, .5, .5, 1), 2)) #correlation of .5
summary(Theta)

set.seed(12345)
#slope matrix of 20 rows=items, a1=10 factor 1, a2=10 factor 2
aa <- matrix(c(rlnorm(20,.2,.3),rep(0,40),rlnorm(20,.2,.3)),40) #rlnorm-log normal distribution
dd<-matrix(rnorm((40*4),0,2.0), 40)
dd <- t(apply(dd, 1, sort, decreasing=TRUE)) #sort since intercepts are ordered
polytomous4 <- simdata(aa, dd, 10000, Theta=Theta, itemtype = 'gpcm')
summary(polytomous4)

Can anyone please check and help me?
I desperately have to figure out this problem as soon as possible.

Thank you very much for reading my question.
Have a good day.
God bless you!

Hi. again.

Still the same problem, but I made a new code to see better of my question.
Like the first email, I still want each item's categories to have a normal distribution. it doesn't have to statistically fit. I made 2 different code. And, I found if the histogram is the opposite, they will be normal distributions.
In detail, most items have the highest frequencies(probabilities) in the first category and the last category. The middle categories are fewer frequencies.

Is there any way to opposite the frequency, so that each item has normal category distribution?

I have to figure out this problem. Please help me!

Subject: Re: mirt-simdata question.

Hi. I always thank you all of the R program worker and researchers.

I am using R for my thesis, and I have a question.

I am simulating multi-dimensional and categorical items (polytomous) with mirt-simdata.
However, I wish each items' categories are normal distribution. I checked a lot of information from the internet. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a good one.
It looks like before version, there is a 'simdata_normal' function, but not anymore.
Is there another way to simulate the normal distribution of the multi-dimensional item polytomous-responses?

Here is my code, I was working on.

#two dimensional categorical data simulation
Theta <- rmvnorm(10000, sigma = matrix(c(1, .5, .5, 1), 2)) #correlation of .5
summary(Theta)

set.seed(12345)
#slope matrix of 20 rows=items, a1=10 factor 1, a2=10 factor 2
aa <- matrix(c(rlnorm(20,.2,.3),rep(0,40),rlnorm(20,.2,.3)),40) #rlnorm-log normal distribution
dd<-matrix(rnorm((40*4),0,2.0), 40)
dd <- t(apply(dd, 1, sort, decreasing=TRUE)) #sort since intercepts are ordered
polytomous4 <- simdata(aa, dd, 10000, Theta=Theta, itemtype = 'gpcm')
summary(polytomous4)

Can anyone please check and help me?
I desperately have to figure out this problem as soon as possible.

Thank you very much for reading my question.
Have a good day.
God bless you!

You're asking a question unrelated to R programming and so you won't get a useful response here. However, your question also suggests a misunderstanding of IRT. Generating multi-dimensional data involves generating ability estimates with additional nuisance dimensions and that has no relationship with the distributional properties of the categorical values.

Probably better to start a thread on another email list that can help you first understand MIRT.

Hi Jim,

Thanks for your email.
My question was: how to change the x axis labels without changing the chart.
Or is that not possible?
Using your example, I added another column:
sydf<-read.table(text="year1 month-day rate
 1993 05-01 0.608
 1994 06-01 0.622
 1996 07-01 0.623
 1998 08-01 0.647
 2000 09-01 0.646
 2002 10-01 0.625
 2004 11-01 0.628
 2006 12-01 0.685
 2008 01-01 0.679
 2010 02-01 0.595
 2012 03-01 0.567
 2014 04-01 0.599
 2016 05-01 0.642
 2018 06-01 0.685",
                 header=TRUE)

How can I show the column "month-day" as labels on the x axis, but still
have the plot showing the chart as rate based on year?
I tried this:
plot(sydf$year,sydf$rate,type="b",
     xlab="month-day",ylab="Rate")

but this only changes the title of the x axis to "month-day". I want the
values on the x axis to show 05-01  06-01, etc.
Is that possible?

Thanks,
Steven

Hi Steven,
A basic plot can be displayed like this:

sydf<-read.table(text="year rate
 1993 0.608
 1994 0.622
 1996 0.623
 1998 0.647
 2000 0.646
 2002 0.625
 2004 0.628
 2006 0.685
 2008 0.679
 2010 0.595
 2012 0.567
 2014 0.599
 2016 0.642
 2018 0.685",
header=TRUE)
plot(sydf$year,sydf$rate,type="b",
xlab="Year",ylab="Rate")

When you add more years and rates to the data frame, the axes will change to
include the years and rates outside the ones in your example. As some have
noted, this is a very basic question.

Sorry Jim, I saw that you answered to the other Steven.
I had a question and nobody responded to that yet, I thought you responded
to me.
I searched for mine and your email came up, but I realize the subject line
is different. My question was:
"How to change x axes labels in plot_ly?"

values on the x axis to show 05-01  06-01, etc.
Is that possible?

Thanks,
Steven

Hi Steven,
A basic plot can be displayed like this:

sydf<-read.table(text="year rate
 1993 0.608
 1994 0.622
 1996 0.623
 1998 0.647
 2000 0.646
 2002 0.625
 2004 0.628
 2006 0.685
 2008 0.679
 2010 0.595
 2012 0.567
 2014 0.599
 2016 0.642
 2018 0.685",
header=TRUE)
plot(sydf$year,sydf$rate,type="b",
xlab="Year",ylab="Rate")

When you add more years and rates to the data frame, the axes will change to
include the years and rates outside the ones in your example. As some have
noted, this is a very basic question.

There's a typo in the first column name of your data - "year1" should
be "year". Sometimes R will do partial matching and find it, but not
always. Is this closer to what you're looking for?

plot(rate~year, sydf, type="b", xaxt="n", xlab="Month-Day")
axis(1, sydf$year, sydf$month.day)

This will probably leave out some labels because there is not enough
room. You can print the labels smaller:

axis(1, sydf$year, sydf$month.day, cex.axis=.75)

or rotate them 90 degrees:

axis(1, sydf$year, sydf$month.day, las=2)'

*Please* go through one or more of the web tutorials on plotting in R. I
feel that it is unfair of you to ask for such basic tutorials here when
resources are already available to you (others may disagree, of course). If
you have questions *after* reading, then feel free to ask here.

Thank you for answering.
I know mirt is not related the distribution of categories.
My study is factor analysis results difference of limited information methods and full information methods. I need a simulation data to compare those. And limited information factor analysis need an assumption of normality.

I do not know whether other ways of simulating code for multi- dimensions and categorical items than Mirt.
If you have some idea, please let me know.

Thank you for quick answering.
I always think R is the best program. I appreciate all team of R-program.

You're asking a question unrelated to R programming and so you won't get a useful response here. However, your question also suggests a misunderstanding of IRT. Generating multi-dimensional data involves generating ability estimates with additional nuisance dimensions and that has no relationship with the distributional properties of the categorical values.

Probably better to start a thread on another email list that can help you first understand MIRT.

Hi. again.

Still the same problem, but I made a new code to see better of my question.
Like the first email, I still want each item's categories to have a normal distribution. it doesn't have to statistically fit. I made 2 different code. And, I found if the histogram is the opposite, they will be normal distributions.
In detail, most items have the highest frequencies(probabilities) in the first category and the last category. The middle categories are fewer frequencies.

Is there any way to opposite the frequency, so that each item has normal category distribution?

I have to figure out this problem. Please help me!

Subject: Re: mirt-simdata question.

Hi. I always thank you all of the R program worker and researchers.

I am using R for my thesis, and I have a question.

I am simulating multi-dimensional and categorical items (polytomous) with mirt-simdata.
However, I wish each items' categories are normal distribution. I checked a lot of information from the internet. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a good one.
It looks like before version, there is a 'simdata_normal' function, but not anymore.
Is there another way to simulate the normal distribution of the multi-dimensional item polytomous-responses?

Here is my code, I was working on.

#two dimensional categorical data simulation Theta <- rmvnorm(10000, sigma = matrix(c(1, .5, .5, 1), 2)) #correlation of .5
summary(Theta)

set.seed(12345)
#slope matrix of 20 rows=items, a1=10 factor 1, a2=10 factor 2 aa <- matrix(c(rlnorm(20,.2,.3),rep(0,40),rlnorm(20,.2,.3)),40) #rlnorm-log normal distribution dd<-matrix(rnorm((40*4),0,2.0), 40) dd <- t(apply(dd, 1, sort, decreasing=TRUE)) #sort since intercepts are ordered
polytomous4 <- simdata(aa, dd, 10000, Theta=Theta, itemtype = 'gpcm')
summary(polytomous4)

Can anyone please check and help me?
I desperately have to figure out this problem as soon as possible.

Thank you very much for reading my question.
Have a good day.
God bless you!

Hi. Again.

I still cannot understand that why the simulated categories have opposite of normal distribution. Theta is set as normal function. Then, more obs. should have more proportion of middle categories. But, all items of simulated data have the most probabilities at the least ability category ?0? or the highest ?4? .
Isn?t it strange?

Please check and run the code from my previous mail.

Thank you.

Thank you for answering.
I know mirt is not related the distribution of categories.
My study is factor analysis results difference of limited information methods and full information methods. I need a simulation data to compare those. And limited information factor analysis need an assumption of normality.

I do not know whether other ways of simulating code for multi- dimensions and categorical items than Mirt.
If you have some idea, please let me know.

Thank you for quick answering.
I always think R is the best program. I appreciate all team of R-program.

You're asking a question unrelated to R programming and so you won't get a useful response here. However, your question also suggests a misunderstanding of IRT. Generating multi-dimensional data involves generating ability estimates with additional nuisance dimensions and that has no relationship with the distributional properties of the categorical values.

Probably better to start a thread on another email list that can help you first understand MIRT.

Hi. again.

Still the same problem, but I made a new code to see better of my question.
Like the first email, I still want each item's categories to have a normal distribution. it doesn't have to statistically fit. I made 2 different code. And, I found if the histogram is the opposite, they will be normal distributions.
In detail, most items have the highest frequencies(probabilities) in the first category and the last category. The middle categories are fewer frequencies.

Is there any way to opposite the frequency, so that each item has normal category distribution?

I have to figure out this problem. Please help me!

I don't understand your question.

> I am simulating multi-dimensional and categorical items

What do you mean by "and"?
Reading this sentence alone, I would assume you want one simulated dataset
that's categorical and multivariate.
Which is easy to do...
Because (in general) you can simulate multivariate categorical data the
same way as univariate categorical data...

> However, I wish each items' categories are normal distribution.

But here's the problem.
Now you say you want "each" to have a normal distribution.
So, not categorical, but normal.
Also, "each" implies that you have multiple univariate distributions rather
than one multivariate distribution.
Which are not quite the same thing...

> simulate the normal distribution of the multi-dimensional item
polytomous-responses?

Complete contradiction.
(Sorry).

> Here is my code, I was working on.
> #two dimensional categorical data simulation
> Theta <- rmvnorm(10000, sigma = matrix(c(1, .5, .5, 1), 2)) #correlation

ulti-dimensional item polytomous-responses?

I'm assuming that you're using the mvtnorm package (you didn't say).
This will not produce categorical data.
It will produce data approximating a bivariate normal distribution.

My bivariate package vignette contains examples of both bivariate
categorical and bivariate normal distributions.

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bivariate/vignettes/bivariate.pdf

The bivariate normal distributions make use of the mvtnorm package, so
based on the same principles as your code examples.
Hope that helps.

Hi Steven,
It is pretty easy, but there are one or two things to watch for.
First, don't use a hyphen in a field name unless you enclose it in
single quotes when extracting it. I've just removed the hyphen in this
example:

sydf<-read.table(text="year1 monthday rate
 1993 05-01 0.608
 1994 06-01 0.622
 1996 07-01 0.623
 1998 08-01 0.647
 2000 09-01 0.646
 2002 10-01 0.625
 2004 11-01 0.628
 2006 12-01 0.685
 2008 01-01 0.679
 2010 02-01 0.595
 2012 03-01 0.567
 2014 04-01 0.599
 2016 05-01 0.642
 2018 06-01 0.685",
 header=TRUE,
 stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
sydf$date<-as.Date(paste(sydf$year1,sydf$monthday),"%Y %m-%d")
library(plotrix)
par(mar=c(6,4,4,2))
plot(sydf$date,sydf$rate,type="b",xaxt="n")
staxlab(1,at=sydf$date,labels=sydf$monthday)

Note that I have also added the stringsAsFactors argument to prevent
monthdate being read as a factor. I expected that the axis labels
would be crowded so I used the plotrix library to stagger the x-axis
labels. Hope this solves your problem.

Thanks Jim, that worked.

> I expected that the axis labels would be crowded so I used the plotrix library to stagger the x-axis labels. Hope this solves your problem.
I liked how that showed, not overlapping on each other. I wasn't aware of the plotrix library.

In my code I was using plot_ly for visualization, because it looked nicer compared to the simple plot() function, and I have the chart in a Shiny dashboard (RMD file).
I found in the meantime today some code example for plot_ly and using the same data it looks like this:
sydf<-read.table(text="year1 monthday rate
 1993 05-01 0.608
 1994 06-01 0.622
 1996 07-01 0.623
 1998 08-01 0.647
 2000 09-01 0.646
 2002 10-01 0.625
 2004 11-01 0.628
 2006 12-01 0.685
 2008 01-01 0.679
 2010 02-01 0.595
 2012 03-01 0.567
 2014 04-01 0.599
 2016 05-01 0.642
 2018 06-01 0.685",
                 header=TRUE,
                 stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

library(plotly)
plot_ly(sydf,
        x = ~year1,
        y = ~rate,
        type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines') %>%
  layout(
    xaxis = list(
      ticktext = sydf$monthday,
      tickvals = sydf$year1,
      tickmode = "array",
      tickangle = 270
    ))

This is where I found about the parameters:
https://plot.ly/r/tick-formatting/

Now my other challenge is that with my data I have a lot more values on the x axis, and they overlap even when turned vertically. I guess there must be a way of taking a number of values evenly from the list of x axis lables, and use that for the "ticktext" parameter.
I thought it must be some variation of the seq(from, to, by= ). Can I use that with a list of strings?

Thanks,
Steven

Hi Steven,
It is pretty easy, but there are one or two things to watch for.
First, don't use a hyphen in a field name unless you enclose it in single quotes when extracting it. I've just removed the hyphen in this
example:

sydf<-read.table(text="year1 monthday rate
 1993 05-01 0.608
 1994 06-01 0.622
 1996 07-01 0.623
 1998 08-01 0.647
 2000 09-01 0.646
 2002 10-01 0.625
 2004 11-01 0.628
 2006 12-01 0.685
 2008 01-01 0.679
 2010 02-01 0.595
 2012 03-01 0.567
 2014 04-01 0.599
 2016 05-01 0.642
 2018 06-01 0.685",
 header=TRUE,
 stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
sydf$date<-as.Date(paste(sydf$year1,sydf$monthday),"%Y %m-%d")
library(plotrix)
par(mar=c(6,4,4,2))
plot(sydf$date,sydf$rate,type="b",xaxt="n")
staxlab(1,at=sydf$date,labels=sydf$monthday)

Note that I have also added the stringsAsFactors argument to prevent monthdate being read as a factor. I expected that the axis labels would be crowded so I used the plotrix library to stagger the x-axis labels. Hope this solves your problem.

Hi Steven,
Neat solution. With a lot more values on the time axis, you will be
better off with something like:

yrticks<-as.Date(as.character(seq(min(sydf$year1),max(sydf$year1),by=2)),
 "%Y")
axis(1,at=yrticks,labels=format(yrticks,"%Y"))

You probably won't need staxlab for that.

Jim

Thanks Jim.

I am trying to apply this to my version with plot_ly, and couldn't make it to work.
The sydf$year1 field is numeric, so the min() and max() works, but when I tried to use your formula for the sydf$monthday field I get an error:
yrticks <- as.Date(as.character(seq(min(sydf$monthday),max(sydf$monthday),by=2)),
                  "%Y")

Error in seq.default(min(sydf$monthday), max(sydf$monthday), by = 2) : 
  'from' must be a finite number
In addition: Warning message:
In seq.default(min(sydf$monthday), max(sydf$monthday), by = 2) :
  NAs introduced by coercion

So I thought maybe you need to sample the tickvals not the ticktext and it would show the corresponding tick labels in the right palaces. Then I tried the way you had like this:
sydf<-read.table(text="year1 monthday rate
 1993 05-01 0.608
 1994 06-01 0.622
 1996 07-01 0.623
 1998 08-01 0.647
 2000 09-01 0.646
 2002 10-01 0.625
 2004 11-01 0.628
 2006 12-01 0.685
 2008 01-01 0.679
 2010 02-01 0.595
 2012 03-01 0.567
 2014 04-01 0.599
 2016 05-01 0.642
 2018 06-01 0.685",
                 header=TRUE,
                 stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

yrticks <- as.Date(as.character(seq(min(sydf$year1),max(sydf$year1),by=2)),
                  "%Y")

library(plotly)
plot_ly(sydf,
        x = ~year1,
        y = ~rate,
        type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines') %>%
  layout(
    xaxis = list(
      ticktext = sydf$monthday,
      tickvals = sydf$yrticks,
      tickmode = "array",
      tickangle = 270
    ))

But the chart didn't show any tick labels.
I guess I need to sample sydf$monthday, right? Because that's what I want to show as tick labels. But the problem is that monthday is string, and can't use a value for "by=", maybe I need to sample somehow by the index position.

Thanks,
Steven

Hi Steven,
Neat solution. With a lot more values on the time axis, you will be better off with something like:

yrticks<-as.Date(as.character(seq(min(sydf$year1),max(sydf$year1),by=2)),
 "%Y")
axis(1,at=yrticks,labels=format(yrticks,"%Y"))

You probably won't need staxlab for that.

Jim

"ifelse is very slow"?  Benchmark time.

> y <- runif(1000000)

   user  system elapsed

   user  system elapsed
  0.026   0.012   0.038

This appears to be a quality-of-implementation bug.

Hi Steven,
year1 is a number (e.g. 1993), monthday (e.g. 05-01) is not.

Oh, sorry, I think I see what you have tried to do. You want yearly
ticks but month-day labels. These won't mean much unless you also have
the year. If you ask for a date with just the year, as.Date will give
you a date in the middle of that year:

as.Date("2002","%Y")
[1] "2002-07-13"

So making the labels these mid-year dates as character strings might
do what you want:

yrlabels<-as.character(yrticks)

Hello:


 ????? What do you suggest I do about modeling random truncation?


 ?????? I have data on a variable Y in strata S[0], S[1], ..., S[n], 
where Y is always observed in S[0] but is less often observed in the 
other strata.? I assume that the probability of observing Y is a 
monotonically increasing function of Y and a monotonically decreasing 
function of d[i] = the distance from S[0] to S[i].


 ????? There is a section on "random truncation" in the Wikipedia 
article on "Truncated distribution".[1]? It would be nice if I had an R 
package that would make it relatively easy to model the truncation as a 
function of "d" and / or publication that described someone doing it in 
R.? (I also have a couple of other variables that influence the 
distribution of Y.)


 ????? Thanks,
 ????? Spencer Graves

I suspect that R has everything you need, already.
However, I suspect you may need to reformulate your question to find what
you need.

That's like flipping a coin, and saying the probability of observing heads
is a monotonically increasing function of heads.

Did you search on e.g. "model truncation" at rseek.org? Several packages
came up that appear to deal with truncated data, though I have no clue
whether in the way you specify.

Good question!  Probably the best answer is "Give up and go to the pub!" :-)

But seriously, there is a package DTDA on CRAN which purports to analyse 
randomly truncated data.

I'd just like to add that many many years ago, probably back before you 
were born, I struggled mightily for a while with random truncation, 
modelling the truncation variable to have a density that was uniform on 
some interval [a,b].

I took the underlying ("untruncated") variable to have a Gaussian 
distribution N(mu,sigma^2).

The distribution of the randomly truncated variable has thus four 
parameters: a, b, mu and sigma.  I was able to write down the likelihood 
and attempted to maximise it, but this was a nightmare since the partial 
derivatives of the log likelihood are undefined for b=x_i where x_1, 
..., x_n are the i.i.d. observations from the randomly truncated 
distribution.  I fought with this for a long while, could not get 
estimates based on simulated data to agree at all well with the true 
values, and eventually chucked it all in.

This all happened back before there was R, or even S!!!

Let us hope that the authors of DTDA are far clever than I.  (Not at all 
unlikely!)

cheers,

Rolf

I read the Wikipedia article more carefully.
The formula is relatively simple, and is based on the application of Bayes
Theorem.
If one doesn't want to work out the integral, numerical methods can be used.

However, the problem needs to be defined *precisely* first.

I am mystified as to what you are saying here.  What integral?
As I said, I could write down the likelihood.  Explicitly.  Maximising 
it (numerically *of course*) turned out to be problematic.  Back then.
Modern optimisers might help.  Presumably the DTDA package has a 
reasonable procedure.  (I haven't looked at it.)

> However, the problem needs to be defined *precisely* first.

Again I have no idea of what you are driving at here.  The concept of 
"random truncation" is quite precisely defined.

cheers,

Rolf

Never mind. Thanks.

I found that adding parameter right=F to the call fixes it.

I know I got some errors along the way, and tried solutions to direct R

Any ideas? I know this worked for me before. Not sure what went wrong 
this time. Only thing I can think of is the installation saying that the 
directory was not writeable, so I said 'yes' to install in my personal 
folder. Created the .Renviron to point to my personal directory and it 
shows in the list when running .libPath()

Thanks.

Drawing a histogram of discrete data often leads to bad results. 
Histograms are intended for continuous data, where no observations fall 
on bin boundaries.

You often get a more faithful representation of discrete data using 
something like

plot(table(x))

These are the wrong diagnostics, and it looks to me like the packages you are trying to install are unrelated.

Try installing one package and show us the output that follows that request, not the warnings. Mention if you are using as any elevated privileges and give the output of sessionInfo().

Note that the curl package has system requirements [1] that must be addressed outside of R before that package can be installed.

What do you mean by "I know this worked for me before. Not sure what went wrong this time." What changed between then and now? New computer? New version of R? Upgraded  OS?

Correct:? In my case, I confess I hadn't thought this through completely 
before posting.? I tried Rseek, as Bert Gunter suggested.? That led me 
to the "truncreg" and "DTDA" packages, neither of which seemed to be 
what I wanted;? thanks to Bert, Rolf, and Abby for your comments.


 ????? I'm observing Y[i] = (X[i]'b+e) given Y[i]>(z[i]'c+f) where e and 
f are normally distributed with standard deviations s and t, 
respectively, i = 1:n.? I want the total of all the Y's, including those 
truncated (and not observed).


 ????? I think the likelihood is the product of the density of Y[i] 
given x[i] and given that Y[i] is actually observed.? The latter can be 
further written as follows:


 ??? ??????? (x[i]'b+e)>(z[i]c+f)
iff
 ??? ??????? (x[i]'b-z[i]'c)>(f-e),


Therefore, the probability that Y[i] is observed is


 ??? ??????? Pr{Y[i] observed} = Phi((x[i]'b-z[i]'c)/sqrt(s^2+t^2))


where Phi is the cdf of the standard normal.


 ????? And then the likelihood for observation i can be written as follows:


 ??? ?? ???? f(y[i]|x[i], z[i], b, c, s, t) = phi((y[i]-x[i]'b)/s) / 
Phi((x[i]'b-z[i]'c)/sqrt(s^2+t^2).


 ????? We may not be able to estimate "c" in this, because if one of the 
z[i]'s is nonzero, we can pick "c" so z[i]'c is Inf.? That makes the 
denominator 0 and the likelihood Inf.? (If all the z[i]'s are zero, we 
still cannot estimate "c".)? However, if "b" is estimable, ignoring the 
truncation, then we can estimate "b", "s" and "t" given "c".


 ????? And then the desired total of all the Y's, observed and 
unobserved, would be the sum of y[i] divided by Pr{Y[i] observed}.


 ????? This likelihood is simple enough, it can be easily programmed in 
R and maximized over variations in "b", "s" and "t" given "c".? I can 
get starting values for "b" and "s" from "lm", ignoring the truncation.? 
And I can first fit the model assuming t = s, then test whether it's 
different using likelihood ratio.? And I can try to estimate "c", but I 
should probably use values I can estimate from other sources until I'm 
comfortable with the estimates I get for "b", "s" and "t" given an 
assumed value for "c".


 ????? Comments?
 ????? Thanks so much.
 ????? Spencer Graves

Also checkout MASS::truehist or simply consider setting breaks so as not to coincide with data values. (hist() not doing something like this, but instead actively aiming for pretty breaks is something of a design bug in my book, but ancient history and not easy to change at this point in time.)

This is a mailing list, not a web forum. The only way to "mark it as solved" is to send another message that indicates that, preferably with a usable summary of how you resolved it.

I am not sure what your point of comparison is for declaring incompatibilities is, but R _is_ a CLI program. An IDE like RStudio is normally interacting with the CLI for you so there are very few things that work differently between GUI and CLI (packages is not one of them, things like View and help are).

Best results are usually obtained on Ubuntu derivatives by following the instructions for the nearest Ubuntu version on CRAN [1]. There is also a mailing list for debian derivatives r-sig-debian. Once base R is working, always manage your package libraries as an individual user unless you really know what you are doing (don't use sudo for R packages).

Note that each minor version of R (x.y) gets its own set of packages, and complex package interdependencies such as tidyverse seem to break unless you get all of the dependencies installed in order. Some of those dependencies have system requirements that have to be installed with apt, so sometimes one has to install packages one at a time and read the CRAN package descriptions to get them working. Tidyverse can also be brittle under older versions of R, so the standard Mint packages may not be new enough depending on which packages you need to use.

Thank for the reply Jeff! I got a notice that my post needed moderator 
approval, so I wasn't sure where and how I can mark it as solved.

I uninstalled everything first, and realized I could get all of the 
additional packages I needed off the Mint repos, and everything worked 
well from thereon. Initially I had installed R from the Mint repos and 
then used CLI to install additional packages. That's when the problem 
occurred. I knew from my last system, that everything worked with no 
glitches, so I was trying to figure out what I did differently this time 
(it was the CLI). I guess there were incompatibilities with versions?

What do you mean "What integral?"...
The integral on the Wikipedia page.
(The same page referenced in the earlier posts).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_distribution#Random_truncation
https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/93717ffcd3bfa2a60d825bd71b5375ad888ceb97

Seems quite obvious to me...
Did you read the Wikipedia page?

I wasn't referring the problem of "random truncation".
I was referring to the original post.
In particular, how Y, S[i] and d[i] are defined.

Maybe, I should be more precise when suggesting others be more precise.
(My bad).

I note that Spencer has posted again.
I will read the new post, later, when I get some more time.

Firstly, we don't really need all your working.
Just the problem you want solve.

However, I'm still having difficulty understanding this.

> (x[i]'b+e)>(z[i]c+f)
> (x[i]'b-z[i]'c)>(f-e),

(1) What does the tick (or single quote) mean?
(2) What do you mean by "X[i]" and "observing Y[i]"?
(3) Are e and f random variables, or vectors of (observed) errors?
My intuitive understanding of (2), in the given context, would be that X
and Y are vectors of observations.
However, if e and f are random variables, wouldn't that would make Y[i] a
random variable too? In which case I'm not sure what you mean by
"observing".
Conversely, if e and f are vectors of (observed) errors, shouldn't they be
indexed (for consistency)? And in which case, there's no random component
in your expressions.
(4) Is lower case "x[i]" the same as upper case "X[i]", and what's "z[i]"?
(5) Is the mean of e and f, zero?
(6) So, you want to estimate b and c?
And wouldn't that make this a parameter estimation problem?
(In which case, you don't necessary need to model any distributions).

> Pr{Y[i] observed} = Phi((x[i]'b-z[i]'c)/sqrt(s^2+t^2))
> where Phi is the cdf of the standard normal.

This implies that "Y[i]" is a is binary (true or false) random variable.

Do you mean Pr (Y <= y) where Y is a random variable and y is a possible
value (from Y's sample space), that Y can be less than or equal to?
You can replace y with y[i] if you want, but the principle is the same.

Note my last response is probably off-topic.
I just wanted to highlight the need for defining problems in a way that
computers (and R programmers) can understand.

precise assumptions seemingly descriptive of an application that drove 
the initial post to this thread.? A reply by Abby Spurdle seemed to? me 
to raise questions, whose answers may not be intelligible without 
material snipped from Spurdle's reply.? I wish to thank Spurdle from the 
reply and apologize to those who feel this is an abuse of this list.? I 
trust that those in the latter category will please not bother to read 
further.? For anyone still interested in this problem, below please find 
my earlier analysis with corrections that attempt to respond to 
Spurdle's most recent concerns.? Thanks, Spencer Graves

Correct:? In my case, I confess I hadn't thought this through completely 
before posting.? I tried Rseek, as Bert Gunter suggested.? That led me 
to the "truncreg" and "DTDA" packages, neither of which seemed to be 
what I wanted;? thanks to Bert, Rolf, and Abby for your comments.


 ????? I'm observing a random variable Y[i] = (x[i]'b+e[i]) given 
Y[i]>(z[i]'c+f[i]) where the tick mark (') denotes transpose of a 
vector, and e and f are normally distributed with mean 0 and standard 
deviations s and t, respectively, i = 1:n.? Thus, Y[i] follows a 
truncated normal distribution with mean x[i]'b and standard deviation s, 
with the truncation condition being that Y[i]>(z[i]'c+f[i]).


 ????? I want the total of all the Y's from the untruncated 
distribution, i.e., including those truncated (and not observed).


 ????? I think the likelihood is the product of the density of Y[i] 
given x[i] and given that Y[i] is actually observed.? By substituting 
Y[i] = (x[i]'b+e[i]) into the truncation condition Y[i]>(z[i]'c+f[i]), 
we get the following:


 ??? ??????? (x[i]'b+e)>(z[i]c+f).


This occurs if and only if:


 ??? ??????? (x[i]'b-z[i]'c)>(f-e),


Therefore, the probability that Y[i] is observed (and not truncated) is


 ??? ??????? Pr{Y[i] observed} = Phi((x[i]'b-z[i]'c)/sqrt(s^2+t^2))


where Phi is the cdf of the standard normal.


 ????? And then the likelihood for observation i can be written as follows:


 ??? ?? ???? f(y[i]|x[i], z[i], b, c, s, t) = phi((y[i]-x[i]'b)/s) / 
Phi((x[i]'b-z[i]'c)/sqrt(s^2+t^2)).


 ????? We may not be able to estimate "c" in this, because if one of the 
z[i]'s is nonzero, we can pick "c" so z[i]'c is Inf.? That makes the 
denominator 0 and the likelihood Inf.? (If all the z[i]'s are zero, we 
still cannot estimate "c".)? However, if "b" is estimable, ignoring the 
truncation, then we can estimate "b", "s" and "t" given "c".


 ????? And then the desired total of all the Y's, observed and 
unobserved, would be the sum of y[i] divided by Pr{Y[i] observed}.


 ????? This likelihood is simple enough, it can be easily programmed in 
R and maximized over variations in "b", "s" and "t" given "c".? I can 
get starting values for "b" and "s" from "lm", ignoring the truncation.? 
And I can first fit the model assuming t = s, then test whether it's 
different using likelihood ratio.? And I can try to estimate "c", but I 
should probably use values I can estimate from other sources until I'm 
comfortable with the estimates I get for "b", "s" and "t" given an 
assumed value for "c".


 ????? Comments?
 ????? Thanks so much.
 ????? Spencer Graves

One common gotcha is that ifelse() has no way to reconcile attributes between the two alternatives so it takes the attributes for the result from those of the condition, which is almost certainly what you don't want. In particular, this may convert factors to their underlying integer codes. 

Another gotcha is that both alternatives are (usually) computed for all indices, whether or not that is sensible. (See, e.g., first example on help page.)

Four-core AMD E2-7110 running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
The R version is the latest in the repository:
r-base/bionic,bionic,now 3.4.4-1ubuntu1 all [installed]

Why not 3.6?  Because when i followed the installation instructions, adding

deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic-cran35/

to /etc/apt/sources.list, sudo apt update reported

W: GPG error: https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic-cran35/
InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public
key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 51716619E084DAB9
E: The repository 'https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu
bionic-cran35/ InRelease' is not signed.
N: Updating from such a repository can't be done securely, and is therefore
disabled by default.
N: See apt-secure(8) manpage for repository creation and user configuration
details.

I just repeated the test.

Did you ask for assistance on R-Sig-Debian? you will need to be more explicit than below about what you actually did. FWIW I was able to do it [1]... you might have encountered a temporary network problem.

	These two options have complementary strengths and weaknesses; the
	equal-width histogram oversmooths in regions of high density, and
	is poor at identifying sharp peaks; the equal-area histogram oversmooths
	in regions of low density, and so does not identify outliers. We
	describe a compromise approach which avoids both of these defects.
	We regard the histogram as an exploratory device, rather than as
	an estimate of a density. We argue that relying on the asymptotics
	of integrated mean squared error leads to inappropriate recommendations
	for choosing bin-widths. Datasets and R codes are available in the
	online supplements.},

I have not looked at the site for a while but I think it has some code in ?Splus which should work in R.

Also checkout MASS::truehist or simply consider setting breaks so as not to coincide with data values. (hist() not doing something like this, but instead actively aiming for pretty breaks is something of a design bug in my book, but ancient history and not easy to change at this point in time.)

yes!!
	including   plot(<factor>)  
 
[ if you really want, you can add something like   'lwd = 4' there ]

And relatedly, possibly more generally:

Many many people and hence useRs do
*NOT* distinguish between what R (and I think statistical graphics more
generally) calls  *histograms*  on one side vs
*bar plots* / *bar charts* / "spear charts"(?) etc on the other.

As Duncan said: Visually distinguishing quantities that are
inherently (mostly/almost) continuous ["mostly/..": think of quantum physics]
from those that are inherently "integer-like" or  categorical.

We (the R user community, notably the graphically oriented
subset) should really strive to keep these concepts and the
corresponding visualizations separate as well as possible
[and educate the consumers of our graphics if necessary ..]

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] packagefinder 0.1.4: Finding packages from the R
 console
Message-ID: <154001d535c6$b1f703d0$15e50b70$@zuckarelli.de>

Hello everyone,



Currently, there are more than 14,500 R packages on CRAN providing R with an
unparalleled wealth of features. The downside of the large and increasing
amount of packages is that it becomes increasingly difficult to find the
right tools to tackle a specific problem.



The 'packagefinder' package is designed to search for CRAN packages right
from the R console. The philosophy behind the package is that R users enjoy
working with the R console and need a tool to do their day-to-day-work on
CRAN without leaving their normal workspace, the console.



packagefinder helps you.

* . find the right package for your purpose

* . get detailed information about packages (incl. access to online
documentation)

* . learn about what's new on CRAN



Learn more about packagefinder:

* Read the web tutorial:
<http://www.zuckarelli.de/packagefinder/tutorial.html>
http://www.zuckarelli.de/packagefinder/tutorial.html

* Watch the video tutorial:  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Mes6_hYno>

Needing to transform some data for a time series (1930 - 2018). 

 

> tempDat
# A tibble: 89 x 13
    Year   Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov
Dec
   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
<dbl>
 1  1930  52    60.3  60.6  72.2  71.7  86.8  91.3  89.7  82.3  70.4  60.2
52.2
 2  1931  52.9  57.8  62.7  72.4  80.5  87    95.1  89.3  85.9  72.8  57.2
49.7
 3  1932  47    56.8  61.9  69.3  77.2  84.7  91.9  92.1  87    71.5  62.9
49.3
 
If I use the gather function:

 

tempDat.long <- gather(data=tempDat, key=month, value=temp, "Jan", "Feb",
"Mar",

 
"Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec")

 

> tempDat.long
# A tibble: 1,068 x 3
    Year month  temp
   <dbl> <chr> <dbl>
 1  1930 Jan    52  
 2  1931 Jan    52.9
 3  1932 Jan    47  
 4  1933 Jan    48.8
 5  1934 Jan    54.5

 

But I need it to be 

 

    Year month  temp
   <dbl> <chr> <dbl>
 1  1930 Jan    xx.x  
 2  1930 Feb    xx.x
 3  1930 Mar    xx.x
 4  1930 Apr    xx.x
 5  1930 May    xx.x

 

So would I need to use the lubridate package to rearrange my data or is
there a more straight forward method?

What happens if you use key=year?

Also, tables get mangled when you post in HTML to plain-text list.

I didn't communicate my problem to R-Sig-Debian because I had never
previously
heard of them.  Thank you for the tip.
Poking through the recent archives there I see other people
have had (different) trouble with the Bionic repository.

Fortunately, the instructions at
https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-r-on-ubuntu-18-04/
worked, after I first removed the existing installation of R.
All I had to do after that was reinstall about 180 packages.
Is there a way to do this automatically?

However, having installed "Action of the Toes" (are R releases named
by Culture AIs, by any chance?) I still find

Thanks Jim,

Yes, I only want to show the month and day as labels, because on my chart I am actually showing 2 line charts, one from the previous year, and one from this year, to compare them, and the month and day are matching for them, but the year would be different, so it makes sense to show only month and day on the x axis.
So it looks like I got the solution already for that part, the new challenge is that there were too many labels and overlapping on each other.
What is the best way to evenly sample values from a long list of string values?
So let's say my data was this overly simplified:
sydf<-read.table(text="year monthday rate
 1993 05-01 0.608
 1994 06-01 0.622
 1996 07-01 0.623
 1998 08-01 0.647
 2000 09-01 0.646
 2002 10-01 0.625
 2004 11-01 0.628
 2006 12-01 0.685
 2008 01-01 0.679
 2010 02-01 0.595
 2012 03-01 0.567
 2014 04-01 0.599
 2016 05-01 0.642
 2018 06-01 0.685",
                 header=TRUE,
                 stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

Then my x axis would be based on the values of sydf$monthday - In my case there are lots of values. How can I subset this to have only every n-th value? I guess this must be some common operation in R.
So if I have 200 values, and I only want to show 20 of them as labels, I would calculate n = 200/20 = 10 and I want to get every 10th value in the list sydf$monthday. But the list has strings, so I cannot use "by =".

Thank you,
Steven

Oh, sorry, I think I see what you have tried to do. You want yearly ticks but month-day labels. These won't mean much unless you also have the year. If you ask for a date with just the year, as.Date will give you a date in the middle of that year:

as.Date("2002","%Y")
[1] "2002-07-13"

So making the labels these mid-year dates as character strings might do what you want:

yrlabels<-as.character(yrticks)

Hello Everyone

                  I am trying to draw the smooth curve for my simulation and theoretical result. Anyone has any suggestion to me. Code given below.



library(ggplot2)

p <- c(0.0005,0.0025,0.0050,0.0075,0.0100,0.0200)

p_ sim1 <- c(0.3030,0.8245,0.9730,0.9955,1.0000,1.0000)

p_ the1 <- c(0.3935452,0.9181715,0.9933460,0.9994623,0.9999568,1.0000000)

p_ sim2 <- c(0.2900,0.8200,0.9720,0.9935,1.0000,1.0000)

p_ the2 <- c(0.2974667,0.8290809,0.9708782,0.9950537,0.9991625,0.9999993)

x<-data.frame(p,p_ sim1 ,p _the1,p _sim2,p _the2)

ggplot(x, aes(p, y = probability))+

  geom_line(aes(y = p_ sim1,col =" sim1"))+

  geom_line(aes(y = p_ the1,col =" the1")) +

  geom_line(aes(y = p_ sim2,col =" sim2")) +

  geom_line(aes(y = p_ the2,col =" the2"))+

  scale_colour_manual("",breaks = c("sim1"," the1"," sim2"," the2"),

                      values = c(1:4))

I didn't communicate my problem to R-Sig-Debian because I had never
previously
heard of them.  Thank you for the tip.
Poking through the recent archives there I see other people
have had (different) trouble with the Bionic repository.

Fortunately, the instructions at
https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-r-on-ubuntu-18-04/
worked, after I first removed the existing installation of R.
All I had to do after that was reinstall about 180 packages.
Is there a way to do this automatically?

However, having installed "Action of the Toes" (are R releases named
by Culture AIs, by any chance?) I still find
> x <- runif(1000000)
> y <- runif(1000000)
> system.time(ifelse(x < y, x, y))
   user  system elapsed
  0.087   0.047   0.135
> system.time(y + (x < y)*(x-y))
   user  system elapsed
  0.035   0.008   0.042
> system.time(pmin(x,y))
   user  system elapsed
  0.025   0.004   0.030

OK, I think I got this:

For example every 3rd element would be:
sydf$monthday[seq(1, length(sydf$monthday), 3)]

Thanks,
Steven

Thanks Jim,

Yes, I only want to show the month and day as labels, because on my chart I am actually showing 2 line charts, one from the previous year, and one from this year, to compare them, and the month and day are matching for them, but the year would be different, so it makes sense to show only month and day on the x axis.
So it looks like I got the solution already for that part, the new challenge is that there were too many labels and overlapping on each other.
What is the best way to evenly sample values from a long list of string values?
So let's say my data was this overly simplified:
sydf<-read.table(text="year monthday rate
 1993 05-01 0.608
 1994 06-01 0.622
 1996 07-01 0.623
 1998 08-01 0.647
 2000 09-01 0.646
 2002 10-01 0.625
 2004 11-01 0.628
 2006 12-01 0.685
 2008 01-01 0.679
 2010 02-01 0.595
 2012 03-01 0.567
 2014 04-01 0.599
 2016 05-01 0.642
 2018 06-01 0.685",
                 header=TRUE,
                 stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

Then my x axis would be based on the values of sydf$monthday - In my case there are lots of values. How can I subset this to have only every n-th value? I guess this must be some common operation in R.
So if I have 200 values, and I only want to show 20 of them as labels, I would calculate n = 200/20 = 10 and I want to get every 10th value in the list sydf$monthday. But the list has strings, so I cannot use "by =".

Thank you,
Steven

Oh, sorry, I think I see what you have tried to do. You want yearly ticks but month-day labels. These won't mean much unless you also have the year. If you ask for a date with just the year, as.Date will give you a date in the middle of that year:

as.Date("2002","%Y")
[1] "2002-07-13"

So making the labels these mid-year dates as character strings might do what you want:

yrlabels<-as.character(yrticks)

Your query is too basic to reply to -- that's what tutorials are for!

Subject: [R] Summary Table for Quantile Regression for Complex Survey
Message-ID: <YTOPR0101MB221786D4ACCA1B7E6DB2A8B59BCE0@YTOPR0101MB2217.CANPRD01.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hello All,


I am running quantile regression for a complex survey design and am running the following code:

newdf<-withReplicates(df, quote(coef(rq(api00~api99, tau=0.5, weights=.weights))))


This provides me with the theta and SE but I would really like the p-values and residual degrees of freedom.

summary(newdf) function does not work. Does anyone have any idea how to get p-values and rdf?


Thank you for your help,

Mav

Thank you! I tried that and it gives me the following:

  Min.  1st Qu.   Median     Mean  3rd Qu.     Max.

-0.05904 18.04000 36.15000 36.15000 54.25000 72.35000


I also tried the following code from Geraci:

format.rq.svy<-summary(newdf,rdf){

  V<-attr(newdf,"var")

  FLAG<-length(V)==1

  se<-if(FLAG) sqrt(V) else sqrt(diag(V))

  val<-cbind(as.matrix(newdf),se, NA, NA)

  if(FLAG) val<- matrix(val, nrow=1)

  val[,3]<-val[,1]/val[,2]

  val[,4]<-2*(1-pt(abs(val[,3]),rdf))

  colnames(val)<-c("Value", "Std.Error", "t value", "Pr(>|t|)")

  rownames(val)<-names(newdf)

  return(val)

}


where rdf is the residual degrees of freedom but unable to get information on rdf using "withReplicates". I was thinking if there is way to get rdf for complex survey data using another code and replace it here?


Thanks for your help,

Mavra

Hello All,


I am running quantile regression for a complex survey design and am running the following code:

newdf<-withReplicates(df, quote(coef(rq(api00~api99, tau=0.5, weights=.weights))))


This provides me with the theta and SE but I would really like the p-values and residual degrees of freedom.

summary(newdf) function does not work. Does anyone have any idea how to get p-values and rdf?


Thank you for your help,

Mav

Sorry, this still doesn't work.

When I use that expression in "ticktext" parameter, it shows those every 3rd label in the beginning, and after they finished, it shows some remaining values from "year" column.
When I tried with my real data, it was showing the original x axis values as lables, it seems like it ignored the "ticktext" parameter.
This is my short example:
sydf<-read.table(text="year monthday rate
 1993 05-01 0.608
 1994 06-01 0.622
 1996 07-01 0.623
 1998 08-01 0.647
 2000 09-01 0.646
 2002 10-01 0.625
 2004 11-01 0.628
 2006 12-01 0.685
 2008 01-01 0.679
 2010 02-01 0.595
 2012 03-01 0.567
 2014 04-01 0.599
 2016 05-01 0.642
 2018 06-01 0.685",
                 header=TRUE,
                 stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

library(plotly)
plot_ly(sydf,
        x = ~year,
        y = ~rate,
        type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines') %>%
  layout(
    xaxis = list(
      ticktext = sydf$monthday[seq(1, length(sydf$monthday), 3)],
      tickvals = sydf$year,
      tickmode = "array",
      tickangle = 270
    ))

Any ideas?

Thanks,
Steven

OK, I think I got this:

For example every 3rd element would be:
sydf$monthday[seq(1, length(sydf$monthday), 3)]

Thanks Jim,

Yes, I only want to show the month and day as labels, because on my chart I am actually showing 2 line charts, one from the previous year, and one from this year, to compare them, and the month and day are matching for them, but the year would be different, so it makes sense to show only month and day on the x axis.
So it looks like I got the solution already for that part, the new challenge is that there were too many labels and overlapping on each other.
What is the best way to evenly sample values from a long list of string values?
So let's say my data was this overly simplified:
sydf<-read.table(text="year monthday rate
 1993 05-01 0.608
 1994 06-01 0.622
 1996 07-01 0.623
 1998 08-01 0.647
 2000 09-01 0.646
 2002 10-01 0.625
 2004 11-01 0.628
 2006 12-01 0.685
 2008 01-01 0.679
 2010 02-01 0.595
 2012 03-01 0.567
 2014 04-01 0.599
 2016 05-01 0.642
 2018 06-01 0.685",
                 header=TRUE,
                 stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

Then my x axis would be based on the values of sydf$monthday - In my case there are lots of values. How can I subset this to have only every n-th value? I guess this must be some common operation in R.
So if I have 200 values, and I only want to show 20 of them as labels, I would calculate n = 200/20 = 10 and I want to get every 10th value in the list sydf$monthday. But the list has strings, so I cannot use "by =".

Thank you,
Steven

Oh, sorry, I think I see what you have tried to do. You want yearly ticks but month-day labels. These won't mean much unless you also have the year. If you ask for a date with just the year, as.Date will give you a date in the middle of that year:

as.Date("2002","%Y")
[1] "2002-07-13"

So making the labels these mid-year dates as character strings might do what you want:

yrlabels<-as.character(yrticks)

You will get the best help if you:

1. post email in plain text, not html
2. post the command/code you issued and the result/error that was returned
3. Information about your operating system sometimes helps.

Permission denied is an operating system issue... which is off topic here.

I will warn you that installing R on Windows using Run As Administrator is a recipe for disaster, and if you did this then resolving the mess will most likely require knowledgeable surgery on your file system permissions by a local Windows expert. However, I cannot tell that this is in fact your problem... it is merely something that may be relevant.

Please read the Posting Guide mentioned in the footer of this and every message on this mailing list. In particular you need to avoid letting your email software send HTML email to the list, as that can make it very hard to read.

Subject: [R] Problem with save/load across R versions and OS
Message-ID: <1078409789.2703833.1563352745004.JavaMail.zimbra@cognigencorp.com>

Hi, 

I am trying to transfer an S4 object from a machine working with CentOS 7.2 / R 3.4.3 to another one running Linux Mint 19 / R 3.6.0. If I save the object using saveRDS in obj.rds, loadRDS returns an "unknown input format" error on my Linux Mint machine. Interestingly enough, obj.rds loads just fine in a 3rd machine running Windows Server 2012 / R 3.4.3. I tried also using save and load and various values of the ascii and compression arguments, but still no cigar... 

Do you have recommendations on how to successfully transfer my object to my Linux Mint machine? 

Thanks 

Sebastien

Did something seriously change in R 3.6.1 at least for Windows in terms of stack impacts? 

I'm encountering many problems with the 00UNLOCK, needing to disable locking during installations. 

And I'm encountering 

> Error: C stack usage 63737888 is too close to the limit

for cases I did not before, even when all I'm doing is serializing an object to be saved with *saveRDS* or even *save.image(.)*. 

Yes, I know, I did not append a minimally complete example. Just wanted to see if it was just me, or if anyone else was seeing this.

It's on Windows 7 HE and I've run *R* here for years.

My inclination is to drop back to 3.6.0 if it is just me or if no one knows about this problem. 

Thanks,

 - Jan Galkowski.

It would never make sense for such messages to reflect normal and expected operation, so hypothesizing about intentionally changing stack behavior doesn't make sense.

The default format for saveRDS changed in 3.6.0. There may be bugs associated with that, but rolling back to 3.6.0 would just trade bugs.

 ????? What might be the likely outcomes of an attempt to reinstall 3.6.1?


 ????? And might that depend on whether the current 3.6.1 was 
uninstalled first?

I think that would depend on whether the bug was in the install program or not. In this case I would not bet on that being the problem.

I would either look for a patched release that addresses the bug, or roll back to 3.5.3. You might have luck with 3.6.0, but given that was when the major feature update occurred that option seems risky to me.

Did you try plain save/load ??
Also ?dump/source

Normally such a transfer should just work.  Reasons why it might not:

  - The error is being triggered by a contributed package somehow.  Do 
contributed package versions match?

  - There's no loadRDS function in base R, the base R function is 
readRDS.  If that's not just a typo above, then the loadRDS function 
you're using doesn't work.  Use the base package functions instead.

  - There's a bug in R.

In any case, we can't do much to help you without a reproducible example.

Did you try plain save/load ?? 
Also ?dump/source

Hi, 

I am trying to transfer an S4 object from a machine working with CentOS 7.2 / R 3.4.3 to another one running Linux Mint 19 / R 3.6.0. If I save the object using saveRDS in obj.rds, loadRDS returns an "unknown input format" error on my Linux Mint machine. Interestingly enough, obj.rds loads just fine in a 3rd machine running Windows Server 2012 / R 3.4.3. I tried also using save and load and various values of the ascii and compression arguments, but still no cigar... 

Do you have recommendations on how to successfully transfer my object to my Linux Mint machine? 

Thanks

Hi,

Indeed the S4 object is a class provided by a contributed package. However, the windows machine that reads the .rds fine does not even have the package installed.

I also confirm that I used readRDS (loadRDS was a typo on my part, sorry).

In this case, I cannot provide a reprex as the contributed package function that creates the S4 object connects to a local database with secured access. I could send the code, but only the authorized people could run it. This is not the ideal situation for problem solving...

I was wondering if there was a pathway through serialize / unserialize. I tried but I could not find the way to properly write and read the serialized object.

Thanks

Normally such a transfer should just work.  Reasons why it might not:

  - The error is being triggered by a contributed package somehow.  Do 
contributed package versions match?

  - There's no loadRDS function in base R, the base R function is 
readRDS.  If that's not just a typo above, then the loadRDS function 
you're using doesn't work.  Use the base package functions instead.

  - There's a bug in R.

In any case, we can't do much to help you without a reproducible example.

I don't know about that approach.

You can probably produce a reprex, it'll just be work:  copy the 
function from the contributed package, and edit it so that the line that 
reads from the database just generates some fake data in a similar 
format.  If you can make it reproducible, then cut out as much stuff as 
possible, keeping it reproducible, and post the final minimal reprex.

It's likely to take some time, but also likely to lead to a solution 
(either by you, when you notice a bug in the contributed package and can 
fix it, or by one of us, when you post the reprex and we dig in).

Good evening,

Hi,

I managed to transfer my object trough dput/dget and a text file export. I will look into stripping the function for the reprex creation when I have more time (this is a ginormous function)...

Thanks to your input and Bert's

I thought it successfully loaded after library(Biobase) but after
implementing your suggested I got the following....

Error in library(Biobase) : there is no package called ?Biobase?

So to download it would I try to rerun with Debug? This is an option given
as part of the return

The last sentence suggests, you did have 3.6.0 installed and you
are sure to not have seen such problems ??

In that case even more, we (R core, notably) would be interested
to see a minimal repr.ex  triggering the problem.
(and what is  '00UNLOCK' ?)

The example is from the apcluster documentation. Leaving any one of the "save"s uncommented produces said fault.

Hi Steven,
I caved in and installed plotly. Not an easy task. When I tried your
example, I got a blank HTML page displayed. I then created a plot with
your data above showing every third monthday label. If this is what
you want, maybe the way I have coded it will work in plotly.

sydf$date<-as.Date(paste(sydf$year,sydf$monthday),"%Y %m-%d")
plot(sydf$date,sydf$rate,type="l",xaxt="n")
every3rd<-seq(1,length(sydf$date),3)
axis(1,at=sydf$date[every3rd],labels=sydf$monthday[every3rd])

Subject: [R] bizarre color space conversion problem
Message-ID: <CAM_vjumrVeZagQ+Ckyy-zSXkiVquPSdf8idm_PES3uon2RBydg@mail.gmail.com>

I am getting unexpected results when converting from RGB to Lab. This
is clearly some kind of configuration problem, but I cannot find it. I
have three linux workstations, both fully updated (except all are
running R 3.6.0 instead of 3.6.1, because that's the latest Fedora 30
binary). I'm running R --vanilla from the command line. On one
workstation, it functions correctly; on the other two the conversion
malfunctions as below.

I found it when my scico color palettes were wildly wrong, but it
isn't a scico package problem.
https://twitter.com/numberwright/status/1151601407436439554

After spending far too much time poking at it, I'm still curious as to
what might be going on. It's got to be my computer rather than R, but
I do want to figure out what, in case it has consequences for other
calculations.

Here's my sample code:

red.in <- rep("red", 20)

red.rgb   <- t(col2rgb(red.in, alpha = 0)/255)
red.lab   <- convertColor(red.rgb, from = "sRGB", to = "Lab")
convertColor(red.lab, from = "Lab", to = "sRGB")

#-#-#

Output on computer A, as expected:

I've gotten as far as locating the problem in this line from
grDevices::convertColor()

    xyz <- from$toXYZ(color, from.ref.white)


Packages are up to date on all computers, although this doesn't
involve any contributed packages.

Thoughts?

Note that you can reproduce this in R-3.5.1 if you specify serialization
version 3 (which became the default in 3.6.0).

If you use version=3, ascii=TRUE and look at the file made up to the point
of the error, you can see a quasi-infinite repeat of a block of 165 numbers
(after a deferred string called "base"?).  Looks like inappropriate
recursion.

This is, indeed, bizzare!

So if you manually feed the arguments:

to the function:

grDevices::colorspaces[['Lab']][['toXYZ']](Lab, white)

Do you get the same result on all three computers?

If you debugonce(grDevices::colorspaces[['Lab']][['toXYZ']]), then
try to convertColor(red.lab, from = "Lab", to = "sRGB"), are the
arguments Lab and white the same on all three computers?

Subject: [R] Dataframe columns are accessible by incomplete column names,
 is this a bug?
Message-ID: <e2c3cfe6e29f498da4b4d445dd2e3f45@svrm2ex2k13n01.hs.coop.ch>

Hello all
I noticed today that you can access dataframe columns by using incomplete names. This is a really unexpected behavior which led to some unexpected errors and I was wondering whether it's a bug or not and whether it should be changed in the future.
Here's a working example using the preinstalled "swiss" dataset:

> head(swiss)
             Fertility Agriculture Examination Education Catholic
Courtelary        80.2        17.0          15        12     9.96

Moutier           85.8        36.5          12         7    33.77
Neuveville        76.9        43.5          17        15     5.16
Porrentruy        76.1        35.3           9         7    90.57
             Infant.Mortality
Courtelary               22.2
Delemont                 22.2

So in order to access the column "Examination", I can type any substring from "Ex" to "Examination" and will always get the column swiss$Examination.

Thanks for reading and Greetings
Yannick Suter

Something about the deferred string conversion object in

a <- names(attributes(apresX)[[4]][[1]][[1]])

is malformed; .Internal(inspect(a)) also infinite loops.
Will try to narrow this down.

I didn't include enough detail, despite the length of my original
email. The problem is in the conversion from RGB to Lab. I converted
it back to RGB because most of us are more familiar with that. Below
are the intermediate steps.

And to make it even more bizarre, it fails with eight or more colors,
but works correctly with seven or fewer.

Ivan's suggestion works fine; the Lab to RGB conversion is okay. I
tried to figure out how colorspaces() works, but couldn't get it to
agree with convertColors(), although they're both reversible using the
same function.

red.rgb

red.lab   <- convertColor(red.rgb, from = "sRGB", to = "Lab")

Hello Yannick,

That behavior is documented in the help for subsetting ( ?'$' ):

     Both ?[[? and ?$? select a single element of the list.  The main
     difference is that ?$? does not allow computed indices, whereas
     ?[[? does.  ?x$name? is equivalent to ?x[["name", exact =
     FALSE]]?.  Also, the partial matching behavior of ?[[? can be
     controlled using the ?exact? argument.

You can avoid it by using [[]] instead:

> swiss[['Ex']]
NULL
> head(swiss[['Examination']])
[1] 15  6  5 12 17  9

That's one of the major reasons using $ is sometimes discouraged.

Hmm. Assuming defaults and skipping all checks, convertColor(red.rgb,
from = "sRGB", to = "Lab") amounts to the following:

red.rgb <- t(col2rgb(rep('red',8), alpha = 0)/255)
# let's hope this implementation detail wasn't changed in 3.6.1
white.point <- grDevices:::c2to3(grDevices:::white.points[,'D65'])
(red.xyz <- grDevices::colorspaces$sRGB$toXYZ(red.rgb, white.point))[1,]
# [1] 0.4168213 0.2149235 0.0195385
(red.lab <- grDevices::colorspaces$Lab$fromXYZ(red.xyz,white.point))[1,] #        L        a        b
# 53.48418 80.01027 67.38407
convertColor(red.rgb, from = "sRGB", to = "Lab")[1,]
#        L        a        b
# 53.48418 80.01027 67.38407

Does the manual way result in a different output? If so, do the
differences appear in red.xyz or red.lab?

grDevices::colorspaces$sRGB$toXYZ is pretty simple, just a matrix
product.  (I hope there are no differences in
as.list(environment(grDevices::colorspaces$sRGB$toXYZ))[c('dogamma','M')]
on different computers - that would be strange.)
grDevices::colorspaces$Lab$fromXYZ looks more complicated but is just a
bunch of vectorised element-wise algebra, so tracing the intermediate
results should also be possible.

This is just a wild guess, but could /usr/lib64/R/lib/libRblas.so per
chance be a symlink to an OpenBLAS copy? Could any of the computers
exhibiting the bizarre behaviour be equipped with an AVX-512-capable
CPU?

But it's also a convenience feature. Note that $E returned null
because there was an ambiguity. By the time you got to $Ex the column
you were referencing was unambiguous and you didn't have to type out
the whole thing. Useful if you have very long column names, for
example imported from a spreadsheet.

That said, I agree that relying on it can be risky.

Also, please use plain-text to post to this list. Your table would
have been much easier to read.

I'll address all of your questions below, but starting with this:

> Could any of the computers
exhibiting the bizarre behaviour be equipped with an AVX-512-capable
CPU?

Yes. Both computers that are giving the bizarre results have Intel
i9-7900X CPUs; the X-series apparently is AVX-512-capable.

That would be an incredibly disturbing cause... But I can't find
anything else that differs. They're using the same BLAS.

I'm not even remotely a hardware expert: if the difference is due to
changes in the instruction set, I assume that has potential
consequences for other things, and I just happened to spot it in this
particular case because it's visualization-based? (Yikes.)

I really appreciate your suggestions, by the way. Thanks!


Here's a complete rundown:



As it says in my first email (but way at the bottom), I'd already
gotten as far as locating the problem in this line from
grDevices::convertColor()

    xyz <- from$toXYZ(color, from.ref.white)

Your test code confirms that as the source of the problem:

No, that's identical on working and nonworking computers. (Whew!)

Yes, this might be bad. I have heard about OpenBLAS (specifically, the
matrix product routine) misbehaving on certain AVX-512 capable
processors, so much that they had to disable some optimizations in
0.3.6 [*], which you already have installed. Still, would `env
OPENBLAS_CORETYPE=Haswell R --vanilla` give a better result?

Thanks for confirming this! It felt that I had to make sure, since the
behaviour we observe is so confusing.

One last check: would

red.rgb %*% as.list(environment(grDevices::colorspaces$sRGB$toXYZ))$M

still produce different results on your computers?

I do not know enough about Fedora's "alternatives" system, but it does
look like R is using OpenBLAS.

Again, this points in the direction of OpenBLAS not doing AVX-512 math
properly. Let's hope that OPENBLAS_CORETYPE=Haswell solves it.

Thanks Jim,

I appreciate that you spend so much time helping me on this.
I translated your code to use my plot_ly function this way, I'm not sure if this is correct, but tried to match your x and y axis and the labels. Here is the complete code including data below, but it seems like my code "ticktext =" is ignored, and it still shows the years in the x axis as labels:

sydf<-read.table(text="year monthday rate
 1993 05-01 0.608
 1994 06-01 0.622
 1996 07-01 0.623
 1998 08-01 0.647
 2000 09-01 0.646
 2002 10-01 0.625
 2004 11-01 0.628
 2006 12-01 0.685
 2008 01-01 0.679
 2010 02-01 0.595
 2012 03-01 0.567
 2014 04-01 0.599
 2016 05-01 0.642
 2018 06-01 0.685",
                 header=TRUE,
                 stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

sydf$date<-as.Date(paste(sydf$year,sydf$monthday),"%Y %m-%d")
every3rd<-seq(1,length(sydf$date),3)

library(plotly)
plot_ly(sydf,
        x = ~date,
        y = ~rate,
        type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines') %>%
  layout(
    xaxis = list(
      ticktext = sydf$monthday[every3rd],
      tickvals = sydf$year,
      tickmode = "array",
      tickangle = 270
    ))


Thanks,
Steven

Hi Steven,
I caved in and installed plotly. Not an easy task. When I tried your example, I got a blank HTML page displayed. I then created a plot with your data above showing every third monthday label. If this is what you want, maybe the way I have coded it will work in plotly.

sydf$date<-as.Date(paste(sydf$year,sydf$monthday),"%Y %m-%d")
plot(sydf$date,sydf$rate,type="l",xaxt="n")
every3rd<-seq(1,length(sydf$date),3)
axis(1,at=sydf$date[every3rd],labels=sydf$monthday[every3rd])

Wow. You are entirely correct. I would not have been able to pinpoint
the problem, or how to test it. Thank you.

I am unhappy you are right, since these are the fast workstations I
use for all of my heavy-duty analysis, and it's not even *possible* to
rerun everything.

Oh dear.

Here, with the options you suggested, it produces the expected results:

# env OPENBLAS_CORETYPE=Haswell R --vanilla

I have confirmed that a complete workaround to these problems is available if, as Bill Dunlap suggested, "version=2" is used in all *save* incantations. 

Thanks Bill!

Sarah, if you haven't done so already, please do us (OpenBLAS users) a
big favor and report the bug, either to Fedora or directly to OpenBLAS
maintainers.

Peter, it appears to be the same as this bug:

https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/2168

I added my info to the discussion.

Thanks for the reminder.

And thank you again to Ivan for the help.

Message-ID: <CAPQaxLO4qWcfekeLxYZBLe1i7oLkphDxE0ud9t9kA7C-3-J-MQ@mail.gmail.com>

 Good evening,

  I am dealing with an already analyzed  .RData file consisting of
pre-configured data objects loaded into my environment. I am attempting to
take this data, which shows an overall correlation of survival with
methylation pattern for a form of brain cancer, and go to the individual
probe sets and see if MGMT is one of the genes whose methylation show an
association with survival. To do this I am under the impression that I have
to visualize the probesets in order to view them/determine what gene or
genes (unbiasedly) show an association between meth. and survival. I have
been trying to run a few different methods such as microarray probe set
mapping through Ensembl, but without avail.
Would anyone perhaps know of a procedure/workflow that I could use to
achieve this?

Best,

Spencer

This query should almost certainly be posted on the Bioconductor Help site
rather than here. Especially so as it is a general question about a
genomics "workflow" rather than a question about R programming.

That will mask this particular symptom, but the real problem is that
the C++ code in the package is mutating an object that it should
duplicate first. I'm not sure if the problem should be addressed in
the package or in Rcpp, but one of the two should be fixed.

The specific problem is in the source file
apcluster/src/aggExClusterC.cpp lines 160-161:

         IntegerVector newClust = concat(actClust[I], actClust[J]);
         newClust.names() = CharacterVector(newClust);

The call CharacterVector(newClust) produced a deferred string object
for newClust and marks newClust as immutable, but the assignment
ignores that and mutates anyway. I have CC'd the maintainers of
apcluster and Rcpp.

We may be able to make serialize() and .Internal(inspect()) a bit more
robust to this sort of misbehavior in package space, but as more
optimizations are added package authors who use native code will need
to be more careful about adhering to the rules for when objects can be
safely modified.

Best,

luke

Message-ID: <BN7PR05MB58579ACEA4060DE98DBCA1FDCACB0@BN7PR05MB5857.namprd05.prod.outlook.com>

Here is a toy example of what I want

library(lattice)
result <- data.frame(score = 1:10, theta = seq(from = -5, to = 5, length = 10))
result$theta2 <- result$theta + .3
xyplot(score ~ theta + theta2, result,  type = c('g', 'l'))

However, in reality, the number of variables along the x-axis will vary in unknown ways. So, I collect them in a matrix, similar to something like

thetaMat <- cbind(result$theta, result$theta2)

I recall at one point being able to pass a matrix of some form, such as
xyplot(score ~ thetaMat[,1:ncol(thetaMat)], result, type = c('g', 'l'))

This fails, and I am cannot recall the right usage for doing this without having to stack the columns (which I'm hoping to avoid).

Can anyone suggest the right usage for this concept?

Thanks

Harold

Message-ID: <CAPQaxLNv7A_8Qo5Tw7qLqhNE5i73krhkmR420Eqz6Rgtdxz6Kg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

  I am trying to create a data set from an object called ?anno? in my
environment. I?ve tried arguments like saveRDS(anno, file = ??) and
save(anno, file ?.RData?) to save the object as a file to see if that will
work, but it seems for the particular procedure I am trying to carry out, I
need to transpose the object to a data set. Any ideas as to how I might do
this? For reference, my next step in manipulating the data contained in the
object is data(), which evidently does not work for reading in data frame
objects as data(?file/object name).

Best,

Spencer

Hi Spencer,

Your description doesn't make any sense to me. If anno is already an R
object, what are you trying to do with it?

data() is for loading datasets that come with packages; if your object
is already an R object in your environment, then there's no need for
it.

It sounds like you are possibly working through an example provided
elsewhere, that has sample data loaded with data(). If so, then you do
not need that step for your own data. You just need to import it into
R in the correct format.

If that doesn't help, then I think we need more information on what
you're trying to do.

Sarah,

  I am trying to extract phenoData (ie sample information) from the object
as part of a procedure to analyze my array for probe sets, which I realize
is under the BioConducter package Biobase and not relevant to this mailing
list.

  Yes the original procedure uses data from the Dilution dataset hosted in
the AffyBatch package affydata. Previous to this part of the procedure, a
dataset was create via..

  >fake.data <- matrix(rnorm(8*200), ncol=8)
##Then phenotype (sample) data was generated in this example through... ##

  sample.info <- data.frame( + spl=paste('A', 1:8, sep=''), +
stat=rep(c('cancer' , 'healthy'), each=4))

##Then a meta data.frame object was created to give more intelligible
labels##

> meta.info <- data.frame (labelDescription = + c('Sample Name' , 'Cancer
Status')) Then we put them all together: > pheno <-
new("AnnotatedDataFrame", + data = sample.info, + varMetadata = meta.info)

##Which was then aggregated together##

> pheno <- new("AnnotatedDataFrame", + data = sample.info, + varMetadata =
meta.info)

  >my.experiments <- new("ExpressionSet", + exprs=fake.data,
phenoData=pheno)
   > my.experiments
ExpressionSet (storageMode: lockedEnvironment) assayData: 200 features, 8
samples element names: exprs

##The following deals with further manipulating the phenoData##
phenoData
   sampleNames: 1, 2, ..., 8 (8 total) varLabels and varMetadata
description: spl: Sample Name stat: Cancer Status

featureData
 featureNames: 1, 2, ..., 200 (200 total) fvarLabels and fvarMetadata
description: none
experimentData:  use 'experimentData(object)'
Annotation:

##At this point is when the dataset 'Dilution was read in through
data(Dilution)

which was made an object of the AnnotatedDataFrame via

>phenoData(Dilution)

My apologies in advance as I know the above info. pertains to functions
carried out strictly through BioConducor, but is the only context I can
provide for what I am trying to do.

Best,

Spencer

Right. If you have some equivalent to the Dilution dataset, then you
need to get it into R in the appropriate way for whatever data you
have.

data() is merely a way to get stored R data into your R session.
There's no reason you need to use data() rather than read.table() or
whatever is appropriate for the data you have available.

Or if you needed that exact dataset, data(Dilution) would get it into
your R session.

Do look at ?data if you haven't already.

Sarah,

Thank you for the reference to ?data. Upon further research into the
matter, I think I can provide a simpler explanation than the one previously
provided. I am trying to reproduce the following code with an object --
'anno' -- in my data frame/environment.

  >fake.data <- matrix(rnorm(8*200), ncol=8)

I found the number of columns with >ncol(anno)  , which is 3

How do I find rnorm when I don't have the data table (saved as the 'anno'
object) mean or standard dev. ?

I will try reading in the data object through read.table() now, though
won't that just print the data or a subset thereof into my R console?

You don't need fake.data or rnorm(), which was used to generate the fake data.

You need to use your real data for the analysis, not anything randomly
generated for example purposes, or anything included with a package
for example purposes.

In both cases, those are just worked examples.You need to analyze your
own comparable data.

Okay. I am a little confused as to how to proceed with that. The next part
of the procedure as seen below appears to be substituting information from
this fake data set into the following arguments in order to

 sample.info <- data.frame( + spl=paste('A', 1:8, sep=''), +
stat=rep(c('cancer' , 'healthy'), each=4))

##Then a meta data.frame object was created to give more intelligible
labels##

> meta.info <- data.frame (labelDescription = + c('Sample Name' , 'Cancer
Status')) Then we put them all together: > pheno <-
new("AnnotatedDataFrame", + data = sample.info, + varMetadata = meta.info)

##Which was then aggregated together##

> pheno <- new("AnnotatedDataFrame", + data = sample.info, + varMetadata =
meta.info)

  >my.experiments <- new("ExpressionSet", + exprs=fake.data,
phenoData=pheno)
   > my.experiments
ExpressionSet (storageMode: lockedEnvironment) assayData: 200 features, 8
samples element names: exprs

##The following deals with further manipulating the phenoData##
phenoData
   sampleNames: 1, 2, ..., 8 (8 total) varLabels and varMetadata
description: spl: Sample Name stat: Cancer Status

featureData
   featureNames: 1, 2, ..., 200 (200 total)
   fvarLabels and fvarMetadata description: none
experimentData:  use 'experimentData(object)'
Annotation:

##At this point is when the dataset 'Dilution' was read in through
data(Dilution)

 >library(affydata)
 > data(Dilution)

which was made an object of the AnnotatedDataFrame via
>Dilution
>phenoData(Dilution)
>pData(Dilution)

##To access the probesets###

 > geneNames(Dilution)[1:3] [1] "100_g_at" "1000_at" "1001_at"

> # random.affyid <- '34803_at'
> ps <- probeset(Dilution, random.affyid)[[1]]

How would I substitute in my anno object to achieve this?

Sarah,

Okay. I am a little confused about how to proceed. How do I substitute my
anno object for the Dilution dataset, when in these following lines of the
code, as it appears that info from the fake dataset was extracted.. ?

stat=rep(c('cancer' , 'healthy'), each=4))

Okay, at this point I have three suggestions, because you're clearly
not yet understanding the R workflow.

1. Read at least the Intro to R manual.
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf
2. Go through your sample code carefully, step by step, using
functions like str() and head() to look at the R objects produced at
each step, using ? to investigate functions you aren't familiar with,
and thinking as you go how those R objects do and don't resemble the
data you have.
3. If 1 and 2 don't help, you need to consult with your advisor,
mentor, or if there's nobody local to you that can help, the author of
the sample code you're using.

I don't have your sample code, don't have your data, am not familiar
with the specific functions you are using, and don't have time to
become familiar. You need to both improve your R understanding and
seek out guidance, ideally from someone whose job it is to help you.

Best,
Sarah

Subject: [R] Check to see if a value is included within intervals
Message-ID: <VI1PR07MB6381072984D70F108BC927D8E2CB0@VI1PR07MB6381.eurprd07.prod.outlook.com>

Hello all,

The R code below tests if values of the variable ?t? are included or not within intervals that are defined from the data frame dat. The expected results are displayed using the function "rle" (see code below). Here is the code:

ta <- 100
tb <- 140
tc <- 40
td <- 85

datF <- data.frame(t = 1:3650, e = NA)
dat <- data.frame(a = seq(1, 3650, 365),
                  b = seq(ta, 3650, 365),
                  c = seq(ta + 1, 3650, 365),
                  d = seq(ta + tb, 3650, 365),
                  e = seq(ta + tb +1, 3650, 365),
                  f = seq(ta + tb + tc, 3650, 365),
                  g = seq(ta + tb + tc + 1, 3650, 365),
                  h = seq(ta + tb + tc + td, 3650, 365))

datF$e <- ifelse((datF$t %in% unlist(Map(`:`, dat$a, dat$b))), 1,
                 ifelse((datF$t %in% unlist(Map(`:`, dat$e, dat$f))), -1, 0))

## Validation
y <- rle(datF$e)
y$lengths[y$values==1]
y$lengths[y$values==0]
y$lengths[y$values==-1]


The code works but I would like to obtain the same results without using data frames and the function ?Map?. Here is an example:

a <- 100
b <- 140
c <- 40
d <- 85
y1 <- a + b + c + d

t1 <- seq(1, y1*10, 1)
t2 <- t1/y1 - floor(t1/y1)
p1 <- a/y1
p2 <- p1 + a/y1
p3 <- p2 + b/y1
p4 <- p3 + c/y1

test <- 1*(t2 <= p1)- 1*(t2 > p2)*(t2 <= p3)

## Validation
y <- rle(test)
y$lengths[y$values==1]
y$lengths[y$values==0]
y$lengths[y$values==-1]

Using this code, the results are not correct.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Many thanks
Marine

If I understand correctly (make sure that I do!), ?findInterval should
essentially do what you want.

In your example (thanks!), I assume that:
1) The cutpoints defining your intervals are increasing, so p1 < p2 < p3
(p4 is unused)
2) You want to know which t2's are in the two intervals t2 <= p1  and p2 <
t2 <= p3.

If that is correct,

fi <- findInterval(t2, c(p1, p2, p3))

will give you a vector of 0's, 1's, 2's, and 3's. Indices with 0's are
those for which t2 <= p1. Indices with 2's are those for which p2 <t2 <=
p3.   1's are for indices with p1 <t2 <= p2  and 3's are for those t2's >
p3.

Function parameters can control whether intervals are open or closed on
left and/or right.

Cheers,
Bert

Thank you very much Bert for your answer. I would like reproduce the same results as the code below:

ta <- 100
tb <- 140
tc <- 40
td <- 85

datF <- data.frame(t = 1:3650, e = NA)
dat <- data.frame(a = seq(1, 3650, 365),
                  b = seq(ta, 3650, 365),
                  c = seq(ta + 1, 3650, 365),
                  d = seq(ta + tb, 3650, 365),
                  e = seq(ta + tb +1, 3650, 365),
                  f = seq(ta + tb + tc, 3650, 365),
                  g = seq(ta + tb + tc + 1, 3650, 365),
                  h = seq(ta + tb + tc + td, 3650, 365))

datF$e <- ifelse((datF$t %in% unlist(Map(`:`, dat$a, dat$b))), 1,
                 ifelse((datF$t %in% unlist(Map(`:`, dat$e, dat$f))), -1, 0))

To reproduce these results, I would like to use a code that looks like the code below (i.e., without data frames and R functions):
a <- 100
b <- 140
c <- 40
d <- 85
y1 <- a + b + c + d

t1 <- seq(1, y1*10, 1)
t2 <- t1/y1 - floor(t1/y1)
p1 <- a/y1
p2 <- p1 + a/y1
p3 <- p2 + b/y1
p4 <- p3 + c/y1

test <- 1*(t2 <= p1)- 1*(t2 > p2)*(t2 <= p3)

Thank you very much for your help.
Have a nice day
Marine

There is no reason for you to tell anyone on this list how they should accomplish your goal... we are not a free (or paid) programming service.

If you are in fact obligated to use your  proposed approach, then you are most likely doing homework and this list is expressly not for homework (re-read the Posting Guide).

If you are doing this on your own then go now and experiment with the findInterval function that Bert suggested. We are here to offer you guidance and you need to do the learning yourself.

Subject: [R] CoxPH multivariate frailty model with coxph (survival)
Message-ID: <CAJfThnQjEWXndTCYroqg39OjdE6vpUdRNR-3SrHE0_-=afD00A@mail.gmail.com>

 Dear R users,

I am interested in estimating the effects of a treatment on two
time-to-event traits (on simulated data), accounting for the dependency
between the two time-to-event outcomes.

I precise that the events are NOT recurrent, NOT competitive, NOT ordered.
The individuals are NOT related and can have 0, 1 or the 2 events (in any
ordered).

So, I specified a time-to-event model with one Cox PH hazard function for
each outcome.
The two hazard functions are linked by a common subject-specific frailty
term (gamma distribution) to account for the dependency. The likelihood
function of that model would include two risks sets (1 for eachoutcome)
connected via the shared frailty term.

To fit that model, I used the coxph function (survival R package, T.
Thernaud):
coxph( Surv(Time, Status) ~ treatment*Event_type + strata(Event_type) +
frailty(ID), data=example)
- where example is my dataset, with 2*N individuals (2 rows for each
individual, corresponding to each time-to-event outcome)
- Time = c(Time_outcome1, Time_outcome2)
- Status=c(Event_outcome1, Event_outcome2)
- Event_type=c(rep(0,length(Time_outcome1)),rep(1,length(Time_outcome2))
- ID=c(ID,ID)

So, the model implies different baseline hazard function for each outcome
(argument strata) and estimate a treatment effect for each event type(
treatment*Event_type).

Although the model returns some estimates close to what I expected
(simulation study), the problem is that most of the examples I found with
this type of formulation are for competitive time-to-event models (as
presented in Therneau's and Grambush's book "Modeling survival
data"  (pages 240-260 and 175-185) and also in some info I found on
internet).

So, I am wondering if some of you have the same or different interpretation
of mime.
Otherwise do you have other functions to recommend me to fit the desired
model, such as coxme...? I also checked the package " mets" which also
describes several examples for competitive time-to-event traits, but not
for NON competitive events.

Thanks in advance for your help,
Denise

Hi Spencer,
While Sarah has already given you very good advice, there is a rough
method of checking whether one data set can be substituted for
another:

str(anno)
str(Dilution)

If you're lucky and the objects are not too complicated, this will
give you a start on whether one can be substituted for the other. For
example, if one is a vector and the other is a complicated list of
lists, forget it. If the two STRuctures look pretty much the same,
you've got a chance.

Subject: [R] How to create the/an integer 'seed' for set.seed() from a given
 .Random.seed?
Message-ID: <CAM3-KjYgdnEvKL=CTievozTKPPOe2mVay2Cz7misUxKY6uT76A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

1) Given .Random.seed, how can one compute *the* integer 'seed' such
that set.seed(seed) generates .Random.seed?
2) If 1) is not possible, how can one compute *an* integer 'seed' from
a given .Random.seed such that different .Random.seed's are guaranteed
to give different integers 'seed' (or at least with a very high
probability)? In other words, how can one construct an injective
function from .Random.seed objects to an integer?

(In an ideal world, this would work for all kinds of random number generators).

What I found out (... is not very much so far):
./src/main/names.c -> do_setseed() -> RNG.c -> RNG_Init() leads to (at
least for the Mersenne Twister)...
for(j = 0; j < RNG_Table[kind].n_seed; j++) {
    seed = (69069 * seed + 1);
    RNG_Table[kind].i_seed[j] = seed;
}
FixupSeeds(kind, 1);
... which gives some hope that the first entry in RNG_Table can be
used to access 'seed' (which could be the 3rd value of .Random.seed in
this case, but I'm not sure...).

Background (or 'why on earth would you...'): I have a function myRNG
of the following form (body explains the non-minimal problem):
myRNG <- function(n, method, ...) {
      if(method = "A") {
          <All random numbers I generate in here respect a global
'set.seed(seed)'
  command ('global' in the sense of calling set.seed() before calling 'myRNG').
  In particular, different 'seed' arguments of set.seed() correctly
  lead to different random numbers.>
      } else {
          <In here I'm calling a function 'obscure' from another package (which
  also generates some random numbers). Unfortunately, 'obscure' does not
  respect a global 'set.seed(seed)' (different 'seed' arguments to
  set.seed() always lead to the same outputs of 'obscure'). Luckily,
  'obscure' accepts an argument 'seed', so one can set a seed inside
  'obscure'. However, this argument 'seed' needs to be an integer.
  So if 1) or 2) above can be solved, I can use a global set.seed()
  and guarantee that different 'seed' arguments to set.seed() lead
  to different outputs of 'myRNG' also for this method (!= "A").>
      }
}

Thanks & cheers,
Marius

Subject: [R] Capturing positive and negative changes using R
Message-ID: <8BD60129-115E-418B-8A01-E2CB0D23D72D@gmail.com>

Dear R-users, 

I have a country-year data for 180 countries from 1970 to 2010. I?m interested in capturing positive and negative changes in some of the variables. Some of these variables are continuous (0,25, 0,33, 1, 1,5 etc) others are ordered (0,1, 2). 

To do this, I use this code data$X1_change<- +c(FALSE,diff(data$X1))    

My data looks something like this (please see below).

There?re some problems with this code:  (1) I can?t capture the smaller changes, say from 0,25 to 0,33 ( I get weird numbers). I would love to get the exact difference ( for ex: +1, -0,22, +4, -2 etc).  (2) It can?t make difference between countries. That is, it takes the difference between countries while it should only do this for each country ( for ex: when the US ends in 2011, and Canada starts, it counts this a difference but it shouldn?t, see below). (3) NAs, missing values, is neither a positive or negative change, although it does think that what comes after the NA is a difference. 

 So, I wonder if anyone here can help me to adjust this code. I appreciate all comments.

Hello,

Please don't post in HTML, the data is unreadable.

Two ideas:
1) Why c(FALSE, diff()) if diff returns numeric values? Use c(0, diff) 
instead, and you won't need the coercion to numeric with the plus sign.
2) There are many ways to group by a variable, in this case 'Country'. 
See in base R

?aggregate
?tapply
?ave
?by

And there's also contributed packages, such as dplyr and data.table.


If you can repost your data, setting your e-mail client to plain text, 
we will be able to say more.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Subject: [R] List of tables needed
Message-ID: <CAPL76w8ZySXq8xVcCT=+sZ_+NcYcm0TtVtq1UTmBY18o67Vy+w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,


My name is Jackson and I need a help in applying functions to a list of
tables.


Could anyone help me to use loop/array on a list of tables ?

I need to apply a group of functions (listed below) to a list of tables

I am not that good with loops or arrays or multiple functions.

So, could some of you help me ?


mylist <- list.files(full.names = F, pattern =".asc$")

mylist

[1] table1.asc" " table2.asc"
[3] " table3.asc" " table4.asc  "
[5] " table5.asc  "

The <https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/the?source=feed_text&epa=HASHTAG>
following
functions should be applied to each table from mylist

######

in.r=read.table(mylist,sep="",skip=7,header=F)

cl=read.table(mylist,sep="",nrows=1,header=F)

rw=read.table(mylist,sep="",nrows=1,skip=1,header=F)

xll=read.table(mylist,sep="",nrows=1,skip=2,header=F)

yll=read.table(mylist,sep="",nrows=1,skip=3,header=F)

It is possible that part of the original problem was that Fardadj was expecting R to recognise the comma as the decimal and he read in that column as a factor without realizing it. Factors are discrete, not continuous.

He should use the str() function to identify the column types in his data frame.

If "Fardadj was expecting R to recognise the comma as the decimal"
then it might be worth mentioning the 'dec = "."' argument of
read.table and its friends.

See also the"Intro to R" tutorial that ships with R. We(or at least I)
expect you to do your own homework learning basic R before posting here.
This is not a substitute for such efforts, but we are willing to help when
you get stuck. See the posting guide linked below and show us your own
coding efforts.

I'm not accepting the task of writing out your full project for you, but 
instead will offer a game plan:

Steps to take:

-initialize empty? lists for each type of input dataset named `in.r`, 
`cl` , etc.

 ?? #e.g.

 ?? in.r <- list()

1) start for loop indexed by: ?? f_n = seq_along(mylist)

2) put your read.table lines inside the for-loop body with the LHS of 
the assignment having the list name indexed by the for-loop variable.

 ?? #e.g.:

 ???? in.r[f_n]=read.table(mylist[f_n], sep="", skip=7, header=F)

# and do learn to use spaces liberally in code

3) terminate the for-loop.

4) in the future use `library()` calls to load whatever packages have 
non-base functions (eg, `raster`)

Best of luck;

David

I'm having a little trouble believing what I'm seeing.
To the best of my knowledge,
sample.info <- data.frame( + spl=paste('A', 1:8, sep=''), +
stat=rep(c('cancer' , 'healthy'), each=4))
is not legal R syntax, and R 3.6.1 agrees with me
Error: unexpected '=' in "x <- data.frame(+ spl="

Then I see  + c('Sample Name' , 'Cancer
Status')
which R doesn't like either, for obvious reasons.
Error in +c("Sample Name", "Cancer\nStatus") :
  invalid argument to unary operator

Are you sure all these + signs are in your actual code?
What do you expect them to do?

No, read.table() *isn't* about printing.
If you have data stored as text in a tabular format,
you use read.data, read.csv, read.csv2, read.delim, or read.delim2
to read it.  This returns a new data frame.  Example:
> x <- read.table(textConnection(c(
+ "A B",
+ "1 2",
+ "3 4")), TRUE)

> x
  A B
1 1 2
2 3 4

Reading the table and storing it in x does not result in anything being
printed.
It's asking for the value of an expression that gets you printout.

Here is one more option using the ave() function. Using Jim's data and 
naming convention

fkdf$X1_change <- ave(fkdf[,'X1'], fkdf$Country, FUN=function(x) 
c(0,diff(x)))
fkdf$X2_change <- ave(fkdf[,'X2'], fkdf$Country, FUN=function(x) 
c(0,diff(x)))

hope this is helpful,

Dan

Thank you much, this was very helpful. Jim?s and Daniel?s code was spot on. 

Indeed, as Jeff Newmiller pointed out,  one of the problems was that I assumed that R could recognise decimals - I did as Richard O?Keefe suggested and the problem was gone. 

Thanks again!

Subject: [R] Printing vector
Message-ID: <7cb890e7-99dc-ccfe-22e4-7af56b909b19@hqu.edu.cn>

Is there a convenient way to print a vector into rows of a specified 
column length? What I need is to print in the old FORTRAN format, viz.,

format(10F8.2)

which would print, for instance, a vector of 25 into two rows of 10 plus 
an incomplete row of 5. I managed to write a procedure for that task, as 
shown below (except that I prefer simply blanks rather than the NA). I 
am too embarrassed to even show the procedure. In short, I like to print 
in the above FORTRAN format. Thank you.

Dear All:

Below is what I meant. Procedure print0 allows me to print a vector of 
length 53 in four rows of 10 plus 1 row of 3 (Ido not like the NA). This 
is silly. I am hoping that there is a candid way to print the matrix. 
Thank you.

Hello,

Maybe something like the following is what you want.
I have added an extra argument 'fill' to allow to choose what to print 
in the end. It's default value is "" making the entire matrix elements 
characters but it can be NA or 0.

print0 <- function(x, len = 10, digits = 2, fill = ""){
   n <- length(x)
   x <- round(x, digits = digits)
   passes <- n %/% len
   remainder <- n %% len
   A <- matrix(fill, nrow = passes + (remainder > 0), ncol = len)
   for(i in seq_len(passes)){
     A[i, ] <- x[(len*(i - 1) + 1):(len*i)]
   }
   A[nrow(A), 1:remainder] <- x[(len*passes + 1):n]
   A
}

print0(rnorm(23), 10)
print0(rnorm(23), 10, fill = 0)


Hope this helps,

Simpler, no loops:


print0b <- function(x, len = 10, digits = 2, fill = ""){
   n <- length(x)
   x <- round(x, digits = digits)
   m <- n %/% len
   remainder <- n %% len
   A <- matrix(x[seq_len(len*m)], ncol = len)
   if(remainder > 0){
     A <- rbind(A, c(x[(len*m + 1):n], rep(fill, len*(m + 1) - n)))
   }
   A
}

Hello Team,

This mail is in reference to understanding R  license and also usage of  R
language to develop commercialised product.

I am working on one product of mine that uses R and python language.I am
trying to understand the licensing issue if any related to R, if I am going
to commercialise my product and keep my work proprietary.

I need your help to understand it. R comes under GNU-GPL-2.0. Now, do I
need to share source code of my product. if, I am moving planning  to move
it to production or I can keep my code Proprietary.

Please note that I am just using R and its packages to  develop my own
statistical tool and api and Have not done any changes to existing R code.

Please refer below for all R-packages used in my code:-

   1.

You're in the wrong place. This is for help with R programming.

But you shouldn't be asking us either way, as we (at least most of us)
aren't lawyers. Get your attorney to study the GNU-GPL-2.0 and tell
you what you need to and can do for your purposes.

Hi,

In addition to Patrick's comments, which are spot on, other versions of the GPL (e.g. 3.0) and other GPL compatible licenses that are or may be relevant to the list of packages that are listed below need to be assessed as well. There are differences, some more nuanced than others, between GPL compatible licenses and how they may affect what you can or cannot do.

If you are going to build a presumably for profit business around open source software, then you need to invest in legal counsel with expertise in the relevant areas of open source software and intellectual property rights, to get appropriate legal opinions on what it is you plan to build, how it will interact with R and the packages you list below, and what all of that means for your product.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

By the way, the default print method has the argument 'na.print' that can
speciify how to print an NA value.  E.g.,

> print(c(1234/9999, NA, 1), na.print="n/a")
[1] 0.1234123       n/a 1.0000000
> print(c(1234/9999, NA, 1), na.print="")
[1] 0.1234123           1.0000000
> print(c(1234/9999, NA, 1))
[1] 0.1234123        NA 1.0000000

Your internet skills are pathetic. Search Google for "proprietary use gpl" and the first hit is

https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/7078/is-it-legal-to-use-gpl-code-in-a-proprietary-closed-source-program-by-putting-i

Note that there are (at least) three obvious alternatives if there is any question in your case: release the code under GPL but also sell it with support (a la RStudio); only use it yourself (don't distribute it at all); or only use R for setting up your models but re-engineer implementations of the run-time prediction calculations yourself (often much easier than the initial algorithm development). 

I think your desperation to steal the hard work of the various R contributors seems quite odious.

Hello,

How could I forgot na.print? Thanks, Bill.

This version c no longer has an argument fill and it's the one that 
behaves more like the OP asks for so far.

print0c <- function(x, len = 10, digits = 2){
   n <- length(x)
   x <- round(x, digits = digits)
   fill <- NA
   m <- n %/% len
   remainder <- n %% len
   A <- matrix(x[seq_len(len*m)], ncol = len)
   if(remainder > 0){
     A <- rbind(A, c(x[(len*m + 1):n], rep(fill, len*(m + 1) - n)))
   }
   print(A, na.print = "")
}

print0c(rnorm(23), 10)
print0c(2^(1:23), 10)


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Dear Steven,

The function "write()" has a parameter "columns".
And sprint() can do do some formatting in C style.

x <- rnorm(100)
s <- sprintf( fmt="%8.2f" ,x )
write(s,  file="", ncolumns=7L)

Cheers,
Lei

Thank you, Gentlemen. That serves my need. Bill's routine is great.

Also, Rui: Is there a way to get rid of the filled "NA" and use space 
instead. Using fill = "" does not help either; it causes all numbers to 
be embraced with quotations. Finally, I have no idea why Rui's message 
did not reach me at all (not even in the junk mail box). But, obviously 
Bill had received it. Hmm.

Subject: [R] How to rename file names with condition

Could somebody please help me on this?

I have many files on my computer and would like to change its names so that it would be more meaningful for me. The filenames are in the following format: cvcvcv198307.xlsx

I want to change it in such a way that
cvcvcv into Domain1983 want to keep it?07 into 3-1 * And here is my main problem (Explanation below).


Each month (01-12) is divided into three data points. Meaning,

01(Jan) has three data points: 1, 2, and 3
02(Feb) has the next three data points: 4,5, and 6...12(Dec) will have: 34,35, and 36


So, 01 (last digit in my file name) means, first month, first data point, i.e. 1-1

? ? 02 - First month, and second data point, i.e. 1-2

? ? 03 - First month, third data point, i.e 1-3

? ? 04- second month, first data point, i.e. 2-1

? ? 05- 2-2

? ? 06- 2-3

? ? 07 - 3-1

? ? 08 - 3-2

? ? 09 - 3-3

? ? 10 - 4-1

? ? 11 - 4-2

? ? 12 - 4-3

? ? .

? ? .?

? ? .
? ? ? ?35 - 12-2
? ? ? ?36 - 12-3

And that's all.

I have tried file.rename along with sapply for my whole sets of data

(1:18,000). But i can only manage to change the file names before the last two #digits.

Expected result.

The whole file names changed from


cvcvcv198307.xlsx into Domain1983-3-1.txtcvcvcv198414.xlsx into?Domain1984-5-2.txt




(Yes, file name extension too!)

Thank you guys and I really appreciate any help on this.
Daniel

Assuming you have the vector of .xlsx file names as  oldFilenames

then

newname <- function(oldname) {
  yr <- substr(oldname,7,10)
  m  <- as.numeric(substr(oldname,11,12))
  mo <- as.integer( m/3 + 1 - 0.1 )
  i  <- c(3,1,2)[ m%%3 + 1 ]
  sprintf("Domain%s-%d-%d.txt",yr,mo,i)
}

for ( s in oldFilenames )
   file.rename(s, newname(s) ) }

HTH,
Eric

It's not clear which area is causing you difficulty. Clearly you need to 
be using `gsub` and the `%/% and `%%` functions: This may help on the 
extraction of the month index and modulo arithmetic:


 ?test <- c("cvcvcv198301.xlsx", "cvcvcv198302.xlsx", 
"cvcvcv198303.xlsx", "cvcvcv198304.xlsx", "cvcvcv198305.xlsx", 
"cvcvcv198306.xlsx", "cvcvcv198307.xlsx")
 ?mon <- as.numeric( gsub(".+(\\d{2})\\.xlsx", "\\1",? test) )

 ?(mon +2) %/% 3
#[1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 3

 ?(mon +2) %% 3 +1
#[1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1

You should now have sufficient examples and be able to use `sub` and 
`paste` to modify the file names to suit your requirements.

PLEASE: Read the Posting Guide and only post in plain text. Your code 
will continue to be mangled because the HTML version is stripped by the 
mail server, and teh line breaks get lost.

Nice to see William Dunlap take the trouble to mimic the classic Fortran 
behavior of printing **** for numbers that don't fit in the given width :)

Hi Team

Thank you for your reply. I do not intend to use hard work of community and
earn profit on it. I do not intend to do  any changes or modifications in
existing R source code and build software over it. I am just using R as
language to develop my own work, the same way people use Java or python.

I just got confused with the licensing , as I thought i can't even use R as
a language to write code. But that's not the case right? The problem arises
only if I try to do modification in existing source code and then try to
convert it into proprietary.

I am sorry , it all came out in wrong way.I didn't intended to hurt anyones
sentiment.

I totally love the community and it's work so far. And hope someday , I'll
be have enough knowledge, so that I can  give back to community.

Regards
Anamika

No, that's not right.  The problem comes if you try to distribute copies 
of R or R packages.  You can write things in R and distribute your own 
code any way you like, but you have to be really careful how your users 
get R in order to run your code.  The only rights you have to distribute 
copies of R and other packages come from their licenses.  If you don't 
follow their licenses, you may be in violation of their copyright.

Again, consult an IP lawyer whom you are paying for legal advice.

I think this unfair, certainly the ?odious? comment.  Very many of us
have been able to contribute because supported to do such work
while occupying relatively comfortable academic positions.  In the
process of getting there, we have benefited enormously from the
work of those who have gone before.  I do not know what Anamika?s
position is, but he may well be trying to build a business from a
much less privileged starting point than others of us may have
enjoyed.  In any case, the comment strikes a tone that is out of
place in respectful discourse.

Your internet skills are pathetic. Search Google for "proprietary use gpl" and the first hit is

https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/7078/is-it-legal-to-use-gpl-code-in-a-proprietary-closed-source-program-by-putting-i

Note that there are (at least) three obvious alternatives if there is any question in your case: release the code under GPL but also sell it with support (a la RStudio); only use it yourself (don't distribute it at all); or only use R for setting up your models but re-engineer implementations of the run-time prediction calculations yourself (often much easier than the initial algorithm development).

I think your desperation to steal the hard work of the various R contributors seems quite odious.

The ad hominem comment about Google skills is also out of line. Knowing
what to search for is often not trivial. The problem is magnified if
English isn't your native language.

Your feelings are noted, but my comment about skills was not directed at the person of Anamika but at their skills, so no, it was not ad hominem. 

Regarding the word "odious"... I think that wrapping GPL software in a proprietary blob is ethically flawed, and that word is appropriate regardless of the possible economic disadvantage someone might have who commits that behavior. I have no problem with people generating proprietary blobs of code they wrote combined with supporting code licensed in a way that allows for such use... my employers have paid me to produce such works in the past, but such blobs should rightfully reflect the work input by the programmer and not the massive input by people not being properly compensated for building such an extensive foundation. (Even if the only thing those programmers asked for was that you release your code as well if you use their code.)

Proprietary code is expensive. For a reason. And in the long run it always loses to the commoditization of software. And cheating to delay that outcome is *odious*.

I highly recommend using a language other than R if you don't plan to distribute source code with your software. That will simplify the licensing issue significantly and make distributing the blob much more straightforward.

Jeff:  Your comments are often (almost always?) a bit rough about the 
edges, and on the recipient, but are always cogent.  Although John M. 
has a valid point, I tend to agree with you.  I would say that if you 
want to make money, trying to sell your own software is a bad way to go 
about it, GPL or no GPL.

Rather like being an actor; you will almost surely starve.   The 
difference with actors is that a tiny fraction of them sometimes make 
big bucks.  Whereas, with selling your own software, never.  (And 
*please* don't hold up Bill Gates as a counterexample.  He did not make 
his big bucks by selling his own software.  He made them from wheeling 
and dealing and selling *other people's* software.  E.g. "MSDOS" was 
just a renaming of "QDOS" ("Quick and Dirty Operating System") which 
Gates bought for 50 thousand US dollars.)

cheers,

Rolf

P.S. To Anamika:  Please do not post in HTML.

I disagree.
I don't think the goal of this forum is to dis-incentivise the use of R.

Yes, users are subject to the GPL.
But beyond that, what they do is up to them.

Thank you Lei. I incorporate Bill Dunlap's idea of flagging with FORTRAN 
stars when field width is short. It works great and serves what I need. 
Thank you all.

I love R!

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] Introducing The New Package 'forestRK'
Message-ID: <69912ad7d1ae41a4b0e1b0f9df1e799b@uwaterloo.ca>

Hello,


I am pleased to announce my new package forestRK. The package implements Forest-RK algorithm discussed in the paper "Forest-RK: A New Random Forest Induction Method" by Simon Bernard, Laurent Heutte, Sebastien Adam, 4th International Conference on Intelligent Computing (ICIC), Sep 2008, Shanghai, China, pp.430-437, to various datasets for classification.


Some of the forestRK functions were built based on the discussion:

  https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/168964/building-a-regression-tree-with-r-from-scratch/168967#168967


Examples of functions included in the new forestRK package are (there are 17 functions in total in this package):


1. construct.treeRK: Builds a single decision tree after implementing the RK (random ?K?) algorithm (i.e. builds ?rktree?);


2. pred.treeRK: Makes predictions on the test observations based on the ?rktree? model in question;


3. draw.treeRK: Makes igraph plot of a ?rktree?.


4. forestRK: Builds a Forest-RK model;


5. pred.forestRK: Makes predictions on the test observations by using the Forest-RK algorithm;



6. mds.plot.forestRK: Generate 2D Multi-Dimensional Scaling plot of the test observations, where the test observations are colour coded by their predicted class type indicated in the pred.forestRK object;


7. importance.forestRK: Calculate Gini Importance of each covariate based on a forestRK model;


8. importance.plot.forestRK: Generate Importance ggplot of the covariates.


The forestRK package also provides tools to encode non-numeric dataset into a numeric one via Numeric Encoding or Binary Encoding.


For more information about the new forestRK package, please visit:

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] ceramic - download web map tiles to local cache
Message-ID: <CAAcGz9_jHUaJE9gdRexnzkCfAkuwUpddmWmVPug9ZnaXD1TadQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

There's a new package ceramic to download online imagery tiles.

Download imagery tiles to a local cache and load the data into raster
objects. Facilities  are provided for Amazon 'AWS' terrain
https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/terrain/ and Mapbox images and
terrain https://www.mapbox.com/.

Use of Mapbox requires obtaining an API key and setting it locally,
functions that require this key provide information on doing this if a
valid key is not found.

Tiled imagery may be downloaded and cached by providing a spatial extent in
several possible formats, with optional control over provider, tile type,
format and zoom.  Direct access to load a raster image will trigger the
tile download and caching, if required.

The release 0.6.0 of ceramic is available on CRAN:

https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ceramic

The development repository of ceramic is hosted on GitHub:

https://github.com/hypertidy/ceramic

Thank you.

Here's one way to phrase your reply:

"I'd recommend you search Google. For example, the search string
"proprietary use GPL" produces one hit that's clearly relevant to you:

https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/7078/is-it-legal-to-use-gpl-code-in-a-proprietary-closed-source-program-by-putting-i


Moreover, many people in this community strongly discourage disseminating
proprietary code based on R. R, after all, is free software, (fill in some
other objections here). Here are three easy alternatives I can think of:
(list the three)"

This method is more neutrally worded. It doesn't insult the original
poster. It doesn't assume the poster had bad intent.

Instead, you chose to phrase it thus:

"Your internet skills are pathetic. Search Google for "proprietary use gpl"
and the first hit is ...  Note that there are (at least) three obvious
alternatives if there is any question in your case ...   I think your
desperation to steal the hard work of the various R contributors seems
quite odious."

Think about the overall tone of your post. Consider also that someone who
agrees with you substantive argument said that your comments were "often
(almost always?) a bit rough about the
edges."

Message-ID: <CAAGSCf2J4rjmj=DLZAVJLPBtocjN40n31VoO0wv6MQDgQHE57Q@mail.gmail.com>

The *SWIM* (Sensitivity Weights for Importance Weights) package is released
on CRAN: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SWIM.

The *SWIM* package provides weights on simulated scenarios from a
stochastic model, such that stressed model components (random variables)
fulfil given probabilistic constraints (e.g. specified values for risk
measures), under the new scenario weights. Scenario weights are selected by
constrained minimisation of the relative entropy to the baseline model.
Implemented constraints are stresses on the Vaule-at-Risk,
Expected-Shortfall, moments and probability intervals. Visual tools such as
plotting of the stressed empirical distribution function, histograms and
sensitivity measures are provided.

Consult the README for examples on GitHub: https://github.com/spesenti/SWIM

Best regards,
SWIM maintainer

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] Introducing teamr Package
Message-ID: <CAJnynRN1hTgmrAO=EDOixktCQee122JPtqEMRc6FEYXhn5vNZw@mail.gmail.com>

Today I am so pleased to introduce my first CRAN package for sending
formatted messages to Microsoft Teams, teamr
<https://github.com/wwwjk366/teamr>.

Motivation is simple here. For years I have been using Slack and built many
slash commands and apps using incoming webhooks with R, but ever since I
started to use Teams, I found that we will have the same needs for
communicating with R as well. So with some inspiration from the Python
package pymsteams <https://pypi.org/project/pymsteams/>. I created
teamr package
with the hope that this package will provide a simple and clean way to talk
to Teams from R.
Installation

You can install the released version of teamr from CRAN
<https://cran.r-project.org/> with:

install.packages("teamr")

And the development version from GitHub <https://github.com/> with:

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("wwwjk366/teamr")

Example

This is a basic example of send a simple titled message to MS Teams:

library(teamr)
# initiate new connector card object
cc <- connector_card$new(hookurl =
"https://outlook.office.com/webhook/...")# add text
cc$text("This is text of main body.")# add title
cc$title("This is message title")# add hyperlink button
cc$add_link_button("Read more", "https://www.google.com")# change theme color
cc$color("#008000")

We can print out the payload that will be sending to given webhook using
printmethod

# print out the payload for checking
cc$print()

Card:
  hookurl: https://outlook.office.com/webhook/...
  payload:  {"text":"This is text of main body.","title":"This is
message title","potentialAction":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"ViewAction","name":"Read
more","target":["https://www.google.com"]}],"themeColor":"#008000"}

Our JSON payload looks good, time to send it out :)

# send to Teams
cc$send()

[1] TRUE

send menthod will return TRUE if send was successful (status code 200). If
it failed, it will return the reponse object for further investigation. Our
message with a link button will looks like this:

 Relabelling and k-Means Clustering
Message-ID: <20190724110931.Horde.KX2QOipvW-Cw3tvL2E2fiIc@wmail4.units.it>


The new version (0.2.0) of rhe 'pivmet' package is released on CRAN:
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pivmet.

The package offers a collection of pivotal algorithms
for: relabelling the MCMC chains in order to undo the label
switching problem in Bayesian mixture models,
as proposed in Egidi et al. (2018a);
initializing the centers of the classical k-means algorithm
in order to obtain a better clustering solution (Egidi et al., 2018b).

The new version incorporates the Stan language for fitting
efficient mixture models.

Subject: [R] Reading recurring data in a text file
Message-ID: <CAPoqHzpz0E5KLNG0C=JbeeRTB0gJ7g7oGUSvfTpg3rtVxJrtxQ@mail.gmail.com>

The small reproducible example below works, but is way too slow on the real
problem.  The real problem is attempting to extract ~2920 repeated arrays
from a 60 Mb file and takes ~80 minutes.  I'm wondering how I might
re-engineer the script to avoid opening and closing the file 2920 times as
is the case now.  That is, is there a way to keep the file open and peel
out the arrays and stuff them into a list of data.tables, as is done in the
small reproducible example below, but in a significantly faster way?

Hello,

This is far from a complete answer.

A quicky one: no loops.

mc_list2 <- grep(srchStr1, lines)
tmp_list2 <- grep(srchStr2, lines)

identical(mc_list, mc_list2)    # [1] TRUE
identical(tmp_list, tmp_list2)  # [1] TRUE


Another one: don't extend lists or vectors inside loops, reserve memory 
beforehand.

wc <- vector("list", length = length(mc_list))
tmp <- vector("list", length = length(tmp_list))


are much better than your

wc <- list()
tmp <- list()


Maybe I will find ways to save time with the really slow instructions.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Hello,

Instead of read.table use

data.table::fread

It's an order of magnitude faster and all you have to do is to change 
the function, all arguments are the same (in this case).


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Yeah, but Jeff's rough-about-the-edges phrasing is much more colourful, 
and colourful is *GOOD*.  There is far too much bland "Shhhh. We 
*mustn't* offend anybody" content in current discourse.  Tell it like it 
is!  Ripley into people!  If the recipient can't take the heat, he or 
she should get out of the kitchen!

cheers,

Rolf Turner

P.S.  Jeff makes a huge and extremely useful contribution to R-help.  He 
gives generously of time and effort to solve beginners' problems.  They 
should appreciate the time and effort and not whinge about being offended.

Hi Rolf:

As they say,  do read the posting guide:

> Good manners: Remember that customs differ. Some people are very direct. Others surround everything they say with hedges and apologies. Be tolerant. Rudeness is never warranted, but sometimes `read the manual? is the appropriate response. Don?t waste time discussing such matters on the list. Ad hominem comments are absolutely out of place.

I don't think these threads have answered the original question.

According to the GPL FAQ:
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#IfInterpreterIsGPL

"If a programming language interpreter is released under the GPL, does that
mean programs written to be interpreted by it must be under GPL-compatible
licenses? ...The interpreted program, to the interpreter, is just
data... However, when the interpreter is extended to provide ?bindings? to
other facilities (often, but not necessarily, libraries), the interpreted
program is effectively linked to the facilities it uses through these
bindings. So if these facilities are released under the GPL, the
interpreted program that uses them must be released in a GPL-compatible
way..."

My interpretation of that, is that the Anamika's R program would need to be
GPL-compatible.

This issue is not completely straightforward.
(e.g. You can have an interpreted program within an interpreted program).
And CRAN packages released under permissive licenses (e.g. BSD, MIT) are
questionable.

None of this is intended to mean, that you shouldn't use R.
But rather, if you use R, there are certain constraints, and I would hope
that the benefits of using R outweigh any perceived cost of such
constraints.

Sorry, I was on my phone and did not see that you were already using but 
completely missing the vectorized nature of these functions.

Consider the following:

#############
# after executing your sample code
slowmethod <- function( whalines ) {
   lines   <- whalines
   mc_list <- NULL
   for (i in 1:length(lines)){
     # Look for start of water content
     if(grepl(srchStr1, lines[i])){
       mc_list <- c(mc_list, i)
     }
   }

   tmp_list <- NULL
   for (i in 1:length(lines)){
     # Look for start of temperature data
     if(grepl(srchStr2, lines[i])){
       tmp_list <- c(tmp_list, i)
     }
   }

   # Store the water content arrays
   wc <- list()
   # Read all the moisture content profiles
   for(i in 1:length(mc_list)){
     lineNum <- mc_list[i] + 3
     mct <- read.table( text = wha
                      , skip=lineNum
                      , nrows=5
                      , col.names=c('depth','wc')
                      )
     wc[[i]] <- mct
   }

   # Store the water temperature arrays
   tmp <- list()
   # Read all the temperature profiles
   for(i in 1:length(tmp_list)){
     lineNum <- tmp_list[i] + 3
     tmpt <- read.table(text = wha, skip=lineNum, nrows=5,
                       col.names=c('depth','tmp'))
     tmp[[i]] <- tmpt
   }
   list(mc = wc, wt = tmp )
}

library(data.table)

fastmethod <- function( whalines ) {
   # identify tabular formatted lines
   idx_tbl0 <- grepl( "^\\s*[.\\d+-]+\\s+[.\\d+-]+\\s*$"
                    , whalines
                    , perl=TRUE )
   # identify groups of lines according to moisture content
   mc_block <- grep( srchStr1, whalines, fixed = TRUE )
   mc_start <- rep( FALSE, length( whalines ) )
   mc_start[ mc_block+4L ] <- TRUE
   grp_mc <- cumsum( mc_start )
   # identify contiguous block of tabular lines in each block
   mc_tab <- 0 == ave( !idx_tbl0, grp_mc, FUN = cumsum )
   # extract moisture content data
   mc_dta <- fread( text = whalines[ mc_tab ], header=FALSE )

If calling a separate chunk of GPL code forced your code to be GPL,
nobody would be able to write proprietary code on Linux.  For example,
Intel would not be able to sell their C/C++ compiler without offering
source code, which they don't.

When you are coupling two programs in this way, one question is "how
independent are they?"  For example, if I write a program in AWK,
it will run under the One True AWK, under gawk, or under mawk.  Nobody
can claim that it is a mere extension of one of them.  Unless I use a
gawk-specific feature...  Or if I write a shell script, as long as it
works just as well with ksh as with bash, nobody can claim it is a
derived work of bash.

Now R is to S-Plus as bash is to ksh.  If your program could use *either*,
and if you just provide your own program, leaving it to the purchaser to
choose between S-Plus and (unmodified!) R, wouldn't the same apply?

But this discourse has gone on far too long already, so I shall say no more.

I most firmly do not agree with you, Rolf.

Over the years that I've been a member of this community I've noted the actions of a small group who have seemed to feel that it is ok to be an asshole to other people, and a group of hangers-on who have applauded and egged on this shameful behaviour.  Some members of this group have moved on, some remain. For a long while, R-help was quite toxic. 

Jeff's response was uncharacteristically rude and should be called out.  I ordinarily find Jeff to be terse, which is totally fine, and not colourful, which is also fine.  If you want colour, go watch WWE. 

Best wishes,

Andrew

    Yeah, but Jeff's rough-about-the-edges phrasing is much more colourful, 
    and colourful is *GOOD*.  There is far too much bland "Shhhh. We 
    *mustn't* offend anybody" content in current discourse.  Tell it like it

Subject: [R] Package manual built by CRAN
Message-ID: <81935a1d-a8a4-99c5-ec88-f736dd74b8c9@bebac.at>

Deer all,

recently I noticed an unexpected effect. The PDF-manual built from the 
package?s .Rd-files looked different to what I was used to before and to 
the one rendered locally. Specifically: If the reference-section looks 
like this

\references{
 ? foo \href{bar}{baz}
 ? ...
}

previously "foo" will be intended (like a normal paragraph), "bar" 
formatted in red and "baz" the URL.

Example: 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/replicateBE/replicateBE.pdf 
(first occurrence at page 5).

In the references not a direct link but a numbered footnote in a 
monospaced font running beyond the right margin of the page. 
Furthermore, the URLs in the footnotes are not correct. The two links of 
page 5:
In ABE.Rd
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/scientific-guideline/guideline-investigation-bioequivalence-rev1_en.pdf
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/scientific-guideline/guideline-pharmacokinetic-clinical-evaluation-modified-release-dosage-forms_en.pdf
Correct links in ABE.html
In the two footnotes of the PDF truncated
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/scientific-guideline/guideline-investigation-bioequivalence-rev1_
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/scientific-guideline/guideline-pharmacokinetic-clinical-evaluation-modified-release-dosage-forms_
Of course, both are punished with a HTTP 404.

Cheers,
Helmut

PS: I know that
\references{
 ? \enumerate{
 ? ? \item foo \href{bar}{baz}
 ? }
}
produces _exactly_ this effect. Didn't use it.

Message-ID: <CA+8n2XTafH33+QgKMK3r4e43446sqiuXQx73mWPeGWrrgaGzqA@mail.gmail.com>

When installing from a private repo, fails if the package depends on
another package from the private repo--even if its already installed.
Example makes this clear

```R
install_github('MyAcct/Preinstalled.Package', auth_token = 'x')
# works
install_github('MyAcct/My.Package', auth_token = 'x', upgrade = FALSE)
# Fails if My.Package depends on Preinstalled.Package -- see below
```
I get the following errors.
```
Downloading GitHub repo MyAcct/My.Package at master
Error: HTTP error 404.
  Not Found

  Did you spell the repo owner (`MyAcct`) and repo name
(`Preinstalled.Package`) correctly?
  - If spelling is correct, check that you have the required permissions to
access the repo.
```

Why is it even checking the repo, since the package is already installed?

This used to work under the old devtools::install_github implementation,
but that is now an alias for remotes::install_gitub

Subject: [R] Survey Data - comparing multiple groups

Hi Everyone,


I am trying to assess whether the mean of carbohydrate intake (dependent variable = continuous) is significantly different between five groups (groups = people categorized into five different groups) (independent variable= categorical). This is survey data with replicates and therefore I have changed the structure of the data to svyrepdesign.


I have ran Kruskal Wallis as follows but get the following error:

svyranktest(CARB ~ group, df, test=c("KruskalWallis"))


> Error in if (this.n == 1 && !this.certain) { :

  missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed


I also ran svyglm but am unable to conduct this test to look at comparisons between groups:

summary(svyglm(CARB ~ group, design=df, family=gaussian))


I would like to be able to get p-values between the groups and be able to adjust for multiple comparisons and would appreciate if someone can guide me.


I appreciate your help.


Thanks,

Mav

And df is a data frame, I also assume.
(Complete self-contained examples are good).

I checked the documentation.
The second argument is not a data frame.

Thanks, Abby.


Apologies, I did convert my df into a svrepdesign object as follows:

df<-svrepdesign (data=df1, scale=1, repweights = df1[, 496:995], type="BRR", combined.weights=TRUE, weight=~WTS_P, na.rm=TRUE)


 therefore, I have called "df" as a svrepdesign however, from the survey package, the svyranktest is shown  with svydesign only and not with svrepdesign. I could consider using other tests such as svyglm but am also having issues with it.


Thank you,

Mav

And df is a data frame, I also assume.

Subject: [R] "rgb()" problem
Message-ID: <1829fadc2fef5a0e10d58e085e1f02227e9fe4be.camel@med.uni-goettingen.de>

Hi,

I experienced a problem with the "rgb()" function.
These two calls should (and do) return identical results:

  rgb(255, 128, 128, maxColorValue=255)
  rgb(1.0, 0.5, 0.5, maxColorValue=1)

However, when I specify a non-default "alpha" channel (a "transparent"
colour), I get differing results:

  rgb(255, 128, 128, alpha=0.5, maxColorValue=255)
  rgb(1.0, 0.5, 0.5, alpha=0.5, maxColorValue=1)

where only the latter version seems to yield the actually intended
result.

Is this a bug?


You can check the actual colours' appearance this way:

  barplot(3:5, col=rgb(255, 128, 128, maxColorValue=255))
  barplot(3:5, col=rgb(1.0, 0.5, 0.5, maxColorValue=1))

  barplot(3:5, col=rgb(255, 128, 128, alpha=0.5, maxColorValue=255))
  barplot(3:5, col=rgb(1.0, 0.5, 0.5, alpha=0.5, maxColorValue=1))

The apparently buggy version in this case seems to return white instead
of red.


Thanks,

Christian

I think it's red, but fully transparent. Alpha follows the same rules
as red, green and blue components; it is expected to be in range [0;
maxColorValue]. rgb(255, 128, 128, alpha=128, maxColorValue=255) should
give you the expected result.

Sorry, I meanwhile realized -- specifying

  rgb(255, 128, 128, alpha=0.5*255, maxColorValue=255)

and

  rgb(1.0, 0.5, 0.5, alpha=0.5, maxColorValue=1)

gives you (virtually) identical results, i.e., you need to also specify
the "alpha" parameter in the range given by the "maxColorValue"
argument.

Sorry for the confusion,

Christian

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] New package MBNMAdose: dose-response meta-analysis
Message-ID: <CAKcJ18NYWQOmCZD+ks0bh7j9FHeTto0qgFfh5J=GSsFCfQ-6FA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I would like to introduce you to a new package available on CRAN for
performing meta-analysis of dose-response relationships, 'MBNMAdose'.

For anyone who has performed a meta-analysis or network meta-analysis
before, you might be aware of the difficulties of including different doses
of a drug. Typically one either assumes that different doses have a broadly
similar effect, or that they are totally independent.

MBNMAdose allows you to explicitly model the dose-response relationship in
a statistically robust framework. By modelling dose-response relationships
this can connect networks of evidence that might otherwise be disconnected,
and can improve precision on treatment estimates.

There's a detailed vignette included with the package that explains
everything in a lot more detail for those that are interested.

Any feedback or suggestions for improvements would be hugely welcome.

Many thanks,

Hugo

Here is another possibility

library(stringr)

readterm <- function(term, text) {
    lapply(str_split(text, fixed(term))[[1]][-1],
           fread, skip = 4, nrows = 5
           )
}

easymethod <- function(whalines) {
    whalines <- str_c(whalines, collapse = "\n")
    lapply(c(srchStr1, srchStr2),
           readterm, text = whalines
    )
}


## perhaps a tad slower, but I find it easier to follow.

library(microbenchmark)
bigwhalines <- strsplit( paste( rep( wha, 100 )
                               , collapse = "\n" )
                        , "\n" )[[ 1 ]]
microbenchmark(slowresult <- slowmethod( bigwhalines ),
               fastresult <- fastmethod( bigwhalines ),
               easyresult <- easymethod( bigwhalines )
               )

Subject: [R] Creating a conditional lag variable in R
Message-ID: <9452974A-8298-4D11-B294-568AF9C430E9@gmail.com>

Dear R-users, 

I?ve a rather complicated task to do and need all the help I can get. 

I have data indicating whether a country has signed an agreement or not (1=yes and 0=otherwise). I want to simply create variable that would capture the years before the agreement is signed. The aim is to see whether pre or post agreement period has any impact on my dependent variables. 

More preciesly, I want to create the following variables: 
(i) a variable that is =1 in the 4 years pre/before the agreement, 0 otherwise; 
(ii) a variable that is =1 5 years pre the agreement and 
(iii) a variable that would count the 4 and 5 years pre the agreement (1,2,3,4..). 

Please see the sample data below. I have manually added the variables I would like to generate in R, labelled as ?X1_pre4? ( 4 years before the agreement X1), ?X2_pre4?, ?X1_pret5? ( 5 years before the agreement X5), and ?X1pre5_count? (which basically count the years, 1,2,3, etc). The X1 and X2 is the agreement that countries have either signed (1) or not (0). Note though that I want the variable to capture all the years up to 4 and 5. If it?s only 2 years, it should still be ==1 (please see the example below). 

To illustrate the logic: the country A has signed the agreement X1 in 1972 in the sample data,  then, the (i) and (ii) variables as above should be =1 for the years 1970, 1971, and =0 from 1972 until the end of the study period. 

The country A has signed the agreement X2 in 1975,  then, the (i) variable should be =1 from 1971 to 1974 (post 4 years) and (ii) should be =1 for the  1970-1974  period (post 5 years before the agreement is signed). 

Later, I would also like to create post_4 and post_5 variables, but I think I?ll be able to figure it out once I know how to generate the pre/before variables. 

All suggestions are much appreciated!

Hi Faradj,
There is a problem with your structure statement in that the hyphen
(-) following the left angle bracket (<) has been transformed into a
fancy hyphen somewhere in the process. I replaced it with an ordinary
hyphen and it worked okay. Also, your coding for "B" seems to include
the first year (1970) of "C". I have taken the liberty of correcting
this.
What you are trying to do looks a bit over-complicated to me. The
variables X1 and X2 are very redundant. Perhaps you only need to know
when the agreement was signed (1972 for country A) and when the
agreement was proposed (1970?). Thus for each country, you could
generate a delay for signing agreement X1 (A=2, B=8, C=14) and X2
(A=5, B=1, C=13). If you want to categorize the delay, I would suggest
ensuring that the category breaks are meaningful [1].
However, to answer your question, I would create X1_pre4 and
X1_pre4_count as simply the inverse of X1, then use "cumsum" to create
the year counting variable. Then change every instance of
X1_pre4_count greater than 4 to zero and also the corresponding values
of X1_pre4.

data$X1_pre4<-ifelse(data$X1,0,1)
data$X1_pre4_count[data$country=="A"]<-
 cumsum(data$X1_pre4_count[data$country=="A"])
data$X1_pre4_count[data$country=="B"]<-
 cumsum(data$X1_pre4_count[data$country=="B"])
data$X1_pre4_count[data$country=="c"]<-
 cumsum(data$X1_pre4_count[data$country=="C"])
knockout<-which(data$X1_pre4_count == 0 | data$X1_pre4_count > 4)
data$X1_pre4_count[knockout]<-0
data$X1_pre4[knockout]<-0

Same for "X2" and "pre5".

Re-post, now in *plain text*. 



Dear R-users, 

I?ve a rather complicated task to do and need all the help I can get. 

I have data indicating whether a country has signed an agreement or not (1=yes and 0=otherwise). I want to simply create variable that would capture the years before the agreement is signed. The aim is to see whether pre or post agreement period has any impact on my dependent variables. 

More preciesly, I want to create the following variables: 
(i) a variable that is =1 in the 4 years pre/before the agreement, 0 otherwise; 
(ii) a variable that is =1 5 years pre the agreement and 
(iii) a variable that would count the 4 and 5 years pre the agreement (1,2,3,4..). 

Please see the sample data below. I have manually added the variables I would like to generate in R, labelled as ?X1_pre4? ( 4 years before the agreement X1), ?X2_pre4?, ?X1_pret5? ( 5 years before the agreement X5), and ?X1pre5_count? (which basically count the years, 1,2,3, etc). The X1 and X2 is the agreement that countries have either signed (1) or not (0). Note though that I want the variable to capture all the years up to 4 and 5. If it?s only 2 years, it should still be ==1 (please see the example below). 

To illustrate the logic: the country A has signed the agreement X1 in 1972 in the sample data,  then, the (i) and (ii) variables as above should be =1 for the years 1970, 1971, and =0 from 1972 until the end of the study period. 

The country A has signed the agreement X2 in 1975,  then, the (i) variable should be =1 from 1971 to 1974 (post 4 years) and (ii) should be =1 for the  1970-1974  period (post 5 years before the agreement is signed). 

Later, I would also like to create post_4 and post_5 variables, but I think I?ll be able to figure it out once I know how to generate the pre/before variables. 

All suggestions are much appreciated!

Hey Anamika,

I only caught the tail end of what became an off-topic thread, but backed up a bit to your original q. If I'm duplicating anything previous, apologies.

If you are going to ship your "product" to end users directly (vs provide via an API or web application) I'm not sure how you get around the "you have to ship your source code" problem (regardless of license issues). Even the best obfuscation is fairly easily overcome these days.

On a different note, apart from {RTextTools} and {tabulizer} (both of which aren't on CRAN so I couldn't just run a script against my mirror) you have the follow package licensing dependencies as well:

   License                                 n
 1 GPL-3                                   7
 2 MIT + file LICENSE                      7
 3 GPL (>= 2)                              5
 4 GPL-2                                   4
 5 GPL-2 | GPL-3                           4
 6 BSD 2-clause License + file LICENSE     1
 7 BSD_3_clause + file LICENSE             1
 8 file LICENSE                            1
 9 GPL-2 | file LICENSE                    1
10 MPL-2.0 | file LICENSE                  1

So, if you do end up distributing something you're going to need to plan for adhering to the requirements of each of those when it comes to how you have to message the use of them (and license for them) to end-users.

If this is a pay-for piece of software you're hoping to distribute directly to end users then I'd highly suggest seeking legal assistance from a firm that specializes in reviewing licensing situations. They abound these days and it'll ultimately be worth the expense (it shouldn't be too bad).

Some pointers (not tested, may contain blunders...)

(a) you likely need some sort of split-operate-unsplit construct, by country. E.g.,

myfun <- function(d) {....operate on data frame with only one country....} 
ll <- split(data, data$country)
ll.new <- lapply(ll, myfun)
data.new <- unsplit(ll.new, data$country)

(There might be a tidyverse idiom for this too)

(b) your X1_pre5count looks like it is the same as cumsum(1-X1)*X1 (within country)

(c) if you count in the opposite direction, tt <- rev(cumsum(rev(1-X1))) you get number of years until agreement. Then X1_pre4 should be as.integer(tt <=4  & tt > 0)

Peter Dalgaard, 

Thanks for this. 

I?ll try to think of ways to apply this logic. At the moment, I?m trying to do this with ?mutate? using dplyr package. But it?s not easy..

Thank you all. I now have the right solution for this (perhaps of interest to some): 

check_pre <- function(idx, k) { pre_vec <- sapply(1:length(idx), function(x) +any(idx[x:(pmin(x + k, length(idx)))] %in% 1)); pre_vec[idx == 1] <- 0; return(pre_vec) }

df %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(
    idx = +( (lag(X1) == 0 & X1 == 1) | row_number() == 1 & X1 == 1),
    X1_pre4 = check_pre(idx, 4),
    X1_pre5 = check_pre(idx, 5),
    idx = NULL
  )

Subject: [R] Modelos neural netwok
Message-ID: <001501d544a2$93fba170$bbf2e450$@rcumariacristina.com>

Estimados miembros de la Lista:



Me dirijo a vosotros para que, si pod?is, ilumin?is mi confusi?n.



Estoy trabajando con los modelos neural netwok del  libro Forecasting,
Principles and Practice, de Hyndman y Athanasopoulos, segunda edici?n.



Mi confusi?n se debe al hecho de que para trabajar con estos modelos, se
recomienda particionar la serie temporal en estudio en, al menos, dos
submuestras:  una para estimar el modelo, y la otra para validar el modelo.
Pues bien, en los ejemplos del mencionado libro y en el paquete fpp2, que
acompa?a al libro, los modelos se obtienen utilizando la muestra completa y
haciendo predicci?n hacia el futuro. No veo ninguna alusi?n  a la  muestra
de validaci?n, antes aludida.



Pienso que algo se me est? escapando, y agradecer? cuanto pod?is hacer para
ayudarme.



Muchas gracias por vuestra atenci?n.



Agust?n Alonso

Hello,

This is an English language list, please ask questions in English.

As for the question, package fpp2 is a package described as

  	Data for "Forecasting: principles and practice" (2nd ed, 2017)

And in fact there are no examples in the package.

If you are talking about examples in the book, there is nothing we can 
do. This is a mail list for R code doubts, not for consultation or 
tutoring in statistics. Give a code example if you can with a question 
on that example, but don't expect a book specific answer.

It seems you should your teacher this question.


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Splitting a data set into a part to be used for fitting a model
(the training set) and a part to be used for evaluating the
quality of the model on new cases (the test set) has been good
practice for a long time.  If the architecture of the model is
to be learned as well as parameters, a three-way split is used.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets
will get you started.

I have not seen the book or the package.  With any example in
any book, you have to ask "what is this example supposed to
demonstrate?"  A bit over 40 years ago a friend of mine had
great trouble trying to learn statistics.  He read the books
diligently, but said to me "I look at the examples, and can
never understand why the method shown in the example is the
best method for that problem".  That's because it wasn't.
The example is meant to demonstrate a particular method, and
a problem is chosen that the method can be applied to, and
the author never bothers with the question "is this a good
method for this problem".  It may be that you are looking at
an example expecting to be told "what should I do with a
data set like this" whereas the author was telling you "this
is how to fit a model like this and use it to predict the
future".

This applies to examples in R documentation too.

This is outside my area.
However, as no one else as responded, I'll offer some more comments.

Firstly, I'm doubtful the Kruskal Wallis test will give you pairwise
p-values.
There are other tests for this.
It's also possible to create a matrix of p-values, using an arbitrary test,
and then use a correction method.
However, I recommend caution with this.

Secondly, I don't know if the svyranktest() function will work with the
svrepdesign object or not.
However, if not, I would assume that other functions in the package would
work.

Either way, I'm wondering if you've created the svrepdesign object
correctly.
In particular, "weight=~WTS_P" would assign a formula to weights, probably,
which doesn't sound right.
And "repweights = df1[, 496:995]" looks questionable, because one, is has
hundreds of columns, and two, you've already given that data in the first
argument.

If you have Event_type as a strata variable, it seems problematic that 
it be also interacting as a fixed effect.

How exactly do you expect the Surv-function to handle such a vector?

The help page for Surv() says:? "For multiple endpoint data the event 
variable will be a factor, whose first level is treated as censoring."

So it, too, would not be "expecting" a two-item vector. Seems that the 
multi-state formulation would make more sense.

I'm reasonably sure 0 would be interpreted as a censored observation.

I doubt it. I'm pretty sure there would be a conflation of effects and 
stratification.

I cannot lay my hands on my copy of that text, but I'm fairly sure it 
never mixed strata(.) and fixed effects for a variable in the same model.


I suppose this is where I should admit? that I'm trained as an 
epidemiologist and not as a statistician, but I've done a fair amount of 
work with these models. Seems to me that your code are sufficiently out 
of the mainstream practice that you would at least want to create a 
simulated data-set and see if this results in agreement with assumptions.

Hi Richard,
Nice comment on how authors use examples to show *how* to use a particular
method, not necessarily *when* to use a particular method (or which method
to use).
Good to keep in mind.
Thanks for sharing.

Hi Anuj,
I am providing comments regarding your first attempt to call mapply.
Since you are working with named arguments, you shouldn't need to include
the NULLs in the call.
Also you have provided the argument MoreArgs twice, which is what is
causing the Error message.
You can replace that call with the following:
mapply (chart_Series, mget(symVec), name=infoVec, MoreArgs=c(cp,ct) )

Best,
Eric

It compiles without errors, but the chart_pars() and chart_theme() are
not being applied. eg. the Right Y-axis label still exists in p.pdf.
Is it possible that cp and ct don't easily vectorize?

# setup chart theme

ct$lylab <- TRUE        # AG: enable left y-axis labels
ct$rylab <- FALSE       # AG: remove right y-axis labels

# read values into vectors
csv <- read.csv("p.txt", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
symVec <- getSymbols(as.vector(csv$s))
infoVec <- mapply(paste, csv$s, csv$n, sep=": ") # eg. SYM: Name
cpVec = rep(cp, times=nrow(csv))

# create PDF
pdf(file = "p.pdf")
par(mfrow = c( 5, 4 ) )
mapply (chart_Series, mget(symVec), name=infoVec, MoreArgs=c(cp,ct))
dev.off()

>>> I tried the options below, but none of them work properly

mapply (chart_Series, mget(symVec), name=infoVec,

mapply (chart_Series, mget(symVec), name=infoVec, MoreArgs=list("pars=cp"))

Hi Anul,
Try this (it worked for me)

mapply (chart_Series, mget(symVec), name=infoVec, MoreArgs=list(pars=cp,
theme=ct ))

Best,
Eric

Message-ID: <CAHuEqfknYHJ-dJwfepB=74C2HmD4qT8ZcC7MV001ym=imbnLLw@mail.gmail.com>

Why does pdf() work outside a function, but not inside it?

R version 3.6.0 (2019-04-26) on Mac 10.14.5

# R --silent --vanilla < s2.r
library(quantmod)
options("getSymbols.warning4.0"=FALSE)
options("getSymbols.yahoo.warning"=FALSE)

gs <- function(f) {
  csvText <- "s,n\nAFL,AFLAC\nAIG,AIG"
  csv <- read.csv(text=csvText, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  symVec <- getSymbols(as.vector(csv$s))

  # create PDF
  fname = paste0(f,".pdf")
  pdf(file = fname)
  par(mfrow = c( 4,2 ) )
  mapply (chart_Series, mget(symVec))
  dev.off()
}
gs("t")

csvText <- "s,n\nAFL,AFLAC\nAIG,AIG"
csv <- read.csv(text=csvText, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
symVec <- getSymbols(as.vector(csv$s))

# create PDF
pdf(file = "t2.pdf")
par(mfrow = c( 4,2 ) )
mapply (chart_Series, mget(symVec))
dev.off()

Try a simpler example, and you'll see that it does, e.g.

  f <- function() { pdf("temp.pdf"); plot(1, main="inside f"); dev.off() }

   You're doing very complicated things in your function; quantmod does 
very complicated things in getSymbols().  One of those complicated 
things is breaking, it's not pdf() that's breaking.

Thanks!  I think the quantmod maintainer is trying to make it a bit
more functional so there are fewer side effects.
I'll try to find a workaround.

Because you use a graphics system that need printing to produce the
plot.  On the command line auto-printing is your friend, but in
functions you have to do it explicitly yourself.

Change this to

    mapply( function(x) print(chart_Series(x)), mget(symVec))

and it should work.  At least it does on my machine:

Actually, no, we cannot. R-Help is for R code issues, not to teach 
statistics. I must have a *specific* R code problem to ask.

I suggest you first learn Monte Carlo simulation and go through the many 
examples that can be found on-line. Then come back with *code* that 
doesn't work, or that doesn't do what you expect it to do, or a similar 
problem.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Hi Tolulope,
Get the Monte Carlo package:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MonteCarlo/vignettes/MonteCarlo-Vignette.html

and look at an online tutorial:

Denise, 

Interacting a fixed effect with a strata variable is not uncommon.  No main effect of the strata variable is possible but the interaction term allows the fixed effect variable to have different values in different strata.  I've more often seen it coded as a direct interaction:

coxph( Surv(Time, Status) ~ treatment*strata(Event_type) + frailty(ID), data=example)

(e.g., page 47 of Therneau and Grambsch)

I don't see anything inherently wrong with your interpretation of the model.  While it seems that the assumption of no effect of one event on the other is very strong, I don't know the context of your analysis. I visualized it as a 4-state model.  Everyone starts in 0 ("neither event").  There are hazards of moving from state 0 to state 1 (lambda01(t)) and from state 0 to state 2 (lambda02(t)).  The last state is "both events".  There are hazards of moving from state 1 to state 3 (lambda13(t), which you are assuming is identical to lambda02(t)) and from state 2 to state 3 (lambda23(t), which you are assuming is identical to lambda01(t)).

I did not observe much gain from the frailty term (unmeasured covariate) with only 2 events in the short simulation I tried (except when the effect was very strong and I got convergence warnings).

Chris

for (k in seq(kk)) {
	short[[paste0("time", k)]] <- rweibullPH(nn, shape=2, scale=exp(beta[k]*tx)*gamma)
}
# might want to allow censoring

long <- reshape(short, direction="long", varying = paste0("time", seq(kk)), v.names="times", timevar="event", idvar="id", times=seq(kk))
long <- long[order(long$id, long$event),]

mod <- coxph(Surv(times) ~ tx * strata(event) + frailty(id), data=long)
#summary(mod)

mod0 <- coxph(Surv(times) ~ tx * strata(event), data=long)
#summary(mod0)

mod1 <- coxph(Surv(times) ~ tx, data=long, subset=event==1)

mod2 <- coxph(Surv(times) ~ tx, data=long, subset=event==2)

coef(mod)
coef(mod0)
coef(mod1)
coef(mod2) - coef(mod1)

If you have Event_type as a strata variable, it seems problematic that 
it be also interacting as a fixed effect.

How exactly do you expect the Surv-function to handle such a vector?

The help page for Surv() says:? "For multiple endpoint data the event 
variable will be a factor, whose first level is treated as censoring."

So it, too, would not be "expecting" a two-item vector. Seems that the 
multi-state formulation would make more sense.

I'm reasonably sure 0 would be interpreted as a censored observation.

I doubt it. I'm pretty sure there would be a conflation of effects and 
stratification.

I cannot lay my hands on my copy of that text, but I'm fairly sure it 
never mixed strata(.) and fixed effects for a variable in the same model.


I suppose this is where I should admit? that I'm trained as an 
epidemiologist and not as a statistician, but I've done a fair amount of 
work with these models. Seems to me that your code are sufficiently out 
of the mainstream practice that you would at least want to create a 
simulated data-set and see if this results in agreement with assumptions.

Subject: [R] How to create a new column based on the values from multiple
 columns which are matching a particular string?
Message-ID: <CAF9-5jP1s50mtk1gKVD2dxvA4OVP9TuUYjqsHCd=XpDPDp0PNg@mail.gmail.com>

I have data frame which looks like this:

df=data.frame(
  eye_problemsdisorders_f6148_0_1=c(A,C,D,NA,D,A,C,NA,B,A),
  eye_problemsdisorders_f6148_0_2=c(B,C,NA,A,C,B,NA,NA,A,D),
  eye_problemsdisorders_f6148_0_3=c(C,A,D,D,B,A,NA,NA,A,B),
  eye_problemsdisorders_f6148_0_4=c(D,D,NA,B,A,C,NA,C,A,B),
  eye_problemsdisorders_f6148_0_5=c(C,C,NA,D,B,C,NA,D,D,B))

In reality I have much more columns and they don't always match
"eye_problemsdisorders_f6148" this string, and there is much more rows.

What I would like to do is create a new column, say named "case" where I
would have value "1" for every row where string "A" appears at least once
in any column, if not the value would be "0". So in the above example
column "case" would have these values: 1,1,1,1,0
Thanks

You may have a typo/misstatement in your question.
You define a data frame with 5 columns, each of which has 10 elements, so
your data frame has dimensions 10 x 5.
Then you request a new COLUMN which will have only 5 elements, which is not
allowed. All columns of a data frame
must have the same length.

sorry my bad, here is the edited version:

so the data frame is this:

df=data.frame(
  eye_problemsdisorders_f6148_0_1=c("A","C","D",NA,"D","A","C",NA,"B","A"),
  eye_problemsdisorders_f6148_0_2=c("B","C",NA,"A","C","B",NA,NA,"A","D"),
  eye_problemsdisorders_f6148_0_3=c("C","A","D","D","B","A",NA,NA,"A","B"),
  eye_problemsdisorders_f6148_0_4=c("D","D",NA,"B","A","C",NA,"C","A","B"),
  eye_problemsdisorders_f6148_0_5=c("C","C",NA,"D","B","C",NA,"D","D","B")

and I would need to put inside the column which would be named "case" and
values inside would be: 1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1

so "case" column is where value "A" can be found in any column.

Thank you so much! Just to confirm here MARGIN=1 indicates that "A" should
appear at least once per row?

While Eric's solution is correct( mod "corner" cases like all NA's in
a row), it can be made considerably more efficient.

One minor improvement can be made by using the idiom
any(x == "A")
instead of matching via %in% for the simple case of matching just a
single value.

However, a considerable improvement can be made by getting fancy,
taking advantage of do.call() and the pmax() function to mostly
vectorize the calculation. Here are the details and timing on a large
data frame.

(Note: I removed the names in the %in% approach for simplicity. It has
almost no effect on timings.
I also moved the as.integer() call out of the function so that it is
called only once at the end, which improves efficiency a bit)

1. Eric's original:
fun1 <-function(df,what)
{
  as.integer(unname(apply(df,MARGIN = 1,function(v) { what %in% v })))
}

2. Using any( x == "A") instead:
fun2 <- function(df,what)
{
   as.integer(unname(apply(df,MARGIN =1, function(x)any(x == what,
na.rm=TRUE))))
}

3. Getting fancy to use pmax()
fun3 <- function(df,what)
{
   z <- lapply(df,function(x)as.integer((x==what)))
   do.call(pmax,c(z,na.rm=TRUE))
}

Here are the timings:

> bigdf <- df[rep(1:10,1e4), rep(1:5, 50)]
> dim(bigdf)
[1] 100000    250

> system.time(res1 <- fun1(bigdf, "A"))
   user  system elapsed
  2.204   0.432   2.637
>
> system.time(res2 <- fun2(bigdf, "A"))
   user  system elapsed
  1.898   0.403   2.302
>
> system.time(res3 <- fun3(bigdf, "A"))
   user  system elapsed
  0.187   0.048   0.235

## 10 times faster!

>
> all.equal(res1,res2)
[1] TRUE
> all.equal(res1,res3)
[1] TRUE


NB: I freely admit that Eric's original solution may well be perfectly
adequate, and the speed improvement is pointless. In that case, maybe
this is at least somewhat instructive for someone.

Nevertheless, I would welcome further suggestions for improvement, as
I suspect my "fancy" approach is still a ways from what one can do (in
R code, without resorting to C++).

Cheers,
Bert

fun4 <- function(df, what)
{
   as.integer(rowSums(df == what, na.rm = TRUE) > 0)
}

The function above works for data.frame and matrix inputs as well. It is 
slower than fun3() if 'df' is a data.frame, but is faster if 'df' is a 
matrix (which is a more efficient representation of the data if it 
contains only character columns).

A note to Ana: 'df' is the name of a function in R (see ?stats::df); not 
a perfect choice for a variable name.

Denes

Subject: [R] Problem with rio/haven
Message-ID: <d1c40d9a-babe-3bb8-3ad0-7477c1598dcb@wiwi.hu-berlin.de>

Hi,

I got the following error when reading a Stata file:

 > library("rio")
 > x <- import('XXX.dta')
Fehler in df_parse_dta_file(spec, encoding) :
   Evaluation error: Column name `Merge` must not be duplicated.
Use .name_repair to specify repair.

I understand that the column name "Merge" appears at least twice in the 
Stata file.

My problem is that I have created the data as data.frame in R and saved 
with the export command of rio. How could it be that I can save a data 
set but I'am not able to read in again?

Sigbert

Don't use pipes but functional programming style, then you can eaasily 
traceback() and use debugging tools.

Thanks Uwe, maybe i can be clearer; the error is: Warning: Error in :
Column `Previous_stage` is unknown.
Ans please what do you mean by functional programming style?

Use the functional style such as mean(x) instead of the piping style 
such as x %>% mean.

Hi,

I would guess that your data object (matrix, data.frame?) does not have 
a column called "Previous_stage".
Maybe you just misspelled it; remember that R is case-sensitive.

Please forgive me if I'm completely off!

HTH,
Ivan

It has, i have checked and double checked.
Could it be a problem with Tibble?

    Hi,

    I would guess that your data object (matrix, data.frame?) does not have
    a column called "Previous_stage".
    Maybe you just misspelled it; remember that R is case-sensitive.

    Please forgive me if I'm completely off!

Hello to all,

how can I can set both  y as character to get the bars beside like 
example 1 and  use scale_y_continuous

And an additional question: why are the bar colors of  x-axes = 8 turned

datax= data.frame("fac"=c(c(rep(1,10),c(rep(2,10)))),"x"=c(c(1:10,c(1:10))),

              51,16,36, 4, 3,3,77, 5,30,61))


ggplot(data=datax, aes(x=x, y=as.character(y), fill=fac)) +
   geom_bar(stat="identity", color="black", position=position_dodge())+

Hello,

You must use a categorical variable in 'fill'.

Example: (I also set the fill colours to something else.)


ggplot(data = datax, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = factor(fac))) +
   geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "black",
            position = position_dodge()) +
   theme_minimal() +
   scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "red")) +
   scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12) +
   scale_y_discrete(limits = c(0, 100))


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

My guess: See the check.names argument in ?data.frame. I suspect that
the code is using this -- or something like it -- with its value =
FALSE.

Hi,
I just noticed the difference in a teaching data generation script between
version 3.6.1 and earlier.

#! R version 3.4.3
set.seed(2019); sample(1:10, 1)
[1] 8

#! R version 3.5.1patched
set.seed(2019); sample(1:10, 1)
[1] 8

#! R version 3.5.3patched
set.seed(2019); sample(1:10, 1)
[1] 8

#! R version 3.6.0patched
set.seed(2019); sample(1:10, 1)
[1] 8

#! R version 3.6.1patched
set.seed(2019); sample(1:10, 1)
[1] 9  # <--------------------------------- Here!

Is it a bug?
if not (is a new feature) how can I maintain compatibility between version
3.6.1 and all others?

My understanding is that sample() in 3.6.0 did, in fact, change in
ways that detach it from set.seed().

You can use RNGkind() or RNGversion() to recapture the old behavior.

See https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/NEWS.R-3.6.1.html in the
section CHANGES IN R 3.6.0 .

Poorly phrased--makes it act differently with respect to set.seed() .

Thanks Patrick.

I took a look at the documentation of the RNGkind and RNGversion
functions but didn't understand how they work. Can you exemplify how I
can, through them, to recapture the old behavior?

Best,

There seem to be a couple of ways to do this.

Rngkind( sample.kind="Rounding" )

or

RNGversion("3.5.2")

per

?Random

Subject: [R] Question about NRC lexicon usage
Message-ID: <CAGN=ytPD3ohiKDvSui1AAE99sM14=K0Xt2c8yQkKtxBocKGxfA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I hope you are doing well!
I used NRC lexicon and did sentiment analysis on my data. the result is:

         sentiment         count
anger               574
anticipation 1400
disgust          236
fear                 978
joy                   729
sadness            578
surprise         405
trust              2125
negative         1531
positive          3853

Total count of emotions: 7025
Total count of positive and negative sentiments: 5384
I am faced with a question: Why total count of emotions is not equal with
total count of sentiment?

I attached my R Code.
Thank you!
With best regards,

It is not obvious that this is an R question, but 2 suggestions

(a) some emotions are not clearly positive or negative (e.g. anticipation)
(b) emotions possibly not mutually exclusive

Subject: [R] 3.6 on debian stretch
Message-ID: <CACwCsY7PggYpoPNLvFtbw0ciFErGZuuq664_XAGTGr1rE-GV_w@mail.gmail.com>

I need to run 3.6 on debian stretch - I followed the instructions here:

https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian/

and I was able to install it. But 2 packages I need,  r-cran-caret and
r-cran-ggplot2 will not install:

# apt-get install r-cran-ggplot2

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 r-cran-ggplot2 : Depends: r-api-3
                  Depends: r-cran-digest but it is not going to be installed
                  Depends: r-cran-gtable (>= 0.1.1) but it is not
going to be installed
                  Depends: r-cran-plyr (>= 1.7.1) but it is not going
to be installed
                  Depends: r-cran-reshape2 but it is not going to be installed
                  Depends: r-cran-scales (>= 0.4.1) but it is not
going to be installed
                  Depends: r-cran-tibble but it is not going to be installed
                  Depends: r-cran-lazyeval but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

Is there a way to get these 2 packages for my environment?

Thanks!

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] new version (2.0.0) of spectrino package
Message-ID: <63dd5294-e9ae-294d-5f09-0a835c40637d@sicyon.com>

The new version (2.0.0) of 'spectrino' package is released on CRAN: 
_https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spectrino_.

Remainder: ?spectrino? is a spectra preparation software utility for R. 
It is OS specific tool (Microsoft Windows), with specialized 
visualization, organization and pre-processing features for spectra 
(mostly mass-spec). The software accepts spectral data from analytical 
instruments and then prepares a data structure to be introduced into R. 
?spectrino? has a rich set of features to create data structures and 
visually manipulate/compare spectra.

Version 2.0 of Spectrino adds new features to the spectral part of the 
application (multi-tab spec-trees) and a completely new part - blocks of 
properties. The latter provides user interface to a list of properties 
(accessible from your script) as well as log, chart and snippet (small 
pieces of code) support. As properties are modifiable from both sides: 
user interface and your code, this feature offers a versatile and 
convenient way for parametrized control to your algorithm.

For more details (including manual) visit http://spectrino.com

You may read an article about Spectrino (v1.6) in "Journal of 
Statistical Software" https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v018i10

All the best
