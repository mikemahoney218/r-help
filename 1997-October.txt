Hello,

I am trying to print graphs using R on MS windows

Hello. I'm curious whether anyone has successfully installed R on a Power

linux on my Mac if I was aware that someone has been able to install R.

Thanks! Bill

Should I be concerned about the m4 error?  I am prepared to believe

I will make a tar file of the library available as

Yes, Doug,
the 'm4' error message  must come from a 
syntax error in an R documentation (aka 'man') file.

Usually it is a missing ")"...

Finding the exact location:  First you should try to guess which file
causes the problem. This is not so hard (usually).
Then,  using emacs ;-) with font-locking  and paren-matching
usually has helped to locate the problem quickly.

Note that in version 0.60  these problems fortunately will be gone,...
(new .Rd format  and  perl used for doing the translations.
 ``perl'', ie., you will love it, Doug!)

  Is it just me?  I'm using Win 3.1 on a 486Dx50 with 16megs of RAM.  
Do I need to give options? I did try -v2, which didn't help.

Hi

Sorry to bother list members with this query but I can't find any relavent
documentation.

I just installed R-base-0.50.a4-1.i386.rpm for redhat linux but am missing
a library file. rpm complained and so does R. When I try to run R I get

/usr/lib/R/bin/R.binary: can't load library 'libf2c.so.0'

What else do I need to install - i have g77 0.5.20 which works fine but
not f2c as I was advised against installing f2c because of possible
conflicts. If I need it what version do I need? 

Thanks a lot
Peter Baker

     I would like to introduce R to the statistical community at large in 
     the Washington, D.C. area. I will be giving a presentation, a part of 
     which will be devoted to a discussion of R, before the Washington 
     Statistical Society (WSS) on 15 October. Anyone residing in the D.C. 
     area is welcomed to come. Also, if a developer should have plans of 
     being Washington and would like to give a presentation before the WSS 
     on R or some aspect of statistical computing in general, please notify 
     me:

     703-235-5213 ext. 170
     
     The answers to my questions will help me in preparing for my talk:
     
     1. I saw a reference to the Fullerton Library in one of the r-help     
        messages recently. What and where is it?
     
     2. Has there been developed a function like sas.get for R or can       
        the one found at statlib in the directory for S be used? 
     
     3. Shell commands like !pwd do not work on my installation of R like   
        they do for me in Splus. Does R support the use of shell commands?
     
     4. Is there a matrix library for R like the one used for Splus? Is     
        such a library needed by R?
     
     5. Is there any work being done on GUI front ends like the dialog      
        functions found in Splus?
     
     6. I learned that MathSoft intends to make its S code inaccessible for 
        use in R. Is that true, how can that be achieved, and what are the  
        implications of it in the development and use of R?
     
     7. How many developers are there that regularly contribute to the      
        development of R?
     
     8. What is R's development platform?
     
     The compilation of R on my Linux box was easy. It was troublesome, at 
     first, to compile it on a Solaris2.5 platform. Once I defined the 
     environmental variable: OPENWINHOME=/usr/openwin, the compilation 
     proceeded without a problem. I wish compilations of other software 
     were so nice.
     
     9. What is the procedure for the submission of software for R?
        Are unsolicited submissions or developed utilities not found on     
        the "TO DO" list welcomed?
     
     Thank you,

In R you have to fall back on the more basic function called
"system".  If I want to find out the current working directory I would
use
 R> system("pwd")
 /home/bates/courses/st849

Not presently.  Since the LAPACK code is freely available it would be
possible to create such a library.  If a library were being created I
would advocate going directly to a C++ implementation of the linear
algebra code, such as lapack++ or TNT (see http://math.nist.gov/tnt/)
since R can interface with C++ code.

Well, here are a few more answers:

	I have no idea!  A quick grep in library/base/help didn't turn  up
	anything.
     
>      2. Has there been developed a function like sas.get for R or can       
>         the one found at statlib in the directory for S be used? 

	No development. I don't know; I have never needed to do the translation
	but I imagine/assume that once the format of the sas files is known
	it would be easy enough to write the translator and I would start
	with the one at statlib.
      

>      5. Is there any work being done on GUI front ends like the dialog

	None that I am aware of.

	That's news to me (but not surprising news). I have no idea how
	they intend to do it. Certainly they have gotten alot of mileage out
	of contributions by others (Terry Thernau's survival package for 
	example) that needs to be open to be developed and used (at least
	initially). I imagine that too strong a move towards locking things
	up as internal code will push many academics/professionals away from
	it as a development platform. In my opinion this would be a huge
	mistake. R isn't really a competitor. R has been dubbed part of
	GNU by RMS himself.
	      
>      7. How many developers are there that regularly contribute to the      
>         development of R?

	I count 7 on the core development team. F. Leisch, K. Hornik 
	(TU Wien, Austria), Martin Maechler (ETHZ, Zurich, Switzerland),
	Peter Dalgaard ( University of Copenhagen), Ross Ihaka and myself
	(U. of Auckland, New Zealand), Thomas Lumley, (U of Washington,
	Dept of Biostats).
	We also get a lot of help from:
	 Luke Tierney, U of Minnesotta,
	 Heinrich Schwarte, Essen, Germany
	 Doug Bates, U of Wisconsin
	 Plus a host of others.
	 Whenever one starts making lists there are those that are 
	 inevitably left off; my apologies to you all.
	    
>      8. What is R's development platform?

	I'm not sure what you mean. Basically we do our primary development
	on Unix (SunOS at work and Ross uses FreeBSD at home). We then do
	our ports to Macintosh and Windows using what have become fairly 
	antiquated machines.

	Kurt and Fritz maintain the CRAN archive of software libraries that
	have been made to run under R.
	     http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/
	If you have something that works then there are some guidelines about
	how to wrap it up and it becomes part of the archive.
	R is mirrored from Auckland at a variety of sites around the world.
	People should pick it up from the site nearest them (not from us,
	we have to pay real money for every copy that goes out; yes I know
	it sounds like a silly system but they have yet to let me run the
	place)
	
	There are several mailing lists about R. The most useful is 
	r-help at stat.math.ethz.ch (which you posted to anyway).
	Bug fixes can be posted there. People who post several good
	bug fixes will soon find themselves drawn into a more active role.

I have created a new rpm which is statically linked against libf2c and
so doesn't require you to have the shared library installed. It's
called R-base-0.50.a4-2.i386.rpm. You should be able to download it from
a CRAN mirror in a day or two. There is a bug in RedHat Linux 4.0 which
means that even if you have installed the shared f2c libraries (in package
f2c-libs) the file libf2c.so.0 is not created and you get the same error
message. So unless you already know how to get round this problem (not hard,
but tedious, and common on RedHat) use the new version.

When you build R on Linux, the configure script automatically adds f2c to
the list of libraries. This means you must have the static or shared
f2c libraries installed to build R. But I'm wondering why it needs to be
linked to f2c at all. R is not supposed to require a Fortran compiler and,
indeed, it builds quite happily if you  edit the configure script and remove
the line that adds -lf2c to the list of libraries. Moreover the
statically linked version of R.binary is, in fact, smaller that the
dynamically
linked version, which suggests to me that it hasn't taken anything from
libf2c.a, but perhaps I'm being naive here.

Is this a hangover from the time when a Fortran compiler was needed to
build R?

Martyn

Fortran has always been a problem.  We have tried to keep R so that
only a C compiler is required to build and install it.  This was
partly to "be portable" and partly because getting C and Fortran to
talk to each other in a platform independent way has been too hard for
mortals like us.

This is soon going to change.  We have permission from the author of
Octave to use his configuration tools to set up R so that Fortran will
be detected and used.  If Fortran is not available (or usable) on a
given platform, f2c will be used.  I.e. you will have to have a
working Fortran or f2c in place in order to use R.

As far as I can tell, every platform which R currently runs on will be
suported by the Octave scripts.

[ There is a new version of R nearly ready to roll, but it will probably
not have the new configuration scheme in place.  All future versions
will have much better Fortran integration. ]

This just shows that it is gzip'd.  When you run gunzip on it the file
that is created is a "tar" file.  The .tgz extension came from people
getting tired of writing a .tar.gz extension.

If you have the GNU version of tar, you can expand the source
directory tree with
 tar zxf R-0.5-a4.tgz
Otherwise you have to use a two-step method of gunzip'ing it first
then running tar on the result.  That is
 gunzip R-0.50-a4.tgz
 tar xf R-0.50-a4.tar
A third alternative is
 gzip -d -c R-0.50-a4.tgz | tar xf -

BTW, I am really impressed with the general layout including the support

I am building a performance analysis system using metrics supplied by 
the
Glance package from HP ( which  also runs on a number of other

Since I am a statistics novice, I have been attracted to the procedures

There was a question earlier today, on either r-help or r-devel, about
calling R code from FORTRAN (I deleted it accidentally, so I don't know
which list it belonged to).

Anyway, there is a workaround to call R functions from FORTRAN which is
used in the "integrate" library. It was invented for S by Mike Meyer.  The
FORTRAN code needs to be written to call a fixed C function and pass it a
pointer to the R function. The C function then uses call_S to call the R
function. 

As everything is passed by reference in FORTRAN the argument is
automatically a pointer. Since the FORTRAN code never does anything with
the pointer except pass it, you can declare the argument to have any type
you like. "integrate" declares the function pointer to be DOUBLE
PRECISION. In principle on some machines there could be alignment issues,
but this would only be a problem if the FORTRAN compiler insisted on
checking the alignment of a pointer it never dereferenced.

Dear R-users,

Is anyone successfully using leaps() and particularly subsets() 
(contributed function) in R?  When I attempt to run them with modest

subsets.formula() within subsets()?

I haven't been able to cause problems like this (I'm running 0.50-a4  on
Solaris 2.5.1 and 0.50-a2 or thereabouts on Debian Linux).

What exactly happens, and do you mean "moderate"ly large or "moderate"ly
small -- I just tried the following 
	R> x<-matrix(rnorm(10000),ncol=10)
	R> subsets(x,y)->a
	R> subsets(cbind(x,x),y)->aa
with 1000 cases and 10 variables and with 20 variables with 10 exact
linear dependencies.

With 50 variables and 1000 cases I get "Error: memory exhausted" but this
can be fixed by specifying more memory at startup. With R -v20
	R> x<-matrix(rnorm(50000),ncol=50)
 	R> y<-rnorm(1000)
 	R> subsets(cbind(x,x),y,method="backward")->aa

Exhaustive search with 50 variables is not feasible, but we can
try subsets up to size 4, say.
	R> subsets(cbind(x,x),y,nvmax=4,really.big=T)->aa
This takes a long time, but doesn't crash on my system.


subsets.formula() is used automatically if the argument is a formula
object
	R> p<-rnorm(1000)
	R> q<-rep(0:1,500)
	R> subsets(y~p*q)->a
	R> summary(a)
	 Subset selection object
	Call: subsets.formula(y ~ p * q)
	3 Variables  (and intercept)
	    Forced in Forced out
	p       FALSE      FALSE
	q       FALSE      FALSE
	p.q     FALSE      FALSE
	1 subsets of each size up to 3
	Selection Algorithm: exhaustive
	         p   q   p.q
	1  ( 1 ) "*" " " " "
	2  ( 1 ) "*" " " "*"
	3  ( 1 ) "*" "*" "*"

As you can see it doesn't care about preserving hierarchical models - it
chooses p+p.q as the best model of size 2.

Thomas,

My "moderately small" dataset is an x matrix of size 250x18, certainly 
not overwhelming for the subsets() program.  Trying your simple examples 
revealed that the problem is subsets() cannot deal with character factor 
variables.  My columns look something like

      X1 X2 X3      X4
 [1,] ++ -- --   98/98
 [2,] ++ -- ++ 133/133
 [3,] ++ -- +-  133/98
 [4,] ++ -- +-  133/98
 [5,] ++ +- --   98/98
 [6,] ++ -- --   98/98
 [7,] ++ -- +- 133/133
 [8,] ++ -- +-  133/98

I'll have to convert them into appropriate numeric vectors before 
proceeding further.

Thanks for your response,

Matt

Subject: R-beta: R FAQ
Message-ID: <199710131208.OAA00476@localhost>

There have recently been several postings etc that the R FAQ provides
incorrect information.  What really is the case is that the info is
OUTDATED.  The FAQ is for version 0.49, as more or less explicitly
stated in 2.3, ``What is the Current Version of R?''.

The sort-of current Unix version of R, 0.50-a4, was meant as an alpha
version (hence the a4) rather than a full release.  By the time 0.50
could have come out, several major changes were ready for merging into
the the distribution, and we decided to put out the interim version and
incorporate the changes right away.

Unfortunately, I had already gone ahead updating the FAQ to reflect
these changes, and did not feel like undoing them and keeping 2 FAQ
versions for some time.

In any case, the new 0.60 should be released in the very near future,
and an updated version of the FAQ along with it.

Future versions of the FAQ will also have a version number which
reflects the R version number the FAQ is for.

This must be a simple question but I could not find anything under the

I am currently working on a (quite specific) set of functions I would like
to place in a library. But: I'd like to keep this separate from the R source
and CRAN libraries. Is there a global variable so that R searches also other
directories for sources when installing libraries? BTW, this can also be
handy when installing new R versions...

Any help appreciated.

In 0.60, there will be an environment variable called RLIBS, which does
exactly what you want.

Try data(airquality) and I think you'll see the light.

1st: I want to know the differences between them.

2nd: I'm interested very much in time series analysis, but watching the
html help there is not any function (for ex. like the S-Plus functions acf
pacf and arima  functions etc). If there is some pacages to plug-in with
documentation concerning how to use and install it, e-mail me please, with
installation instructions.

3rd: I whould like to know some information about the directory tree that
rseptbeta.zip and rsept.zip generate, and documentation for the pacages

* base,
* eda,
* mva,
* Rprofile,
* splines,
* survival4,
* system,

that are loadable with the "library" R function.

Thanks! Excuse me for my english!!!

this will be R 0.6) before I make it public, since I think a few things
may be changing which will affect how or where to install it.  If you
are really desparate let me know. A description of the library is
available at http://www.bank-banque-canada.ca/pgilbert but the version
of the code now on the web site does not work properly in R (or at least
didn't when I first tried it). One of the things which is not working is
the Splus pacf.

Actually, I don't even know if this is possible in Windows; I haven't used
any windows version of R recently.

In Unix, I start R by

	R -v 20
which reserves 20 Megabytes for ``vector data'' (aka `heap').

Then I can do 
	
	d.q <- dist(quakes)

d.q then contains half a million numbers and you don't want to see them !!
   
 {I think it is even more a memory problem to print it to your screen, since
  it is an object of class "dist" with its own print method
  which displays all numbers formatted nicely ...}

Subject: R-beta: more model.matrix
Message-ID: <m0xMG9k-000hgxC@franz.stat.wisc.edu>

I am trying to show some techniques to my graduate regression class.
The textbook mentioned using bootstrap samples of regression
coefficients for assessing variability.  I decided to show them
reasonably effective ways of doing the resampling.

The following is a function I wrote to create bootstrap samples of
coefficients from a fitted linear regression model.

 bsCoefSample <- 
   ## Construct a bootstrap sample of coefficients from a
   ## fitted regression model
   function(fittedModel, Nsampl, ...)
 {
   coef(fittedModel) +
     qr.coef(qr(model.matrix(fittedModel)),
	     matrix(sample(resid(fittedModel),
			   length(resid(fittedModel)) * Nsampl,
			   repl = T),
		    ncol = Nsampl))
 }

It works ok with S-PLUS but the R version of model.matrix encounters
difficulties. 

 R> fm1 <- lm(y ~ x.1 + x.2 + x.3 + x.4 + x.5, data = e3.7, model = T)
 R> summary(fm1)

 Call:
 lm(formula = y ~ x.1 + x.2 + x.3 + x.4 + x.5, data = e3.7, model = T)

 R> fm1Sampl <- bsCoefSample(fm1, 500)

Can anyone suggest a modified function that would work in both S-PLUS
and R?

It appears that model.matrix is a generic in S-PLUS
 S-PLUS> methods(model.matrix)
 $SHOME/stat/.Functions $SHOME/stat/.Functions 
 "model.matrix.default" "model.matrix.lm"     

Could this be done in R as well?  I am willing to try to do that if
it seems like a good idea.

We can define 

model.matrix.lm<-function(lmobj){
	model.matrix(delete.response(terms(lmobj)),model.frame(lmobj))
}

so that an explicit call to model.matrix.lm instead of model.matrix would
work in both R and S.  It might well be a good idea to make model.matrix
generic. 

Another option is to use update(,qr=T) to refit the model and return the
qr decomposition.  This is a bit more tricky, since you need to evaluate
things in the right environment.

Hi,



I am currently trying to switch from Splus to R and I would like to know
whether there is a way of transfering Splus objects stored on disk into the R
environment. In Splus I would do this using the function get, e.g., foo <-
get(foo,where="dirname") where dirname is the name of a directory containing
the Splus objects. In R, argument 'where' of function get appears to be
replaced by argument 'envir', whose meaning is rather nebulous for me at the
moment.....
Thanks for answering me. Sorry if this question has been already asked zillion
of times, as it is likely to have been.

not quite a zillion....

I think the new (not-yet-released) version of the FAQ will help you quite a
bit more here [[I assume you looked at the current released FAQ ...]]

Big difference  S <-> R:

	In S / Splus, objects are stored as single files in Data directories.
	  (at least conceptually, in S-plus Windows, this is not quite true..).

	In R,	they are only stored in memory, or as part of the ``image'',
	when you use  save(..)  or q("yes")
	{{and they are reloaded automatically if the image is called
		".RData" and is in your current directory,
	  or by  load(...) explicitly.}}

  Most of ``us'' however use source files and source(..) 
	(and Emacs S-mode / R-mode ...) for our own functions and things.
  If you use HUGE data sets, R is not really there yet with
   ``memory-mapped'' objects.
	  
Solution of your problem:
	Get your data and function into R, using

		source(.)
		scan(.)
	and/or  read.table(.).

	To this end, you must save your S-plus objects in the proper format
	from WITHIN S-plus, 
	using  dump(..) [then you'll use source(..)]
	or     write(..) / write.table(..), then use scan(.) or read.table(.). 

I hope this helps.

R does not read the Splus data storage format.  To transport objects
between Splus and R, I've used dump() in Splus to save the object in a
text file, and then use source() in R to read it in.

The internal representations of objects in S-PLUS and R are similar,
but different.  The "get" function as you have used it above retrieves
the internal representation of the object.  It is unlikely that a
method could be constructed for R that would make sense of all such
S-PLUS objects.

You may have better luck using a combination of "ed" in S-PLUS and
"source" in R or, even better, use the emacs modes from the ESS (Emacs
Speaks Statistics) library (ftp://ftp.math.sc.edu/rossini/) to run
S-PLUS in one buffer and R in another buffer.  In the S-PLUS buffer
you dump the object in a printable form then from that buffer you load
the object into the R process.

This may sound confusing but the basic idea is that you have to go to
some printable form of the object so you can transfer it from one
system to the other.

One thing I would like to see is the ability of R to parse the
data.dump format of objects created by S.  Has anyone looked at this
at all?

Not yet.  Would you like to write them :-).

I am planning a pass through the modelling stuff in the near (?)
future.  "aov" and related functions are about third on the list after
beefed up graphics/gui and a Mac version.

Yup. But be careful not to do it with objects that have a different
format in R. .Random.seed is a vector of length 3 in R but length 12
in Splus, for instance... So dump(ls()) is a bit risky.

I don't think so, but it looks pretty trivial, insofar as the internal
format is the same in the two languages. Basically, it seems to be the
object structure converted to prefix notation, with a few shortcuts
for the operators (<- is not coded in the same way as a function named
"<-" would be).

Incidentally, Splus 3.4 has a bug with "<-"-expressions:
> expression("<-"(y,3))
expression("<-" <- y)
(it's only in the deparsing, internal structure and function is OK)

Martin's reply to Jean-Francois' question is pretty complete, but I suspect what 
JF and other new users want is 'how to transfer the *whole* of my Splus .Data 
(or _Data on PC)  workspace into R' rather than just certain functions/data.

In correspondence some months ago Peter Dalgaard and I came up with

Splus:
> dump(objects(),"dumpfile")

R:
> source("dumpfile")

or

OS-prompt% R < dumpfile

It does not always work, though, because R and S are not the same language, eg 
not all your Splus functions will work as-is. In particular, before doing the 
Splus dump, you should rm(last.warning,last.dump) and anything else source() is 
going to have trouble parsing.

Subject: R-beta: R rules!
Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.3.95.971021104533.13188A-100000@io.uwinnipeg.ca>

I am a long-time Mac user.  R is way behind on that platform, which is one
reason why I decided to try out Linux on intel.  I have the system set up
and have installed R (using Slackware, which is only distribution my tech
services wants me to use). It went very smoothly, thanks everyone behind
R!

I installed R in the directory
/usr/local/bin/R-0.50-a4/
Not sure if this is a sensible set-up.

Then I copied the shell script R (shows up in directory of
/usr/local/bin/R-0.50-a4/
as
R*
not as R)
as suggested to
/usr/local/bin/R

Typing R works if I cd to /usr/local/bin/R.  But if I am elsewhere it
doesn't work.  Is there a way (like MSDOS path) to set it up so that I can
be anywhere and type R to invoke it?

Thanks very much for any help.

It's probably better not to put the whole source tree in /usr/local/bin/,
which is where programs live.  It doesn't really matter, but I would
suggest /usr/local/R-0.50-a4 or /usr/local/src/R-0.50-a4

Do you mean that you copied the R file to the directory /usr/local/bin/R/?
If so, that is the problem.  You should have copied the file to the
directory /usr/local/bin/ using a command like

	% cp /usr/local/bin/R-0.50-a4/bin/R /usr/local/bin/R

The directory /usr/local/bin/ is almost certainly in your path, but
/usr/local/bin/R/ will not be.  You can set your path, which is an
environment variable. The details depend on which shell you use. The
command is setenv for the tcsh shell.

You might want to suggest to your tech services people that they look
at the RedHat or Debian distributions of Linux.  Slackware is pretty
ancient and not the greatest quality.  Those who have used several
different distributions generally feel that the package maintenance
systems on both RedHat and Debian are superior to that on Slackware.

It would be more common to put it in something like
 /usr/local/lib/R-0.50-a4/

Yes, you should have a PATH environment variable and that should have
/usr/local/bin listed in it. (MSDOS copied the idea from Unix, not the 
other way around).  Try
 echo $PATH
from the shell.  It should look something like
 $ echo $PATH
 /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/home/bates/bin

If not, add /usr/local/bin to the PATH environment variable in .cshrc
(if you use the C-shell) or in .profile for other shells.  The syntax
for the .profile file is like
 PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
 export PATH

Hi All,

I'm really glad to hear that R rules on Linux, because Linux rules 
everywhere else.

If time allows, the effort is well worth while to create an "rpm" file.

rpm is the default package hanlder created by RedHat Linux, which is the 
most popular Linux package.  Generally packages are now most commonly 
stored in /opt/R, /usr/R, /home/R, /home/<machname>/R, or /usr/local/R.

/opt is the latest craze and having been adopted by the major vendors is 
will probably last past the millenia.

rpm is a command and a *.rpm file is an installable cross between a tgz 
and an self extracting *.exe file.  To reinterate, it is a star product 
and in the copy-left.  It interfaces with the Caldera owned LISA ( Linux 
Installation and Sys Admin App ).  Slack, Redhat, and Caldera are all 
good products, though I favor Caldera becuase it will very likely be the 
first Linux to be accepted in the Corp. arena.

BTW, I am still trying to get R running on HPUX; I am missing the X 
libraries, which is moot to me because I plan to use R as a co-process 
to a perl multithreading dataserver which will be getting data on the 
STDIN and writing to shared persistant objects.  Since R is only one 
piece of that and I will have to wait to get the other parts, not to 
mention my crash course in stats, I am in no hurry.  None-the-less 
advice here would be welcome.

John van V.

....

Isn't there an English proverb about "preaching to the prophet"? We
know... Essentially the same superlatives can be applied to the Debian
package system. Someone already did make some unofficial .rpm and
.dpkg files. However, it is probably best to hold back just a little
while longer before issuing an "official" set. There are some rather
substantial changes in directory layout and contributed-package
management coming up, and if a .rpm file with the old layout should
find its way onto the mass-produced CD's we'll find ourselves
answering questions about things that don't work with it forever...

Oh dear, I suppose we'd better get that HAVE_X11 conditionalization
code back in the source. It got "cleaned up" at some point because it
didn't work, but I suppose it had been better to make it work. I ran
into the same problem while trying to cross-compile a DOS version, and
I suspect there will also be people wanting a no-X11 version for
laptops and other cramped systems. 

It's not all *that* hard to get it to compile by stripping out
X11-specific routines and calls. Basically, keep typing 'make' and
remove whatever gets in the way...

There are a lot of Linux users here. This may have something to do
with the fact that Mathsoft declined to port S-PLUS to Linux.

I already did this. The rpm packages are still experimental however
and the current rpm is an alpha release of R. It doesn't make much
sense to create prepackaged versions of software releases which are
intended for hackers (mea culpa), so after the next beta
release I shall only release rpm versions of beta or stable versions.

This might be a good place to point out that the R rpms are "relocatable".
The default installation is in the /usr directory
(RHOME in /usr/lib/R, binary in /usr/bin, man page in /usr/man/man1,
documentation in /usr/doc) but you can change this with the --root
option.  Of course you must have your environment variables set up
correctly.

Possibly. They are doing a brilliant job of attracting commercial
software to Linux and expanding it into new markets, but I decided
not to use Caldera OpenLinux because
1 Unlike RedHat and Debian, they are not technological leaders
2          "              , they do not have a commitment to free
  software.
3 We tried OpenLinux Base 1.0 and were a bit disappointed by the
  age of some of the packages.
4 The desktop is nothing to get excited about

This is getting a little off-topic, so I'll stop.

Good. I'll put the current version on my ftp server ftp-fis.iarc.fr
next week (The ftp server is lying in pieces at the moment because I
am in the middle of a hardware and software upgrade). CODA doesn't
work at all at the moment because I changed the way Markov Chains are
represented.  They are now R "objects" similar to S-PLUS "rts"
time series, but they are 3-dimensional arrays (iterations x variables
x chains).  This seems like the best choice of data structure to me
but if someone else has thought more deeply about this tell me now
before I rewrite all my code!

If anybody else wants to help then write to me. (My real address

Yes, and it doesn't work on Slackware and possibly other Linux
Installations. It also insists on its own very idiosyncratic directory

If RedHat users want their .rpm files - fine.
However do keep up the .tar.gz file format, which needs only standard unix
utilities for its use.

I fail to se the point of this discussion ... the sources will always
be available as tar-files only because they are platform-independent.

the idea of providing binary packages via CRAN is to ease the
installation for as many platforms as possible ... so if for your
favourite platform/distribution combination there are packages at CRAN
-> fine grab and install them.

if there are none: there simply wasn't any volunteer for making
them. if you got working packages, simply put them in the incoming
directory at

	ftp://ftp.ci.tuwien.ac.at

and drop a note to

	sysadmin at ci.tuwien.ac.at


There is NO POLICY behind which packages are on CRAN, there are simply
ONLY THOSE SUBMITTED BY SOMEBODY. E.g., there are Debian packages
because we use debian and put them onto CRAN.

Best,
Fritz

I don't think restart() is necessary - it just seems like an invitation
to bad programming to me. I would, however, like a safe parse function
which would return a user-defined error code instead of crashing if
the input is invalid.  Such a function could then be safely called
from another function and allow very general user input.

Thanks once again everyone who helped.  I first tried just changing the
directory structure, but that didn't work.  So then I deleted everything
and started over.  But then I ran into problems becuase I tried to install
the software into /usr/local/Rblahblah as wsimpson.  So I became su, and
the problems persisted.  Finally I deleted everything again and logging in
as root prior to installation.  That time it worked.  So I learned:
- log in as root prior to installation
- su not same as root

Best wishes,
Bill
PS on Slackware vs other distributions.  I agree Debian or RedHat were my
preferences, since the package management appears to be a big plus.  I
actually installed RedHat to begin with. I ran into problems installing
the network card my tech services told me to buy, [plug and play
problems!] so had to wind up asking them for help and they installed
Slackware.

As has been pointed out there are already .rpm and .deb packages for
R-0.50-a4 on the CRAN archives.

I have contributed an xlispstat package to the official collection of
packages for Debian Linux.  (If you are looking for it, it is in the
unstable distribution because new packages are not generally added to
the stable distribution.  Send me e-mail if you want to try to use it
because converting to unstable is not trivial.)  As part of providing
the xlispstat package I registered as an official Debian developer.

I have held off making an official Debian package of R-0.50 because I
understand that there will be substantial changes in the organization
of the 0.60 release and that release is due out "real soon".  Once
0.60 hits the streets I will try to make a Debian package of it.  If
someone else wants to do that, please let me know and we can
coordinate.  I don't feel that i have to be the official converter - I
am happy to let someone else do it if they want.

A Debian package can be converted to a .rpm file.  I think it ends up
containing all the information that a native .rpm file contains.  That
may be a quick way to get a .rpm file for those who want that format.

For R I will try to create both "stable" (i.e. Debian 1.3.1) and
"unstable" (Debian 2.0) packages.  Only the "unstable" will be
officially distributed as part of Debian.

Martyn

A couple of years ago I wrote a kernel of routines for handling the time
dimension of objects. In part this was prompted by StatSci's
introduction of rts, etc., which caused a number of problems in my code,
at least if I wanted to take advantage of these new time representation.
The idea of this kernel is that it allows me to use different
representrations without having to change much. I just have to add a few
methods to deal with the new time representation.

If time is an important aspect of your objects you might want to look at
this code. It is somewhat experimental, but it has worked very well for
me with my fairly large library of routines for time series analysis.
Attached below is some more explaination. Let me know is you want the
code.

Paul Gilbert
________________
<H2>Description</H2>
<UL>
Generic methods for handling time.
</UL>
<H2>Details</H2>
<UL>
<I>tframe</I> objects implement a scheme for using classes and methods
to handle different time representations in S. This provides a method
by which code can be developed without too much dependence on the
representation of time. For example, many time series programs only use
the fact that data is arranged sequentially. On the other hand, putting
the time axis label on a plot will require a method which is specific
to the time representation.<P>

While the primary purpose of this class and its methods is to allow
code to me more robust with respect to other (and future)
improved/different representations of time, the methods also provide a
simple way to fix some inconsistency which may occur with the current
mix of possible time representations.<P>

The classes and methods associated with the implementation of rts, cts
and its in Splus accomplish some of these objectives. The attempt here
is further separate the time representation from the data to allow a
statement like

<BR>
tframe(x) <- tframe(y)
<BR>

to make the time frame of x the same as that of y, without the need to
worry about what time representation is used in y (eg. tsp, rts, cts,
its, ...). In this assignment x and y need not be too similar (eg - one
might be a univariate series while the other is a matrix or an array or
list of spatial or panel time series data), as long as they are similar
in the time dimension.<P>

This is accomplished by assigning an attribute of the data called
"tframe" and giving that attribute a class so that methods can be
applied to it. Doing this in a generic way allows for the possibility
of future classes of time representation. This is different from the
way that rts, cts and its are implemented, in the sense that it is the
tframe attribute of the data which is assigned a class indicating the
time representation, not the data object itself.<P>

The most general (last) class of the "tframe" attribute should be
"tframe".
The method "is.tframe"  checks if an object is of class tframe, and
the method "is.tframed" checks if an object has an attribute "tframe" of

class tframe. In general, tframe methods act on the time frame (tframe)
and
tframed methods act on data which is tframed.<P>

More specific methods can be defined for any special time
representation (eg. below methods are defined for tframes of class
c("tsp", "tframe") which are the old style tsp convention for time).
Also, below, is an untested sketch of an implementaion for rts, cts,
its and a class and methods style implementation of tsp called ts.<P>

See the section "tframe  methods" below for some methods which should be

supported. In particular, start(), end(), and periods() should be
supported methods for any object of class tframe. (and until I make a
lot
of changes in my code, frequency is important.)<P>

One implication of the desire to be able to use a statement like
tframe(x) <- tframe(y)
is that the tframe should not indicate which dim of the data is the
time dimension. In general this will have to be another attribute of
the data, but the current convention of using the first dimension for
matrix data and the length for vector data, makes it unnecessary to
specify.<P>

Operations which should be possible on tframe'd data:
  In the time dimension
     - window, splice
  In other dimensions
     -bind  with shift to align the the tframe
                 (and NA pad.start, pad.end, pad=T/F)
     - []   without losing the tframe

Subject: R-beta: why restart()
Message-ID: <199710231535.QAA16161@scmp.scm.liverpool.ac.uk>

Martyn, you write

> I don't think restart() is necessary  - it just seems like an invitation to
> bad programming to me. 

It's needed when comparing, say, the time to convergence (if at all) of various 
iterative processes, for each of a few hundred simulated values. For example one 
wants basically

function(data){
	summary<-rep(NA,1000)
	for(i in 1:1000){
		results1<-prog1(data[i])
		results2<-prog2(data[i])
		.
		.
		.
		summary[i] <- f(results1,results2,...)
	}
	summary
}

where prog1, say, can sometimes fail fatally, for certain data values. The 
*object of the exercise* is to find out what values cause program i to crash but 
program j to run ok.

One can use immediate assigns (in Splus - haven't tried in R cos this study 
needs a restart() function!) so that at least results pre-crash are stored. But 
I want to study cases where 90% of all the cases fail fatally; it would never 
get off the ground.

I accept that if you know what will cause the fatal fail you can program in a 
test for it --- sometimes. What about this one: likely fatal error due to 
solve(mat,x) having nonsingular matrix. Yes, yes, check there aren't any zeros 
on the diagonal of the SVD ... but mine are 512x512 matrices.

It isn't efficient programming to completely re-write solve (or indeed to 
re-write any built-in) with it's built-in fatal return changed to an error 
return, and it isn't efficient to run solve if you're going to do an explicit 
SVD in the first place. It *is* efficient to call try(solve()) where try is

function(expr, first = T)
{
# return either the proper answer to expr or NA (length 1), 
# with printed error message. See splus_break for a version
# that returns error message as structure.
#
# DO NOT USE THE 'first' ARGUMENT
        restart(first)
        if(first) {
                first <- F
                expr
        }
        else {
# get_last_message doesn't always get the error message ...
                print(paste("ERROR:", .C("get_last_message",
                        "")[[1]]))
                NA
        }
}

Thanks to someone whose name I have lost for posting this one to s-news.

Then you also get try(parse()).

Actually, I agree that self-written functions shouldn't need try(), you should 
build in error handling. It's the built-in functions that make me suggest 
restart() is `necessary'. The built-ins have error handling, but not under my 
control.

I think some way of trapping errors in arbitrary functions would be
useful.  The problem is that someone else may have written the code, in
which case bemoaning their bad programming practices is a little
unproductive.  I have had a lot of trouble with simulations of a
function that crashes with a "singular matrix" about 10% of the time. In S
I could at least use a For() loop, which would skip over the errors. In R
I can't do this. If I run in batch mode I can't even restart the
simulation automatically since R stops on all errors.

The only problem is that the R scoping rules make it impossible to
guarantee that you can recover completely after an error.  Changes may
have been made to existing environments.  This is rare enough that we can
probably live with it -- especially as the main reason to trap errors
would be in self-contained code written by someone else.

 Having just gone through a conversion from Slackware to RedHat I am not so sure
that "tech services people" would necessarily agree with this assessment. RedHat
has a very nice "end user" installation procedure (but you still have to be a
fairly techie end user) starting to approach the simplicty of a Windows install.
If you only have one machine, and especially if it is not connected to a
network, then RedHat (or Debian) is probably a clear winner over Slackware. But
if you're supporting a lot of systems I think it may have some disadvantages. I
haven't used RedHat very long yet, but I can already see a few things I think
would be a problem if I was trying to support a network larger than the few
machines I have at home. The reason is not so much that Slackware is good, but
more that you don't really use it after you get one machine set up. I'm not
really sure how easy that is with RedHat.

On monday (assigments marked, exam ready :-) I will be starting a careful
rewrite of the parser.  This is mainly intended to support an X GUI, but
it will have the side effect of fixing the behavior you describe.

Ross,

   Does implementing a gui for R mean we will be able to use dialog boxes?
That would be nice.

  There is a locator function which interacts with a plot window 
currently, will there also be brush and spin plots?  Xlispstat seems to 
do those better than Splus, so I've wondered if R (being lisp-based) will 
have an advantage there.

  Perhaps I'm missing the point of an X gui.  What are the goals for the 
gui?

Silly me thinking solve code wasn't accessible in R (cos it isn't in S-PLUS). All you 
need is a tiny edit:

> mysolve
function (a, b, tol = 1e-07) 
{
        if (!is.qr(a)) 
                a <- qr(a, tol = tol)
        nc <- ncol(a$qr)
        if (a$rank != nc) {
                warning("singular matrix \'a\' in solve")
                return(rep(NA, nc))
        }
        if (missing(b)) {
                if (nc != nrow(a$qr)) {
                        warning("only square matrices can be inverted")
                        return(rep(NA, nc))
                }
                b <- diag(1, nc)
        }
        b <- as.matrix(b)
        return(qr.coef(a, b))
}

Well, not quite all; if b is the wrong length, you'll still get a fatal error 
from qr.coef, but that's just as easily edited.

Advise Jim (and anybody else) to edit nlm into mynlm with a call to mysolve (and 
a subsequent test that !is.na(ans[1]); you might get very strange 
compatability/porting problems if you overwrite the default solve.

Subject: R-beta: Expokit - Matrix Exponential Kit
Message-ID: <3454044B.4129@maths.uq.edu.au>

Expokit is a set of user-friendly routines (in FORTRAN 77 and MATLAB)
aimed at computing matrix exponentials. More precisely, it computes
either a small matrix exponential in full, the action of a large
sparse matrix exponential on an operand vector, or the solution of a
system of linear ODEs with constant inhomogeneity. The computation
of small dense matrix exponentials is based on the rational Chebyshev
approximation or the irreducible Pade approximation combined with
the scaling-and-squaring technique. The backbone of the sparse 
routines consists of matrix-free Krylov subspace projection methods
(Arnoldi and Lanczos processes) and that is why the toolkit is capable
of coping with sparse matrices of very large dimension. The software
handles real and complex matrices and provides tailored routines for 
symmetric and Hermitian matrices. When dealing with Markov chains, 
the computation of the matrix exponential is subject to probabilistic
constraints. In addition to addressing general matrix exponentials, 
a distinct attention is assigned to the computation of transient 
states of Markov chains. Expokit is the first comprehensive package
specifically design for matrix exponentials from the outset. Current
users of the package find it very fast, easy-to-use, and useful. 
Expokit is self-contained and a number of sample drivers are 
included that illustrate its utilization.

                                INTERNET

                   http://www.maths.uq.edu.au/expokit

The work resulting from Expokit has been accepted for publication
in ACM-TOMS (Transactions On Mathematical Software). We are considering
submitting the code itself to ACM-CALGO (Collected Algorithms). In order
to strengthen the robustness and reliability of the software, comments 
and bugs that users might have will be appreciated.

Just to clarify: The 'stable' distribution does not get augmented by new (and

current development-in-progress. Once all issues with the development
distribution are ironed out, 'unstable' is released and becomes the new
'stable'. So R will officially be distributed by Debian on the upcoming 2.0
release (no timeline; Debian is often a little late with releases anyway).

The current work on 'unstable' aka Debian 2.0 comprises, among other things,
the conversion to libc6 which takes some time to resolve. That's why it's a
good idea to offer libc5 (== Debian 1.3) versions of R once 0.60 is out.

Looking forward to working with Douglas' R packages!

Subject: R-beta: Assigning column names in a data frame
Message-ID: <m0xQF50-000hruC@franz.stat.wisc.edu>

You may recall that I was recently constructing a function to
bootstrap the coefficients in a linear regression model.  In S-PLUS I
was using the model.matrix function applied to the fitted model, then
taking the QR decomposition of that.  I discovered that it was in fact
easier to accomplish the bootstrapping in R because the QR
decomposition of the model matrix is stored with the fitted model.

So far, so good.  Then I got fancy and returned the result as a
data frame.

"bsCoefSample" <- 
  ## Construct a bootstrap sample of coefficients from a
  ## fitted regression model
  function(fittedModel, Nsampl)
{
  value <-
    as.data.frame(t(coef(fittedModel) +
		    qr.coef(fittedModel$qr,
			    matrix(sample(resid(fittedModel),
					  length(resid(fittedModel)) * Nsampl,
					  repl = T),
				   ncol = Nsampl))))
  names(value) <- names(coef(fittedModel))
  value
}

Later I thought I could cut this down a bit more by assigning the
column names to the data frame as it was being created.  It would look 
like

"bsCoefSample" <- 
  ## Construct a bootstrap sample of coefficients from a
  ## fitted regression model
  function(fittedModel, Nsampl)
{
  as.data.frame(t(coef(fittedModel) +
		  qr.coef(fittedModel$qr,
			  matrix(sample(resid(fittedModel),
					length(resid(fittedModel)) * Nsampl,
					repl = T),
				 ncol = Nsampl))),
		col.names = names(coef(fittedModel)))
}

but that doesn't work.  Apparently the column names are being applied
to the frame before the call to .Internal(data.frame(...)) in the
data.frame function.  At that point the frame argument has length 1
instead of the number of columns it will eventually have.

A more simple example to illustrate this is
 R> ttt <- matrix(rnorm(10), ncol = 2)
 R> dim(as.data.frame(ttt))
 [1] 5 2
 R> as.data.frame(ttt, col.names = c("x", "y"))
 Error: names attribute must be the same length as the vector

The R-like language marketed by MathSoft does not provide for a
col.names argument in the as.data.frame function.
