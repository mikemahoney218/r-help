Perhaps you are looking for something like the plot produced by

example(TukeyHSD)

For this you would need confidence intervals for each pairwise
comparison, not just the p-values. Once you have those, recreating the
plot should not be difficult, but I don't know if there is any package
that already does this for you. E.g., car::leveneTest() etc. are
designed for multiple groups and won't give you confidence intervals.

Since you're not getting replies here, it might help to contact
maintainer('imputeTS').

I think that ABNORMAL_TERMINATION_IN_LNSRCH happens when the line
search part of the L-BFGS-B algorithm determines that the directional
derivative of the function being optimised along the direction of the
previous step turns out to be positive, meaning that the step direction
was bad in the first place. There may be many reasons for this to
happen.

It might also help to look at the optimisation process by passing the
optim.control = list(trace = 3) argument (available levels are 1 to 6,
with 6 being very verbose).

Ivan

Subject: [R] Associate a .R file with the RGui
Message-ID: <3095309c.153f5.1843ee50418.Webtop.109@btinternet.com>


Hi,


My OS is Windows 11 Pro 64-Bit, I have R 4.2.2 and RStudio installed.

If I double-click on a .R file in File Explorer the OS gives me the 
option of opening the .R in RStudio, or Look for an app in the Microsoft 
Store, or More Apps. Similarly with a right-click.

I would like to associate a .R file with the RGui, not RStudio, thus 
when I double-click on a .R file in File Explorer the .R file opens in 
the R Editor in RGui.

On my PC R 4.2.2 is located in "C:/Program Files/R/R-4.2.2/etc"

Please can someone provide step-by-step instructions on how to 
associate?


thanks,
Amarjit

Hi 

another option is to use SendTo folder. This was easy to find in older
Windows versions. Now the easiest way is:

Press the Windows Key + R to trigger the Run window. At the Open field in
the window, type shell:SendTo and then click OK

And SendTo folder should open.

You can then add link to any application here so add RGui link

After that, rightclick on file .RData file and menu with option SendTo opens
with RGui one of the options.

I learned it before ages and it is quite usefull not only in this case.

Here is link to another explanation.

Subject: [R] data frame returned from sapply but vector expected
Message-ID: <eba27eb500454f08b5d7c647f3c4cb64@SRVEXCHCM1302.precheza.cz>

Hallo all

 

I found a strange problem for coding if part of list is NULL. 

In this case, sapply result is ***list of data frames*** but if there is no
NULL leaf, the result is ***list of vectors***. 

I tried simplify option but it did not help me neither I found anything in
help page. 

 

The code is part of bigger project where I fill list by reading in data and
if it fails, the leaf is set to NULL. Then the the boxplot is created simply
by

boxplot(sapply(mylist2, "[", "b")) and the user is asked to select if values
should be rbinded or not.

 

Is it possible to perform some *apply without getting data frame as result
in case NULL leaf?

 

Here is an example (without boxplot)

 

df1 <- data.frame(a=rnorm(5), b=runif(5), c=rlnorm(5))

df2 <- data.frame(a=rnorm(5), b=runif(5), c=rlnorm(5))

mylist1 <- list(df1,df2, df3)

mylist2 <- list(NULL,df2, df3)

> str(sapply(mylist1, "[", "b"))

List of 3

$ b: num [1:5] 0.387 0.69 0.876 0.836 0.819

$ b: num [1:5] 0.01733 0.46055 0.19421 0.11609 0.00789

$ b: num [1:5] 0.593 0.478 0.299 0.185 0.847

> str(sapply(mylist2, "[", "b"))

List of 3

$ : NULL

$ :'data.frame':       5 obs. of  1 variable:

Is sapply(mylist2, `[[`, 'b') closer to what you'd like to see, i.e. a
list of vectors or NULLs?

Wait, that would simplify the return value into a matrix when there are
no NULLs. But lapply(mylist2, `[[`, 'b') should work in both cases,
which in my opinion goes to show the dangers of using simplifying
functions in to-be-library code.

Sorry for the double-post!

Hallo Ivan

Thanks, yes it seems to be working. I thought also removing NULL by

mylist2[sapply(mylist2, is.null)] <- NULL

but your approach is probably better (in any case simpler)

Thanks again.

I have a 48 core processor. My question is, how do i loop through the cores without explicitly mentioning the core numbers?
Will this work?



library(parallel)
cl <- makeCluster(4)
clusterExport(cl, "foo")
cores <- seq_along(cl)
r <- clusterApply(cl[cores], cores, function(core) {

  for(i in 1:48) {

      if (core ==i) {

        foo( x[i] )

}
}
})

Many thanks in advance......

Thanking you,
Your sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

You don't specify processors. Just invoke the worker functions with the relevant packages and they will be allocated according to how you defined the cluster object... typically automatically. Processors are usually specified (to the cluster object) according to IP address. Cores within the processors are allocated according to how many processes are created.

Maybe you should read some documentation (vignettes), and/or look into R-sig-hpc (https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-hpc). This is probably not the best place to pursue this.

dear Jeff,
                 Yeah, you are right.....just went through the documentation and found out that clusterApplyLB() from parallel package does the job... Thanks again....

THanking you,
Yours sincerely
