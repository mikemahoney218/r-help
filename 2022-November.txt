Perhaps you are looking for something like the plot produced by

example(TukeyHSD)

For this you would need confidence intervals for each pairwise
comparison, not just the p-values. Once you have those, recreating the
plot should not be difficult, but I don't know if there is any package
that already does this for you. E.g., car::leveneTest() etc. are
designed for multiple groups and won't give you confidence intervals.

Since you're not getting replies here, it might help to contact
maintainer('imputeTS').

I think that ABNORMAL_TERMINATION_IN_LNSRCH happens when the line
search part of the L-BFGS-B algorithm determines that the directional
derivative of the function being optimised along the direction of the
previous step turns out to be positive, meaning that the step direction
was bad in the first place. There may be many reasons for this to
happen.

It might also help to look at the optimisation process by passing the
optim.control = list(trace = 3) argument (available levels are 1 to 6,
with 6 being very verbose).

Ivan

Subject: [R] Associate a .R file with the RGui
Message-ID: <3095309c.153f5.1843ee50418.Webtop.109@btinternet.com>


Hi,


My OS is Windows 11 Pro 64-Bit, I have R 4.2.2 and RStudio installed.

If I double-click on a .R file in File Explorer the OS gives me the 
option of opening the .R in RStudio, or Look for an app in the Microsoft 
Store, or More Apps. Similarly with a right-click.

I would like to associate a .R file with the RGui, not RStudio, thus 
when I double-click on a .R file in File Explorer the .R file opens in 
the R Editor in RGui.

On my PC R 4.2.2 is located in "C:/Program Files/R/R-4.2.2/etc"

Please can someone provide step-by-step instructions on how to 
associate?


thanks,
Amarjit

Hi 

another option is to use SendTo folder. This was easy to find in older
Windows versions. Now the easiest way is:

Press the Windows Key + R to trigger the Run window. At the Open field in
the window, type shell:SendTo and then click OK

And SendTo folder should open.

You can then add link to any application here so add RGui link

After that, rightclick on file .RData file and menu with option SendTo opens
with RGui one of the options.

I learned it before ages and it is quite usefull not only in this case.

Here is link to another explanation.

Subject: [R] data frame returned from sapply but vector expected
Message-ID: <eba27eb500454f08b5d7c647f3c4cb64@SRVEXCHCM1302.precheza.cz>

Hallo all

 

I found a strange problem for coding if part of list is NULL. 

In this case, sapply result is ***list of data frames*** but if there is no
NULL leaf, the result is ***list of vectors***. 

I tried simplify option but it did not help me neither I found anything in
help page. 

 

The code is part of bigger project where I fill list by reading in data and
if it fails, the leaf is set to NULL. Then the the boxplot is created simply
by

boxplot(sapply(mylist2, "[", "b")) and the user is asked to select if values
should be rbinded or not.

 

Is it possible to perform some *apply without getting data frame as result
in case NULL leaf?

 

Here is an example (without boxplot)

 

df1 <- data.frame(a=rnorm(5), b=runif(5), c=rlnorm(5))

df2 <- data.frame(a=rnorm(5), b=runif(5), c=rlnorm(5))

mylist1 <- list(df1,df2, df3)

mylist2 <- list(NULL,df2, df3)

> str(sapply(mylist1, "[", "b"))

List of 3

$ b: num [1:5] 0.387 0.69 0.876 0.836 0.819

$ b: num [1:5] 0.01733 0.46055 0.19421 0.11609 0.00789

$ b: num [1:5] 0.593 0.478 0.299 0.185 0.847

> str(sapply(mylist2, "[", "b"))

List of 3

Is sapply(mylist2, `[[`, 'b') closer to what you'd like to see, i.e. a
list of vectors or NULLs?

Wait, that would simplify the return value into a matrix when there are
no NULLs. But lapply(mylist2, `[[`, 'b') should work in both cases,
which in my opinion goes to show the dangers of using simplifying
functions in to-be-library code.

Sorry for the double-post!

Hallo Ivan

Thanks, yes it seems to be working. I thought also removing NULL by

mylist2[sapply(mylist2, is.null)] <- NULL

but your approach is probably better (in any case simpler)

Thanks again.

I have a 48 core processor. My question is, how do i loop through the cores without explicitly mentioning the core numbers?
Will this work?



library(parallel)
cl <- makeCluster(4)
clusterExport(cl, "foo")
cores <- seq_along(cl)
r <- clusterApply(cl[cores], cores, function(core) {

  for(i in 1:48) {

      if (core ==i) {

        foo( x[i] )

}
}
})

Many thanks in advance......

Thanking you,

You don't specify processors. Just invoke the worker functions with the relevant packages and they will be allocated according to how you defined the cluster object... typically automatically. Processors are usually specified (to the cluster object) according to IP address. Cores within the processors are allocated according to how many processes are created.

Maybe you should read some documentation (vignettes), and/or look into R-sig-hpc (https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-hpc). This is probably not the best place to pursue this.

dear Jeff,
                 Yeah, you are right.....just went through the documentation and found out that clusterApplyLB() from parallel package does the job... Thanks again....

THanking you,

Hello,

What I want to do is, for each point, identify all points within 50m of that point, find the minimum value of the "Conc" attribute of each nearby set of points (including the original point) and then create a new variable ("Conc_min") and assign this minimum value to a new variable added to "data".

So far, I have the following code:

library(spdep)
library(sf)

setwd("C:\\mydirectory\\")
data<- read.csv("R_find_pts_testdata.csv")

#make sure the data is a data frame
pts <- data.frame(data)

#create spatial data frame and define projection
pts_coords <- cbind(pts$LON, pts$LAT)
data_pts <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(coords= pts_coords,
data=pts, proj4string = CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"))

#Re-project to WGS 84 / UTM zone 18N, so the analysis is in units of m
ptsUTM  <- sf::st_as_sf(data_pts, coords = c("LAT", "LON"), remove = F)%>% st_transform(32618)

#create 50 m buffer around each point then intersect with points and finally find neighbors within the buffers
pts_buf <- sf::st_buffer(ptsUTM, 50)
coords  <- sf::st_coordinates(ptsUTM)
int <- sf::st_intersects(pts_buf, ptsUTM)
x   <- spdep::dnearneigh(coords, 0, 50)

Now at this point, I'm not sure what to either the "int" (a sgbp list) or "x" (nb object) objects (or even if I need them both)

> int
Sparse geometry binary predicate list of length 974, where the predicate was `intersects'
first 10 elements:
 1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ...
 2: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ...
 3: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ...

 9: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ...

> x

Number of regions: 974
Number of nonzero links: 34802
Percentage nonzero weights: 3.668481
Average number of links: 35.73101

One thought is that maybe I don't need the dnearneigh function and can instead convert "int" into a dataframe and somehow merge or associate (perhaps with an inner join) the ID fields of the buffered and intersecting points and then compute the minimum value of "Conc" grouping by ID:

So in the above example I'd like to take the minimum of "Conc" among the col.id points grouped with row.id 1 (i.e., col.ids 1-18) and assign the  minimum value of this group as a new variable in data (Data$Conc_min), and do the same for row.id 2 and all the rest of the rows.

I'm just not sure how to do this and I appreciate any help folks might have on this matter!

Many thanks,
-Tiffany

Hi,

is there a function in the package rio to get the file extensions listed 
in the vignette under supported formats?

Thanks Sigbert

Hi Andrew/Petr,


Thanks for the replies.

In R Console if I run:

R.home("bin")

I get the following

"C:/PROGRA~1/R/R-42~1.2/bin/x64"

which is where

Rgui.exe is (within the x64 folder there are 13 files in total: 8 . exe 
and 5 .dll).


In file Explorer if I right-click on a .R file -> Open With -> R for 
Windows GUI Front-End

RGui (64-bit) opens but the .R file does not appear in the editor.


Amarjit

  Hi,


  My OS is Windows 11 Pro 64-Bit, I have R 4.2.2 and RStudio installed.

  If I double-click on a .R file in File Explorer the OS gives me the
  option of opening the .R in RStudio, or Look for an app in the 
Microsoft
  Store, or More Apps. Similarly with a right-click.

  I would like to associate a .R file with the RGui, not RStudio, thus
  when I double-click on a .R file in File Explorer the .R file opens in
  the R Editor in RGui.

  On my PC R 4.2.2 is located in "C:/Program Files/R/R-4.2.2/etc"

  Please can someone provide step-by-step instructions on how to
  associate?


  thanks,
  Amarjit

RGui is not an editor. It is a console (aka REPL, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop).

When using RGui, it is up to you to edit your R file in an external editor like Notepad++ and copy paste code snippets or use source("yourfile.R") as desired.

Subject: [R] Is this *always* the intended R^2 value for no intercept in lm?
Message-ID: <CALAJGyCDBnYiaEFfOOBtkvWgxaSb=+hE1beDk6AOBFaoLswYPw@mail.gmail.com>

I am puzzled by the computation of R^2 with intercept omitted that is
already illustrated by the following example taken from help("lm")

## Annette Dobson (1990) "An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models".
## Page 9: Plant Weight Data.
ctl <- c(4.17,5.58,5.18,6.11,4.50,4.61,5.17,4.53,5.33,5.14)
trt <- c(4.81,4.17,4.41,3.59,5.87,3.83,6.03,4.89,4.32,4.69)
group <- gl(2, 10, 20, labels = c("Ctl","Trt"))
weight <- c(ctl, trt)
lm.D9 <- lm(weight ~ group)
lm.D90 <- lm(weight ~ group - 1) # omitting intercept

The calculations for the R^2 for both models  are consistent with the
help("summary.lm") description:
"y* is the mean of y[i] if there is an intercept and zero otherwise."
Which causes a dramatic difference in the resulting R^2 values.

r2.D9 <- summary(lm.D9)$r.squared
r2.D90 <- summary(lm.D90)$r.squared

all.equal(r2.D9, 0.0730775989903856) #TRUE
all.equal(r2.D90, 0.981783272435264) #TRUE

This is counter-intuitive to say the least since the two models have
identical predictions and both models could be described more
accurately as two intercepts rather than zero. I see three
possibilities:

1. This is the intended result, in which case no fix is required, but
I?d be curious to understand the argument better.
2. This is an unfortunate outcome but not worth fixing as the user can
easily compute the correct R^2. In this case, I'd suggest that this
unintuitive behavior should be explicitly called out in the
documentation.
3. This is a bug worth fixing.

I look forward to hearing the community?s opinion on this.
Thanks in advance!

FAQ 7.41
and
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57415793/r-squared-in-lm-for-zero-intercept-model

(among numerous others that could no doubt be found with a bit of
searching).

In short, the "null models" against which you are comparing the fitted
model are different with and without an intercept.

You were told that RGui is not an editor.

Are you implying that your initial message contained an implicit request 
for instructions on how to get R code in an .R file to be opened 
automagically when double-clicked or to have "open in <some editor>" 
appear when right-clicked? (I didn't see that clearly expressed.)

If you want something else to happen with a file that has a .R extension 
when double-clicked or right-clicked in a GUI file manager, then you 
need to configure your OS to do whatever else it is that you expect. 
This is not really an R question. It's an OS question. There are many 
editors that can also bring up R consoles when the right? key combo is 
pressed. They do require some study for their specific actions, but this 
is not really the place to get guidance on the fine details.
