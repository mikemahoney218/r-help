Subject: [R] Need help testing a problem
Message-ID: <15EE349C-1593-481E-9A22-2014393B8DB9@noaa.gov>

HI All:

We are trying to figure out a problem that is occurring with a package,  and we need a non-NOAA person with a Windows computer with the latest R to test for us what is failing (but works on Macs and Linux from different sites).  Part of the problem is there is an Akamai service in between that we feel may be messing up things. To do this you would need to be willing to:

1.  install the ?rerddap? package from CRAN,  with all dependencies - or if installed make certain it is the latest

2. make certain that the packages ?curl?, ?crul? and ?http? are up to date.  

3.  Run the following:

# load rerddap
library("rerddap?)
# delete rerddap cache just in case
cache_delete_all()
# get the data extract
dat <- tabledap('FED_JSATS_detects', url = "https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/", 'study_id="RBDD_2018"', callopts = list(verbose = TRUE), store = memory())

4. If it works also do:

 head(dat)

Either way if all the output could be sent to me it would be very helpful.  The download may take a couple of minutes,
the file size is about 3.5MB.

If anyone has concerns about what is being downloaded you can check the ?rerddap? docs to see these are all legitimate ?rerddap' commands,  the datasets being accessed is https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/FED_JSATS_detects.html.  The downloaded file goes to R temp space, and its location,  if successful is given in the output.

Thanks to anyone willing to help.  One of my issues is I have been unable to reproduce the error,  but I also do not have ready access to a Windows machine.

Hello,

Tested with R 4.3.2 running on Windows 11.

1. You mention package http but there is no package http on CRAN, did 
you mean package httr?

2. I wrote a script rhelp.R, ran it on a command window and here is what 
I got on the command window output.

3. The file rhelp_out.txt was created and its contents are the 
following. (I installed package "hoardr" separately because for some 
reason it was not being recognized as a dependency)

So there was an unspecified error, an error without a condition message 
and no call expression. I find this stranger, a call like the following 
is expected.


tryCatch(stop("error"), error = function(e) e) |> str()
List of 2
  $ message: chr "error"
  $ call   : language doTryCatch(return(expr), name, parentenv, handler)
  - attr(*, "class")= chr [1:3] "simpleError" "error" "condition"


Function tabledap doesn't seem to be handling errors properly.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

HI Rui:

First and foremost thanks  for taking the time to do this.  That was a typo,  it was httr and is not needed,  I was careless.  That request works fine on a Mac and a Linux box.  We needed to check if there was something about  iour internal network settings, our Windows setup or something else that was causing the problem.  Bill Dunlop got the same results so it is something else,  We do not know how much Akamai is interfering with this,  we have had issues with folks running Windows behind Cloudfare that caused problems.

Again,  thanks for taking the time,  it eliminates on possible cause.

-Roy

I thought so too, but Google suggests there is at least one package on CRAN with this symbol in it.

OP:

a) You should always mention which contributed package you are using. Most references to this term online seem to be related to Python rather than R.

b) This seems like extremely specialized knowledge... even if it is a CRAN package this doesn't seem like the kind of R language topic normally discussed here. The CRAN package entry online may include a pointer to a more appropriate venue for getting help.

c) Also, we can only see the text portion of your email ... it is strongly recommended in the Posting Guide (linked in the message footer) to send your questions formatted as text rather than HTML to avoid "we don't see what you see" mis-communication. Sorry if that seems vague, but there are too many email programs out there for us to know how you should configure yours to do this... but it is practically always possible.

Subject: [R] gathering denominator under frac
Message-ID: <d20ae319-3a9f-4fc2-b5cf-7c0bb814fe68@gvdnet.dk>

Hi friends - I'm plotting a ratio of bicarbonates i ggplot2 and

ylab(expression(paste(frac("additive BIC","true BIC")))) worked OK - but 
now I have been asked to put the chemistry instead - so I wrote

 ?ylab(expression(paste(frac("additive",HCO[3]^"-","true",HCO[3]^"-")))) 
- and frac saw that as additive = numerator and HCO3- = denominator and 
the rest was ignored-

So how do I make frac ignore the first ","? and print the fraction as I 
want?


All best wishes
Troels

Hello,

This seems to work. Instead of separating the two numerator strings with 
a comma, separate them with a tilde. The same goes for the denominator.
And there is no need for double quotes around "additive" and "true".


library(ggplot2)

g <- ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
   geom_point()

g + ylab(expression(paste(frac(
   additive~HCO[3]^"-",
   true~HCO[3]^"-"
))))



Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

... or if I understand correctly, simply

expression(frac(additive ~ HCO[3]^"-",
                           true ~ HCO[3]^"-" )))

BTW, for your amusement,

ylab = ~ frac(additive ~ HCO[3]^"-",
                           true ~ HCO[3]^"-" ))

also should work. The reason is (from ?plotmath):

"In most cases other language objects (names and calls, including
formulas) are coerced to expressions and so can also be used."

Cheers,
Bert

I have done a scatter plot in R. I want to insert the coefficient of
determination R^2 = 0.62 as a text in the plot. I have tried to write R^2
but could not produce R2. I would appreciate it if someone could help me
with the syntax. I have tried:  expression(paste("", R^2,"=", 0.62)), but
it did not produce R squared, rather it gave me error messages. Thanks.

Thank you Zhao for the code. When I replotted the graph after inserting the
code in my script, it gave me this error message without plotting the graph:
Warning message:
In lm.fit(x, y, offset = offset, singular.ok = singular.ok, ...) :
 extra argument ?col? will be disregarded.

Hi,

maybe this works:

expression(R^2 * "= 0.62")

HTH,

Here is the script I used to plot the graph indicating the text I wanted to
insert. The line in the script that I have issues with is: text(-8,-8,
"R^2=  0.62",  r = 0.79, N = 161", cex = 2
R^2=  0.62 is not producing R squared = 0.62.
Thanks.

FDcli=dt$FDcli
FDapt=dt$FDapt

This works for me:

curve(dnorm, from=-3, to=3, main="Normal Distribution")
text(x=0, y=0.1, cex=1.5, expression(R^2 == 0.62))

if you are used to write expression using LaTeX math , then maybe you
like the latex2exp package:
curve(dnorm, from=-3, to=3, main="Normal Distribution")
text(0, 0.1, latex2exp::TeX("$R^2 = 0.62$"))

Martin
