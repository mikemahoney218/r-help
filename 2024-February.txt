Subject: [R] Need help testing a problem
Message-ID: <15EE349C-1593-481E-9A22-2014393B8DB9@noaa.gov>

HI All:

We are trying to figure out a problem that is occurring with a package,  and we need a non-NOAA person with a Windows computer with the latest R to test for us what is failing (but works on Macs and Linux from different sites).  Part of the problem is there is an Akamai service in between that we feel may be messing up things. To do this you would need to be willing to:

1.  install the ?rerddap? package from CRAN,  with all dependencies - or if installed make certain it is the latest

2. make certain that the packages ?curl?, ?crul? and ?http? are up to date.  

3.  Run the following:

# load rerddap
library("rerddap?)
# delete rerddap cache just in case
cache_delete_all()
# get the data extract
dat <- tabledap('FED_JSATS_detects', url = "https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/", 'study_id="RBDD_2018"', callopts = list(verbose = TRUE), store = memory())

4. If it works also do:

 head(dat)

Either way if all the output could be sent to me it would be very helpful.  The download may take a couple of minutes,
the file size is about 3.5MB.

If anyone has concerns about what is being downloaded you can check the ?rerddap? docs to see these are all legitimate ?rerddap' commands,  the datasets being accessed is https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/FED_JSATS_detects.html.  The downloaded file goes to R temp space, and its location,  if successful is given in the output.

Thanks to anyone willing to help.  One of my issues is I have been unable to reproduce the error,  but I also do not have ready access to a Windows machine.

Hello,

Tested with R 4.3.2 running on Windows 11.

1. You mention package http but there is no package http on CRAN, did 
you mean package httr?

2. I wrote a script rhelp.R, ran it on a command window and here is what 
I got on the command window output.

3. The file rhelp_out.txt was created and its contents are the 
following. (I installed package "hoardr" separately because for some 
reason it was not being recognized as a dependency)

So there was an unspecified error, an error without a condition message 
and no call expression. I find this stranger, a call like the following 
is expected.


tryCatch(stop("error"), error = function(e) e) |> str()
List of 2
  $ message: chr "error"
  $ call   : language doTryCatch(return(expr), name, parentenv, handler)
  - attr(*, "class")= chr [1:3] "simpleError" "error" "condition"


Function tabledap doesn't seem to be handling errors properly.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

HI Rui:

First and foremost thanks  for taking the time to do this.  That was a typo,  it was httr and is not needed,  I was careless.  That request works fine on a Mac and a Linux box.  We needed to check if there was something about  iour internal network settings, our Windows setup or something else that was causing the problem.  Bill Dunlop got the same results so it is something else,  We do not know how much Akamai is interfering with this,  we have had issues with folks running Windows behind Cloudfare that caused problems.

Again,  thanks for taking the time,  it eliminates on possible cause.

-Roy

I thought so too, but Google suggests there is at least one package on CRAN with this symbol in it.

OP:

a) You should always mention which contributed package you are using. Most references to this term online seem to be related to Python rather than R.

b) This seems like extremely specialized knowledge... even if it is a CRAN package this doesn't seem like the kind of R language topic normally discussed here. The CRAN package entry online may include a pointer to a more appropriate venue for getting help.

c) Also, we can only see the text portion of your email ... it is strongly recommended in the Posting Guide (linked in the message footer) to send your questions formatted as text rather than HTML to avoid "we don't see what you see" mis-communication. Sorry if that seems vague, but there are too many email programs out there for us to know how you should configure yours to do this... but it is practically always possible.

Subject: [R] gathering denominator under frac
Message-ID: <d20ae319-3a9f-4fc2-b5cf-7c0bb814fe68@gvdnet.dk>

Hi friends - I'm plotting a ratio of bicarbonates i ggplot2 and

ylab(expression(paste(frac("additive BIC","true BIC")))) worked OK - but 
now I have been asked to put the chemistry instead - so I wrote

 ?ylab(expression(paste(frac("additive",HCO[3]^"-","true",HCO[3]^"-")))) 
- and frac saw that as additive = numerator and HCO3- = denominator and 
the rest was ignored-

So how do I make frac ignore the first ","? and print the fraction as I 
want?


All best wishes
Troels

Hello,

This seems to work. Instead of separating the two numerator strings with 
a comma, separate them with a tilde. The same goes for the denominator.
And there is no need for double quotes around "additive" and "true".


library(ggplot2)

g <- ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
   geom_point()

g + ylab(expression(paste(frac(
   additive~HCO[3]^"-",
   true~HCO[3]^"-"
))))



Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

... or if I understand correctly, simply

expression(frac(additive ~ HCO[3]^"-",
                           true ~ HCO[3]^"-" )))

BTW, for your amusement,

ylab = ~ frac(additive ~ HCO[3]^"-",
                           true ~ HCO[3]^"-" ))

also should work. The reason is (from ?plotmath):

"In most cases other language objects (names and calls, including
formulas) are coerced to expressions and so can also be used."

Cheers,
Bert

I have done a scatter plot in R. I want to insert the coefficient of
determination R^2 = 0.62 as a text in the plot. I have tried to write R^2
but could not produce R2. I would appreciate it if someone could help me
with the syntax. I have tried:  expression(paste("", R^2,"=", 0.62)), but
it did not produce R squared, rather it gave me error messages. Thanks.

Thank you Zhao for the code. When I replotted the graph after inserting the
code in my script, it gave me this error message without plotting the graph:
Warning message:
In lm.fit(x, y, offset = offset, singular.ok = singular.ok, ...) :
 extra argument ?col? will be disregarded.

Hi,

maybe this works:

expression(R^2 * "= 0.62")

HTH,

Here is the script I used to plot the graph indicating the text I wanted to

"R^2=  0.62",  r = 0.79, N = 161", cex = 2
R^2=  0.62 is not producing R squared = 0.62.
Thanks.

FDcli=dt$FDcli
FDapt=dt$FDapt

This works for me:

curve(dnorm, from=-3, to=3, main="Normal Distribution")
text(x=0, y=0.1, cex=1.5, expression(R^2 == 0.62))

if you are used to write expression using LaTeX math , then maybe you
like the latex2exp package:
curve(dnorm, from=-3, to=3, main="Normal Distribution")
text(0, 0.1, latex2exp::TeX("$R^2 = 0.62$"))

Martin

Hi,

the command line with 'text' should be:

text(-8,-8, expression(R^2 * " = 0.62,  r = 0.79, N = 161"), cex = 2 )

Best,

Kimmo

Subject: [R] ggarrange & legend
Message-ID: <009201da581a$1ef2e600$5cd8b200$@gmx.ch>

Dear R community

It is possible to adjust the legend in combined ggplots using ggarrange with
be positions top, bottom, left and right.
My question: Is there a function to change the position of the legend to
topright or bottomleft? Right and top etc are in the middle of the axis.

Kind regards
Sibylle

Nothing got through.  Try plain text rather than HTML.

Dear John Kane

Dear R community

 

Here my working example

1.	Example that is working with legend=?top?. However, as mentioned, the legend is in the middle of the top axis. 

mylist<-list(p1, p2)

dev.new(width=28, height=18)

fig1<- ggarrange(plotlist=mylist, common.legend = TRUE, legend="top", labels = c("(A)", "(B)"), font.label = list(size = 18, color = "black"), ncol=2)

fig1

 

2.	My question is how I can position the legend on the topright of the top axis. However, ?topright? is not a common label for legend in ggarrange (but in other plot functions), so legend =?topright? is not working.

mylist<-list(p1, p2)

dev.new(width=28, height=18)

fig1<- ggarrange(plotlist=mylist, common.legend = TRUE, legend="topright", labels = c("(A)", "(B)"), font.label = list(size = 18, color = "black"), ncol=2)

fig1

 

Kind regards

Sibylle

I'm sorry but that is not a working example.

A working example needs to create the plots being used.

For example, stealing some code from
https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/reference/ggarrange.html
#=================================================================

data <https://rdrr.io/r/utils/data.html>("ToothGrowth")df <-
ToothGrowthdf$dose <- as.factor
<https://rdrr.io/r/base/factor.html>(df$dose)# Box plotbxp <-
ggboxplot <https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/reference/ggboxplot.html>(df,
x = "dose", y = "len",    color = "dose", palette = "jco")# Density
plotdens <- ggdensity
<https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/reference/ggdensity.html>(df, x =
"len", fill = "dose", palette = "jco")

mylist<-list(bxp, dens)

dev.new(width=28, height=18)

fig1<- ggarrange(plotlist=mylist, common.legend = TRUE, legend="top",
labels = c("(A)", "(B)"), font.label = list(size = 18, color =
"black"), ncol=2)

fig1

Would something like this help?
library(ggplot2)

# Create a plot
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot", x = "Weight", y = "Miles Per Gallon")

# Add text at a specific location
p + annotate("text", x = min(mtcars$wt) + 23, y = max(mtcars$mpg) - 10, label = "Custom Text")

Hi

Using John's example ...


data("ToothGrowth")
df <-ToothGrowth
df$dose <- as.factor(df$dose)
## Box plot
bxp <- ggboxplot(df, x = "dose", y = "len",
	         color = "dose", palette = "jco")
## Density plot
dens <- ggdensity(df, x = "len", fill = "dose", palette = "jco")
mylist<-list(bxp, dens)
dev.new(width=28, height=18)
fig1<- ggarrange(plotlist=mylist, common.legend = TRUE,
                  legend="top",
                  labels = c("(A)", "(B)"),
                  font.label = list(size = 18, color = "black"), ncol=2)
fig1


... the problem is that even though 'ggplot2' allows a numeric 'legend'
(although this result is probably not what you want anyway) ...


bxp + theme(legend.position=c(1, 1))


... ggpubr::ggarrange() passes the 'legend' on to ggpubr:::.plot_grid(),
which does an explicit switch(legend), which fails ...


try(ggarrange(plotlist=mylist, common.legend = TRUE,
               legend=c(1, 1),
               labels = c("(A)", "(B)"),
               font.label = list(size = 18, color = "black"), ncol=2))


One option is to extract the legend
('position' will affect orientation of legend?) ...


legend <- ggpubr::get_legend(bxp, position="top")


... and then draw the legend yourself (in the top-right corner)
and tell ggarange() NOT to draw the legend ...


library(grid)
h <- sum(legend$height)
w <- sum(legend$width)
combined <- ggarrange(plotlist=mylist, common.legend = TRUE,
                       legend="none",
                       labels = c("(A)", "(B)"),
                       font.label = list(size = 18, color = "black"),
                       ncol=2)
grid.newpage()
pushViewport(viewport(y=1, height=h,
                       x=1, width=w,
                       just=c("right", "top")))
grid.draw(legend)
popViewport()
pushViewport(viewport(y=0, height=unit(1, "npc") - h, just="bottom"))
print(combined, newpage=FALSE)
popViewport()


Is that what you were looking for?

Subject: [R] Is simplify2array working for dimension > 2?
Message-ID: <CANufCk64bQiuD+rSf+_1kxeOHjfhfdcayseGsacf7MVSt8QLkg@mail.gmail.com>

Reading the doc for ?simplify2array, I got the impression that with the
'higher = T' argument the function returns an array of dimension greater
than 2 when it makes sense (the doc says "when appropriate", which is
rather vague). I would expect

a <- list(
  list(list(1, 2), list(3, 4)),
  list(list(5, 6), list(7, 8))
)
simplify2array(a, higher = T)

to return the same (possibly up to a dimension permutation) as
array(1:8, dim = c(2, 2, 2))

However, in this case simplify2array returns a matrix (i.e. 2 dimensional
array), whose elements are lists.
It's the same as
structure(list(list(1, 2), list(3, 4), list(5, 6), list(7, 8)), dim = c(2,
2))

I get the same behavior with
a <- list(
  list(c(1, 2), c(3, 4)),
  list(c(5, 6), c(7, 8))
)
but then the matrix elements are numeric vectors instead of lists.

Did I miss something to get the result I expected with this function? Or is
it a bug? Or maybe the function is not supposed to return a higher
dimensional array, and I didn't understand the documentation correctly?

There is a workaround, one can do for instance
array(unlist(a), dim = c(2, 2, 2))
and there may be better options (checking dimensions?).

In case it's important: running R 4.3.2 on Debian 12.4.

Best regards,

Jean-Claude Arbaut

Jean-Claude:

Well, here's my "explanation". Caveat emptor!

Note that:
"simplify2array() is the utility called from sapply() when simplify is
not false"

and

> sapply(a, I, simplify = "array")
     [,1]   [,2]
[1,] list,2 list,2
[2,] list,2 list,2

So it seems that simplify2array() is not intended to operate in the
way that you expected, i.e. that recursive simplification is done.
And, indeed, if you check the code for the function, you will see that
that is the case. Perhaps the key phrase in the docs is in the
sapply() part that says:

"sapply is a user-friendly version and wrapper of lapply by default
returning a vector, matrix or, if simplify = "array", an array ***if
appropriate***, by applying simplify2array(). "   In other words,
recursive simplification is considered not "appropriate".

FWIW I also find this somewhat confusing and think that explicitly
saying that recursive simplification is not done might make it less
so. But writing docs that  address all our possible misconceptions is
pretty difficult (or impossible!), and maybe adding that explicit
caveat would confuse others even more... :-(

Cheers,
Bert
