Subject: [R] Need help testing a problem
Message-ID: <15EE349C-1593-481E-9A22-2014393B8DB9@noaa.gov>

HI All:

We are trying to figure out a problem that is occurring with a package,  and we need a non-NOAA person with a Windows computer with the latest R to test for us what is failing (but works on Macs and Linux from different sites).  Part of the problem is there is an Akamai service in between that we feel may be messing up things. To do this you would need to be willing to:

1.  install the ?rerddap? package from CRAN,  with all dependencies - or if installed make certain it is the latest

2. make certain that the packages ?curl?, ?crul? and ?http? are up to date.  

3.  Run the following:

# load rerddap
library("rerddap?)
# delete rerddap cache just in case
cache_delete_all()
# get the data extract
dat <- tabledap('FED_JSATS_detects', url = "https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/", 'study_id="RBDD_2018"', callopts = list(verbose = TRUE), store = memory())

4. If it works also do:

 head(dat)

Either way if all the output could be sent to me it would be very helpful.  The download may take a couple of minutes,
the file size is about 3.5MB.

If anyone has concerns about what is being downloaded you can check the ?rerddap? docs to see these are all legitimate ?rerddap' commands,  the datasets being accessed is https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/FED_JSATS_detects.html.  The downloaded file goes to R temp space, and its location,  if successful is given in the output.

Thanks to anyone willing to help.  One of my issues is I have been unable to reproduce the error,  but I also do not have ready access to a Windows machine.

Hello,

Tested with R 4.3.2 running on Windows 11.

1. You mention package http but there is no package http on CRAN, did 
you mean package httr?

2. I wrote a script rhelp.R, ran it on a command window and here is what 
I got on the command window output.

3. The file rhelp_out.txt was created and its contents are the 
following. (I installed package "hoardr" separately because for some 
reason it was not being recognized as a dependency)

So there was an unspecified error, an error without a condition message 
and no call expression. I find this stranger, a call like the following 
is expected.


tryCatch(stop("error"), error = function(e) e) |> str()
List of 2
  $ message: chr "error"
  $ call   : language doTryCatch(return(expr), name, parentenv, handler)
  - attr(*, "class")= chr [1:3] "simpleError" "error" "condition"


Function tabledap doesn't seem to be handling errors properly.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

HI Rui:

First and foremost thanks  for taking the time to do this.  That was a typo,  it was httr and is not needed,  I was careless.  That request works fine on a Mac and a Linux box.  We needed to check if there was something about  iour internal network settings, our Windows setup or something else that was causing the problem.  Bill Dunlop got the same results so it is something else,  We do not know how much Akamai is interfering with this,  we have had issues with folks running Windows behind Cloudfare that caused problems.

Again,  thanks for taking the time,  it eliminates on possible cause.

-Roy

I thought so too, but Google suggests there is at least one package on CRAN with this symbol in it.

OP:

a) You should always mention which contributed package you are using. Most references to this term online seem to be related to Python rather than R.

b) This seems like extremely specialized knowledge... even if it is a CRAN package this doesn't seem like the kind of R language topic normally discussed here. The CRAN package entry online may include a pointer to a more appropriate venue for getting help.

c) Also, we can only see the text portion of your email ... it is strongly recommended in the Posting Guide (linked in the message footer) to send your questions formatted as text rather than HTML to avoid "we don't see what you see" mis-communication. Sorry if that seems vague, but there are too many email programs out there for us to know how you should configure yours to do this... but it is practically always possible.

Subject: [R] gathering denominator under frac
Message-ID: <d20ae319-3a9f-4fc2-b5cf-7c0bb814fe68@gvdnet.dk>

Hi friends - I'm plotting a ratio of bicarbonates i ggplot2 and

ylab(expression(paste(frac("additive BIC","true BIC")))) worked OK - but 
now I have been asked to put the chemistry instead - so I wrote

 ?ylab(expression(paste(frac("additive",HCO[3]^"-","true",HCO[3]^"-")))) 
- and frac saw that as additive = numerator and HCO3- = denominator and 
the rest was ignored-

So how do I make frac ignore the first ","? and print the fraction as I 
want?


All best wishes
Troels

Hello,

This seems to work. Instead of separating the two numerator strings with 
a comma, separate them with a tilde. The same goes for the denominator.
And there is no need for double quotes around "additive" and "true".


library(ggplot2)

g <- ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
   geom_point()

g + ylab(expression(paste(frac(
   additive~HCO[3]^"-",
   true~HCO[3]^"-"
))))



Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

... or if I understand correctly, simply

expression(frac(additive ~ HCO[3]^"-",
                           true ~ HCO[3]^"-" )))

BTW, for your amusement,

ylab = ~ frac(additive ~ HCO[3]^"-",
                           true ~ HCO[3]^"-" ))

also should work. The reason is (from ?plotmath):

"In most cases other language objects (names and calls, including
formulas) are coerced to expressions and so can also be used."

Cheers,
Bert

I have done a scatter plot in R. I want to insert the coefficient of
determination R^2 = 0.62 as a text in the plot. I have tried to write R^2
but could not produce R2. I would appreciate it if someone could help me
with the syntax. I have tried:  expression(paste("", R^2,"=", 0.62)), but
it did not produce R squared, rather it gave me error messages. Thanks.

Thank you Zhao for the code. When I replotted the graph after inserting the
code in my script, it gave me this error message without plotting the graph:
Warning message:
In lm.fit(x, y, offset = offset, singular.ok = singular.ok, ...) :
 extra argument ?col? will be disregarded.

Hi,

maybe this works:

expression(R^2 * "= 0.62")

HTH,

Here is the script I used to plot the graph indicating the text I wanted to

"R^2=  0.62",  r = 0.79, N = 161", cex = 2
R^2=  0.62 is not producing R squared = 0.62.
Thanks.

FDcli=dt$FDcli
FDapt=dt$FDapt

This works for me:

curve(dnorm, from=-3, to=3, main="Normal Distribution")
text(x=0, y=0.1, cex=1.5, expression(R^2 == 0.62))

if you are used to write expression using LaTeX math , then maybe you
like the latex2exp package:
curve(dnorm, from=-3, to=3, main="Normal Distribution")
text(0, 0.1, latex2exp::TeX("$R^2 = 0.62$"))

Martin

Hi,

the command line with 'text' should be:

text(-8,-8, expression(R^2 * " = 0.62,  r = 0.79, N = 161"), cex = 2 )

Best,

Kimmo

Subject: [R] ggarrange & legend
Message-ID: <009201da581a$1ef2e600$5cd8b200$@gmx.ch>

Dear R community

It is possible to adjust the legend in combined ggplots using ggarrange with
be positions top, bottom, left and right.
My question: Is there a function to change the position of the legend to
topright or bottomleft? Right and top etc are in the middle of the axis.

Kind regards
Sibylle

Nothing got through.  Try plain text rather than HTML.

Dear John Kane

Dear R community

 

Here my working example

1.	Example that is working with legend=?top?. However, as mentioned, the legend is in the middle of the top axis. 

mylist<-list(p1, p2)

dev.new(width=28, height=18)

fig1<- ggarrange(plotlist=mylist, common.legend = TRUE, legend="top", labels = c("(A)", "(B)"), font.label = list(size = 18, color = "black"), ncol=2)

fig1

 

2.	My question is how I can position the legend on the topright of the top axis. However, ?topright? is not a common label for legend in ggarrange (but in other plot functions), so legend =?topright? is not working.

mylist<-list(p1, p2)

dev.new(width=28, height=18)

fig1<- ggarrange(plotlist=mylist, common.legend = TRUE, legend="topright", labels = c("(A)", "(B)"), font.label = list(size = 18, color = "black"), ncol=2)

fig1

 

Kind regards

Sibylle

I'm sorry but that is not a working example.

A working example needs to create the plots being used.

For example, stealing some code from
https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/reference/ggarrange.html
#=================================================================

data <https://rdrr.io/r/utils/data.html>("ToothGrowth")df <-
ToothGrowthdf$dose <- as.factor
<https://rdrr.io/r/base/factor.html>(df$dose)# Box plotbxp <-
ggboxplot <https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/reference/ggboxplot.html>(df,
x = "dose", y = "len",    color = "dose", palette = "jco")# Density
plotdens <- ggdensity
<https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/reference/ggdensity.html>(df, x =
"len", fill = "dose", palette = "jco")

mylist<-list(bxp, dens)

dev.new(width=28, height=18)

fig1<- ggarrange(plotlist=mylist, common.legend = TRUE, legend="top",
labels = c("(A)", "(B)"), font.label = list(size = 18, color =
"black"), ncol=2)

fig1

Would something like this help?
library(ggplot2)

# Create a plot
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot", x = "Weight", y = "Miles Per Gallon")

# Add text at a specific location
p + annotate("text", x = min(mtcars$wt) + 23, y = max(mtcars$mpg) - 10, label = "Custom Text")

Hi

Using John's example ...


data("ToothGrowth")
df <-ToothGrowth
df$dose <- as.factor(df$dose)
## Box plot
bxp <- ggboxplot(df, x = "dose", y = "len",
	         color = "dose", palette = "jco")
## Density plot
dens <- ggdensity(df, x = "len", fill = "dose", palette = "jco")
mylist<-list(bxp, dens)
dev.new(width=28, height=18)
fig1<- ggarrange(plotlist=mylist, common.legend = TRUE,
                  legend="top",
                  labels = c("(A)", "(B)"),
                  font.label = list(size = 18, color = "black"), ncol=2)
fig1


... the problem is that even though 'ggplot2' allows a numeric 'legend'
(although this result is probably not what you want anyway) ...


bxp + theme(legend.position=c(1, 1))


... ggpubr::ggarrange() passes the 'legend' on to ggpubr:::.plot_grid(),
which does an explicit switch(legend), which fails ...


try(ggarrange(plotlist=mylist, common.legend = TRUE,
               legend=c(1, 1),
               labels = c("(A)", "(B)"),
               font.label = list(size = 18, color = "black"), ncol=2))


One option is to extract the legend
('position' will affect orientation of legend?) ...


legend <- ggpubr::get_legend(bxp, position="top")


... and then draw the legend yourself (in the top-right corner)
and tell ggarange() NOT to draw the legend ...


library(grid)
h <- sum(legend$height)
w <- sum(legend$width)
combined <- ggarrange(plotlist=mylist, common.legend = TRUE,
                       legend="none",
                       labels = c("(A)", "(B)"),
                       font.label = list(size = 18, color = "black"),
                       ncol=2)
grid.newpage()
pushViewport(viewport(y=1, height=h,
                       x=1, width=w,
                       just=c("right", "top")))
grid.draw(legend)
popViewport()
pushViewport(viewport(y=0, height=unit(1, "npc") - h, just="bottom"))
print(combined, newpage=FALSE)
popViewport()


Is that what you were looking for?

Subject: [R] Is simplify2array working for dimension > 2?
Message-ID: <CANufCk64bQiuD+rSf+_1kxeOHjfhfdcayseGsacf7MVSt8QLkg@mail.gmail.com>

Reading the doc for ?simplify2array, I got the impression that with the
'higher = T' argument the function returns an array of dimension greater
than 2 when it makes sense (the doc says "when appropriate", which is
rather vague). I would expect

a <- list(
  list(list(1, 2), list(3, 4)),
  list(list(5, 6), list(7, 8))
)
simplify2array(a, higher = T)

to return the same (possibly up to a dimension permutation) as
array(1:8, dim = c(2, 2, 2))

However, in this case simplify2array returns a matrix (i.e. 2 dimensional
array), whose elements are lists.
It's the same as
structure(list(list(1, 2), list(3, 4), list(5, 6), list(7, 8)), dim = c(2,
2))

I get the same behavior with
a <- list(
  list(c(1, 2), c(3, 4)),
  list(c(5, 6), c(7, 8))
)
but then the matrix elements are numeric vectors instead of lists.

Did I miss something to get the result I expected with this function? Or is
it a bug? Or maybe the function is not supposed to return a higher
dimensional array, and I didn't understand the documentation correctly?

There is a workaround, one can do for instance
array(unlist(a), dim = c(2, 2, 2))
and there may be better options (checking dimensions?).

In case it's important: running R 4.3.2 on Debian 12.4.

Best regards,

Jean-Claude Arbaut

Jean-Claude:

Well, here's my "explanation". Caveat emptor!

Note that:
"simplify2array() is the utility called from sapply() when simplify is
not false"

and

> sapply(a, I, simplify = "array")
     [,1]   [,2]
[1,] list,2 list,2
[2,] list,2 list,2

So it seems that simplify2array() is not intended to operate in the
way that you expected, i.e. that recursive simplification is done.
And, indeed, if you check the code for the function, you will see that
that is the case. Perhaps the key phrase in the docs is in the
sapply() part that says:

"sapply is a user-friendly version and wrapper of lapply by default
returning a vector, matrix or, if simplify = "array", an array ***if
appropriate***, by applying simplify2array(). "   In other words,
recursive simplification is considered not "appropriate".

FWIW I also find this somewhat confusing and think that explicitly
saying that recursive simplification is not done might make it less
so. But writing docs that  address all our possible misconceptions is
pretty difficult (or impossible!), and maybe adding that explicit
caveat would confuse others even more... :-(

Cheers,
Bert

Subject: [R] Avoiding Delete key function as 'Quit R' in Rterm when there
 are no characters in cursor line
Message-ID: <AM6PR02MB44232D0185AEEA5CAFB6CAE4944B2@AM6PR02MB4423.eurprd02.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all,

I cite from README.Rterm

^D, DEL?????: Delete the character under the cursor.

That is the general behaviour, but when there is no character (neither under the cursor nor at its left), pressing the Delete key suggests closing the R terminal. Is there any (configurable) way to avoid this behaviour?

Thanks!

Best regards,
Iago

Re your mention in your other mail (which didn't go to r-help) of this part
of the doc:

"The default value, TRUE, returns a vector or matrix if appropriate,
whereas if simplify = "array" the result may be an array of ?rank?
(==length(dim(.))) **one higher than the result of FUN(X[[i]]).**"

It's not I understood this, but it makes some sense:

sapply(1:2, function(i) diag(3)) is a matrix, but
sapply(1:2, function(i) diag(3), simplify = "array") is a rank-3 array.

So this is the "appropriate case", and recursively simplifying nested list
to high rank arrays is not something that's supposed to be done.

And indeed, simplify2array(list(diag(2), diag(2))) does yield a rank-3
array as well. And it works for a list of rank-3 arrays, converted to
rank-4, etc.

So list of array is ok, list of list is not, except for rank 2. The
behavior for rank 2 led me to think it applied as well for higher rank, and
the doc for the 'higher' argument seemed to confirm this, but I was a bit
optimistic.

Thanks for your answer. I believe the doc may be improved a little bit, but
the intent looks clearer now.

Are you talking about rterm in Windows, or which front end?

That looks to me like a bug, but I don't use Windows any more, so I 
won't offer to try to fix it for you.  In fact I don't think Rterm has 
many users at all:  most Windows users probably use RStudio or one of 
the other graphical front ends (Visual Studio, Emacs, Rgui, etc.)

So maybe you can track down the issue, or someone else will try.  Or 
maybe you'll just have to avoid triggering the bug (if it really is one).

I don't use term, but I've just tested it and this is reproducable.

Is it a bug? Not sure. If you hit c after getting the message it will
cancel the q() request.

Duncan, do you think it's worth to comment this in R-devel list?

I don't use term, but I've just tested it and this is reproducable.

Is it a bug? Not sure. If you hit c after getting the message it will cancel the q() request.

So maybe you can track down the issue, or someone else will try.  Or
maybe you'll just have to avoid triggering the bug (if it really is one).

Duncan filed a bug report via R bugzilla (thanks).

There is no way to disable this functionality and it has existed for 
very long time, I tested that at least in R 3.0. Optionally ending the 
session was I believe intentional with Ctrl+D, when the input is empty, 
and it is also how Unix terminals work. But ending the session with DEL 
was probably an implementation compromise and I've changed that in 
R-devel. Thanks for the report.

Hey everyone,
?
this question is related to this (https://community.rstudio.com/t/packages-are-not-updating/166214/3), this (https://www.biostars.org/p/9586316/#9586323) and this (https://support.bioconductor.org/p/9156283/#9156308). The two latter ones are pots from myself.
?
To sum it up: If I am updating packages (be it via Bioconductor or CRAN) some packages simply don?t update, but they also don?t throw any warning or error that they have not been updated. The reason behind this is most likely that there is an update, but it?s not yet available as a binary ? in my case as a "mac.binary.big-sur-arm64", since I am on Apple Silicon. My pkgType is set to "both" (default), but my .Platform$pkgType is "mac.binary.big-sur-arm64" (also default).
?
If the system shows an update is available and I click update (or update via install.packages()), but the package will not be updated, I would expect any kind of message that the package will not be updated, since no newer binary is available or a prompt, if I want to compile from source. However, the only message I get is:
```
trying URL '<url_to_package>'
Content type 'application/x-gzip' length XXXXXXX bytes (X.X MB)
==================================================
downloaded X.X MB
?
?
The downloaded binary packages are in
??????????????? /var/folders/ws/XXX/T//YYY/downloaded_packages
```
To see, if the package was actually updated, I have to check for updates again (or check the version of the installed package). Is this the expected behavior and if so, why? (Also, why is there a double slash in the path to the downloaded packages?)
?
Thanks for your help.
?
Best,
Philipp

Those three references are about RStudio and Bioconductor (or at least 
they start out that way, I didn't read through the long threads). 
Neither of those is relevant here, but from my quick scan it appears the 
issue is that those systems detect a package in source form is 
available, then install an older binary instead.

If you have an example where update.packages() does this, that would be 
on topic on this list.  Please post just that here:  your calls, and all 
the output you received.  In my experience update.packages() asks 
whether you want the source or binary install and respects your choice.

Yes you're right that it started as an Bioconductor issue. The reason I am writing it here, if because of one of the core members of the Bioconductor project stated this:
"(...) But anyway, it's almost certainly an install.packages issue rather than BiocManager::install, so you might check over at r-help at r-project.org."
?
It's hard to give an explicit example here since it's always a bit time dependent, when and if this happens. And "unfortunately", right now all packages can be updated, but I'll come back to this as soon as I experience it again. It's more of a general feature request then a help request, but as you say "In my experience update.packages() asks whether you want the source or binary install and respects your choice." However, at least for me, it does not do this anymore, but simply silently fails to update those packages.
?
The Bioconductor thread is the most informative for this (https://support.bioconductor.org/p/9156283[https://support.bioconductor.org/p/9156283/#9156308]) in case anyone wants to check the situation in more detail.

Hello,

Not exactly an answer, just a thought:
Whenever I have problems updating or installing packages from whithin 
RStudio I close RStudio, write a script with the install.packages() call 
and run it from a command window.


R -q -f "instscript.R"


This many times works better and it also works with Bioconductor's 
BiocManager::install or with remotes'/devtools's install_github.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

I think you should ask more from the BioC folks, or do more digging 
yourself.  At a minimum we would need to know what arguments were used 
in the call that failed before we could help you with this.  So if this 
ever happens again, here's what you can do:

  Run debug(install.packages), then the call to BiocManager::install. 
It will break to the debugger when install.packages is called.  It will 
print the whole source of install.packages which is quite long, but at 
the very top it will show something like

   debugging in: install.packages(pkgs = x)

The "install.packages(pkgs = x)" will be the call from whatever function 
calls install.packages.  The arguments shown may be constants or 
variables like x; the argument names may or may not be shown, depending 
on the Bioconductor code.  If they are variables, they are in the scope 
of the caller, not install.packages, whereas the argument name "pkgs" 
would be in scope and you could print it.  Record all the arguments that 
were passed, then quit using Q.

Now run undebug(install.packages), and re-run the install.packages() 
call from the command line, substituting the variables you recorded.  If 
that shows the same problems as when called from BiocManager::install, 
show us the log of what happened.  If not, it's a Bioconductor issue.

Subject: [R] Skip jumps in curve
Message-ID: <AM5P192MB00825BB890639BC5C560F5FC844F2@AM5P192MB0082.EURP192.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear R-Users,

Is there a way to skip over without plotting the jumps/discontinuities in curve()?

I have not seen such an option, but maybe I am missing something.

plot.gamma = function(xlim = c(-6, -1), ylim = c(-1,3), hline = NULL, n = 1000) {
   curve(gamma(x), from = xlim[1], to = xlim[2], ylim=ylim, n=n);
   if( ! is.null(hline)) abline(h = hline, col = "green");
}

Euler = 0.57721566490153286060651209008240243079;
plot.gamma(hline = Euler)

Adding an option to the function curve may be useful:
options = c("warn", "silent", "unconnected")

This is part of some experiments in math; but that's another topic. For latest version:
https://github.com/discoleo/R/blob/master/Math/Integrals.Gamma.Inv.R

Sincerely,

Leonard

If you know where the discontinuities are, plot multiple times with the 
discontinuities as endpoints:

plot.gamma = function(xlim = c(-6, -1), ylim = c(-1,3), hline = NULL, n 
= 1000) {
   start <- floor(xlim[1]):floor(xlim[2])
   end <- start + 1

   start[1] <- xlim[1]
   end[length(end)] <- xlim[2]

   n <- round(n/length(start))

   curve(gamma(x), from = start[1], to = end[1], ylim=ylim, n=n, xlim = 
xlim)
   for (i in seq_along(start)[-1])
     curve(gamma(x), from = start[i], to = end[i], add = TRUE, n)
   if( ! is.null(hline)) abline(h = hline, col = "green");
}

Euler = 0.57721566490153286060651209008240243079;
plot.gamma(hline = Euler)

If you don't know where the discontinuities are, it would be much 
harder, because discontinuities can be hard to detect unless the jumps 
are really big.

Dear Duncan,

Thank you very much for the response. I suspected that such an option has not been implemented yet.

The plot was very cluttered due to those vertical lines. Fortunately, the gamma function is easy to handle. But the feature remains on my wishlist as useful more in general.

Sincerely,

Leonard

It should be pretty easy to generalize my version of the `plot.gamma()` 
function to a version of `curve()` with an extra `discontinuities` argument.

Here is the skeleton of a function that lets you supply a function that
will be applied to diff(y) to say if this next point should be connected by
a line to the previous point.

p <- function (x, y = NULL, dy = diff(y), predicate = function(dy)
abs(dy)>2, ...,
  xlab = if (!missing(x)) deparse1(substitute(x)),
  ylab = if (!missing(y)) deparse1(substitute(y)), log = "", type="l")
{
  force(xlab)
  force(ylab)
  xy <- xy.coords(x, y, xlab, ylab, log)
  x <- xy$x
  y <- xy$y
  group <- cumsum( c(TRUE, !is.finite(dy) | predicate(dy)))
  plot(x, y, xlab=xy$xlab, ylab=xy$ylab, log=log, ..., type="n")
  sx <- split(x, group)
  sy <- split(y, group)
  lapply(seq_len(max(group)), function(i)points(type=type, sx[[i]],
sy[[i]]))
  invisible()
}


E.g., plot the tangent function where we know that the discontinuities are
where diff(y) is negative:

par(mfrow=c(2,1))
plot(tan(seq(0,10,by=1/4)), type="b")
p(tan(seq(0,10,by=1/4)), predicate = function(dy)dy<0, type="b")

Subject: [R] Optimal use of optim?
Message-ID: <VI1P192MB0095CC74932B18D9846F8603844E2@VI1P192MB0095.EURP192.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear R-Users,

I am interested in the optimal strategy for optim:

Q: How to formulate the optimization problem?
Q1: Are there benefits for abs(f(x)) vs (f(x))^2?
Q2: Are there any limitations for using abs(...)?

Regarding point 1: my feeling is that the gradients should be more robust with the abs(...) method; but I did not test it.

Regarding point 2: Obviously, abs(f(x)) is not differentiable. This is a limitation from a mathematical point of view, but the gradient should be still computable using a finite difference method. Are there any other limitations?

The question is based on the following example:
solving gamma(x) = y for some given y.

Function multiroot in package rootSolve fails when y < 1. The version using optim fares much better. However, I had to tweak somewhat the parameters in order to get a higher precision. This made me curious about the optimal strategy; unfortunately, I do not have much experience with optimizations.

The example is also available on GitHub:
https://github.com/discoleo/R/blob/master/Math/Integrals.Gamma.Inv.R

Sincerely,

Leonard

### Example:
gamma.invN = function(x, x0, lim, ...,
????????????ndeps = 1E-5, rtol = 1E-9, gtol = 0.0001, digits = 10) {
??????v = x;
??????if(length(lim) == 1) lim = c(lim - 1 + gtol, lim - gtol);
??????cntr = c(list(...), ndeps = ndeps, pgtol = rtol);
??????# abs(): should provide greater precision than ()^2 when computing the gradients;
??????# param ndeps: needed to improve accuracy;
??????r = optim(x0, \(x) { abs(gamma(x) - v); }, lower = lim[1], upper =lim[2],
????????????method = "L-BFGS-B", control = cntr);
??????if( ! is.null(digits)) print(r$par, digits);
??????return(r$par);
}

### Example
Euler   = 0.57721566490153286060651209008240243079;
x = gamma.invN(Euler, -3.5, lim = -3)
gamma(x) - Euler
x = gamma.invN(Euler, -3.9, lim = -3)
gamma(x) - Euler

This won't answer the questions, but will point out that I wrote the Nelder-Mead,
BFGS (I call it Variable Metric) and CG methods in BASIC in 1974. They were re-coded
many times and then incorporated in R around 1995 as I recall (Brian Ripley did the
incorporation). There are some great 50 year old cars, but ....

Might want to look at some of the more recent evolutions of the codes (all in R)
in optimx. Note that not all the optimx methods are "good". Many are present to
allow for comparison. Rvmmin and Rcgmin have proved quite reliable; if rarely
the winners in all cases, they tend to come in close to the front. Both do, however,
need gradients. Note that derivative of abs(x) can be defined as 0 at x=0 (even
if that offends purists). If you must use numerical derivatives, avoid forward or
backward approximations in favour of central or better ones.

RStudio is doing its own thing for some task, including
'install.packages()' (and for some reasons, at least on the platforms
on which I use RStudio, RStudio calls 'install.packages()' and not
'update.packages()' when an update is requested via the GUI). See:

RStudio> install.packages
function (...) 
.rs.callAs(name, hook, original, ...)
<environment: 0x55bab9293998>

compared to:

R> install.packages
function (pkgs, lib, repos = getOption("repos"), contriburl =
    contrib.url(repos, type), method, available = NULL, destdir = NULL,
    dependencies = NA, type = getOption("pkgType"), configure.args =
    getOption("configure.args"), configure.vars =
    getOption("configure.vars"), clean = FALSE, Ncpus =
    getOption("Ncpus", 1L), verbose = getOption("verbose"), libs_only =
    FALSE, INSTALL_opts, quiet = FALSE, keep_outputs = FALSE, ...) 
{
[...]

So if you use Install/Update in the Packages tab of RStudio and do not
experience the behaviour you are expecting, it is something that you
need to discuss with Posit, not with R. :)

The package name has the version number encoded in it, so theoretical
you should be able to tell at this point whether the package that is
downloaded is the version that is already installed, hence no update
will happen.

Yes, thank's a lot, Berwin.

Indeed I've raised the fact that RStudio
hides R's own install.packages() from the user  and uses its
own, undocumented one ... this has been the case for quite a few years.
I found out during teaching --- one of the few times, I use
RStudio to use R... in another case where RStudio's
install.packages() behaved differently than R's.

I'm pretty sure this is reason for quite a bit of confusion...

Hello,

 From within RStudio you can always run the qualified names

utils::install.packages()
utils::update.packages()

or run from the command line.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

What Martin says...

Also, it might help to know that the original, base-R functions are still there, as

utils::install.packages()
utils::update.packages()

(+ most likely, a restart of RStudio to make it adapt to the packages that you installed behind its back.)

Did they ignore your bug report?

To Whom It May Concern,
My name is Zach Benner and I am the Accessibility (A.D.A.-Americans with
Disabilities Act) Coordinator here at University of Maine at Machias.  I am
reaching out on the behalf of our science professors here at UMM. The
professor is looking to utilize your software to implement within his
courses however, due to possible accessibility concerns our IT department
will not download the software onto school computers unless we have a copy
of a VPAT or Accessibility Conformance Information Report. I was wondering
if I could obtain this information to provide to the IT department?
Thank you for your time on this matter and I look forward to hearing from
you soon. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
Sincerely,

Dear Zachary,

People will rightly point you to:

this article: https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2013-1/godfrey.pdf

and this book chapter: https://r-resources.massey.ac.nz/BrailleRInAction/WorkingBlind.html

There is additional information elsewhere, for example here:

https://www.google.com/search?q=using+r+as+a+blind+person&oq=using+r+as+a+blind+person

though people with visual difficulties may not be your only concern.

"VPAT or Accessibility Conformance Information Report? is rather insider-ish and evidently American; you?re kind-of on your own there. R is not our software; it?s free open-source software.

The normal way to update packages is to use update.packages() rather 
than install.packages().  Likely the problem you're having is from using 
install.packages() (or RStudio using it). I normally use 
update.packages(ask=FALSE), but if you want to pick and choose, you 
could use the default which will prompt you for each one.

Hey everyone,

Thanks for all the input. It's happening again. This time for the packages "DBI", "parallelly", "segmented", "survival", "V8". So, RStudio shows updates for those and updating them via RStudio leads to this output:
```

The downloaded binary packages are in
/var/folders/ws/XXX/T//YYY/downloaded_packages
```

After that, all the packages are still updatable. No warning, no error, but also no updated packages. utils::install.packages(c("DBI", "parallelly", "segmented", "survival", "V8")) leads to the exact same output. The only difference, if I run it directly from command-line is, that I have to select a mirror. After that it's again the same output. The DBI package for example is installed with version 1.2.0, which is the latest available macOS arm64 binary. However, there is an update available for other binaries or source. So, I guess in the end, it's not the install.packages() that is failing, but the check for updates from RStudio. On the other hand, shouldn't there be at least a warning that there are new updates available, just no new binaries.

Best,
Philipp

Perhaps, as Duncan suggested, you should use update.packages() instead
of install.packages(). 

Also, what happens if you try to do the update in R and not from
RStudio?  I.e. start R and say update.packages() in R?

What does the command 'getOption(pkgType)' output on your machine?  It
should be "both" for either binary or source package.  If it is
"mac.binary" you should investigate where that is set and why your
system is configured to install binary packages early.

Finally, you can always recall the command: 

> install.packages(c("DBI", "parallelly", "segmented", "survival", "V8"))

and modify it to:

> install.packages(c("DBI", "parallelly", "segmented", "survival", "V8"), type = "source")

This, of course, assumes that you have the tools installed to compile
source packages.

Best wishes,
	
	Berwin

Subject: [R] Capturing Function Arguments
Message-ID: <CALOkxuyq6-Ka70A5obg-OY-choUEC4s69aLKgEXEbFiodEL2qw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm wrapping a function in R and I want to record all the arguments
passed to it, including default values and missing values. I want to
be able to snoop on function calls in sourced scripts as part of a
unit testing framework.

I can capture the values fine, but I'm having trouble evaluating them
as if `force()` had been applied to each of them.

Here is a minimal example:

f0 <- function(x, y = 2 * z, z, a = NULL, b) NULL

f <- function(...) {
  call <- rlang::call_match(fn = f0, defaults = TRUE)
  args <- rlang::call_args(call)
  # do something here to evaluate args as if force() had been called
  # I've tried many things but haven't found a solution that handled everything
  args
}

# In the below example args1 and args2 should be the same
a <- 1
args1 <- f(a, z = 1 + 100)

args2 <- list( a = 1, y = 202, z = 101, a = NULL, b = rlang::missing_arg() )

If anyone knows how to get this to work, I would appreciate the help.

Thanks,
Reed

Hi Reed,


I need to stress before giving my answer that no solution can handle
everything. These scenarios will always lead to problems:

* if any of the formal arguments rely on the current state of the call stack

* if any of the formal arguments rely on a variable that is only
defined later in the body of the function

That being said, this function does well to handle other scenarios:

```R
f <- function (...)
{
    ## replace f0 as needed
    wrapped_function <- f0
    call <- match.call(wrapped_function, expand.dots = FALSE)
    args <- as.list(call)[-1L]
    e <- new.env(parent = environment(wrapped_function))
    parent_frame <- parent.frame()
    formal_args <- formals(wrapped_function)
    for (sym in names(formal_args)) {
        ## if the formal argument is one of the provided arguments
        if (i <- match(sym, names(args), 0L)) {
            ## if the argument is missing, assign as is
            if (identical(args[[i]], quote(expr = )))
                e[[sym]] <- quote(expr = )
            ## if the argument is not ..., assign as a promise
            else if (sym != "...")
                eval(call("delayedAssign", quote(sym), args[[i]],
eval.env = quote(parent_frame), assign.env = quote(e)))
            else {
                ## handle ... separately
                ## create a variable corresponding to each dot argument,
                ## then capture them with get("...")
                dots <- args[[i]]
                for (i in seq_along(dots)) {
                    sym <- paste0("dd", i)
                    eval(call("delayedAssign", quote(sym), dots[[i]],
eval.env = quote(parent_frame)))
                    dots[[i]] <- as.symbol(sym)
                }
                e[["..."]] <- eval(as.call(c(function(...) get("..."), dots)))
            }
        }
        else {
            ## similar to above, but this time evaluate in e not parent_frame
            i <- match(sym, names(formal_args), 0L)
            if (identical(formal_args[[i]], quote(expr = )))
                e[[sym]] <- quote(expr = )
            else eval(call("delayedAssign", quote(sym),
formal_args[[i]], eval.env = quote(e), assign.env = quote(e)))
        }
    }
    ## you don't need to turn into a list, but you can
    args2 <- as.list(e, all.names = TRUE)
    list(call = call, args = args, args2 = args2, e = e)
    ## do whatever else you want to here
}
```

in the test scenario you described, it works:

```R
f0 <- function(x, y = 2 * z, z, a = NULL, b) NULL
a <- 1
x <- f(a, z = 1 + 100)
x$args2
```

produces:

```
> f0 <- function(x, y = 2 * z, z, a = NULL, b) NULL
> a <- 1
> x <- f(a, z = 1 + 100)
> x$args2
$x
[1] 1

$y
[1] 202

$z
[1] 101

$a
NULL

$b

```

    Iris

This is hard if not impossible to implement for the general case
because the default arguments are evaluated in the environment of the
function as it is running:

f0 <- function(arg = frobnicate()) {
 frobnicate <- switch(
  sample.int(3, 1),
  function() environment(),
  function(n=1) runif(n),
  function() alist(a=)$a
 )
 arg
}

(And some arguments aren't meant to be evaluated at all.)

Even starting with rlang::call_match(call = NULL, defaults = TRUE) is
doomed to a certain extent because it gives you f(x = a, a = NULL) for
both function(x, a = NULL), f(a) (where `a` passed as an argument `x`
and `a` should be taken from the parent frame) and function(x = a, a =
NULL), f() (in which case `x` defaults to `a`, which in turn defaults
to NULL).

I think the key here is evaluating the arguments first, then matching.
This makes a lot of assumptions about the function being inspected: no
NSE, no ellipsis, formals don't depend on the body, nothing weird about
the environment of the function...

f <- function(...) {
 .makemissing <- function() alist(a=)$a
 .ismissing <- function(x) identical(x, .makemissing())

 # prepare to evaluate formals
 params <- formals(f0)
 e <- new.env(parent = environment(f0))

I need to read csv files repeatedly, named data1.csv, data2.csv,? data24.csv, 24 altogether. That is, 

data<-read.csv(?data1.csv?)
?
data<-read.csv(?data24.csv?)
?

Is there a way to do this in a loop? Thank you.

Steven,

It depends what you want to do. What you are showing seems to replace the values stored in "data" each time.

Many kinds of loops will do that, with one simple way being to store all the filenames in a list and loop on the contents of the list as arguments to read.csv.

Since you show filenames as having a number from 1 to 24 in middle, you can make such a vector using paste().

A somewhat related question is if you want to concatenate all the data into one larger data.frame.

}
for (filename in paste0("data", 1:24, ".csv")) f(filename)

Depending on what exactly you have in your file system,

for (filename in system("ls data*.csv", TRUE)) f(filename)

might work.

Hello,

Here is a way of reading the files in a *apply loop. The file names are 
created by getting them from file (list.files) or by a string editing 
function (sprintf).


# file_names_vec <- list.files(pattern = "data\\d+\\.csv")
file_names_vec <- sprintf("data%d.csv", 1:24)
data_list <- sapply(file_names_vec, read.csv, simplify = FALSE)

# access the 1st data.frame
data_list[[1L]]
# same as above
data_list[["data1.csv"]]
# same as above
data_list$data1.csv


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

In my package HelpersMG, I have included a function to read in one time 
all the files of a folder and they are stored in a list:

read_folder(
 ? folder = try(file.choose(), silent = TRUE),
 ? file = NULL,
 ? wildcard = "*.*",
 ? read = read.delim,
 ? ...
)

In your case, for example:

library("HelpersMG")
data_list <- read_folder(folder=".", file=paste0("data", 
as.character(1:24),".csv"), read=read.csv)
data_df <- ? do.call("rbind", data_list)

Thanks Ivan and Iris for your solutions, I'll look over them.

The solution that I came up with last night involves creating a
function that has the same formals signature as the wrapped function
and relying on `environment()` and `list(...)` to return a function's
variables at the beginning of the call. Since some default variables
can't be successfully created at the beginning of the function, I
manually clean up the formals as needed so that
`as.list(environment())` won't fail. I'm thinking about returning a
copy of the environment instead of a list to avoid having to clean up
the formals, as I can selectively ignore problematic arguments later
instead of modifying the signature ahead of time.

Thanks again for the suggestions,
Reed

```
capture <- function(fun, env = parent.frame()) {
    fun_name <- deparse(substitute(fun))
    # extract formal arguments and append ... if needed
    fmls <- formals(fun)
    if(! "..." %in% names(fmls)) {
        fmls <- c(fmls, alist("..." = ))
    }

    # construct wrapped function
    f <- function() TRUE
    formals(f) <- fmls
    body(f) <- bquote({
        args <- as.list(environment())
        args <- c(args, list(...))
        mc <- match.call()
        mc[[1L]] <- quote(.(substitute(fun)))
        res <- eval.parent(mc)
        out <- list(fun = .(fun_name),
            args = args,
            result = res
        )
        invisible(structure(out, class="function_call"))
    })
    environment(f) <- env
    return(f)
}

# example usage
hist <- capture(graphics::hist.default)
formals(hist) <- c(formals(hist), list(xname = NA_character_))
```

Is it possible that there is a version skew between binaries and source packages?

If you try the RStudio Update option, which versions does it claim that you have installed? If it is the same versions that you download, then no wonder that the update doesn't change anything.

E.g. I see that you have been downloading survival_3.5-7.tgz for arm64, but this is now updated to 3.5-8, so maybe it wasn't looking at available binaries, but possibly at available source packages.

No warning, no error, but also no updated packages. utils::install.packages(c("DBI", "parallelly", "segmented", "survival", "V8")) leads to the exact same output. The only difference, if I run it directly from command-line is, that I have to select a mirror. After that it's again the same output. The DBI package for example is installed with version 1.2.0, which is the latest available macOS arm64 binary. However, there is an update available for other binaries or source. So, I guess in the end, it's not the install.packages() that is failing, but the check for updates from RStudio. On the other hand, shouldn't there be at least a warning that there are new updates available, just no new binaries.

Message-ID: <A21650AA-EB37-40F0-8A4B-558A3683FDA4@ntu.edu.tw>

How can I call and include an external set of R codes, not necessarily a complete procedure (which can be include with a ?source? command). Example:

#I like to include and run the following lines residing in a file outside the main program:

mydata<-transform(mydata,
a<-b+c
d<-e+f
}

I believe you will have to expain what you want more fully, as what you
requested appears to be exactly what source() does, to me anyway. Please
reread its help file more carefully perhaps?

Are you asking to source lines 5-10 of a file for instance?

Never seen that done in R. Feels a dodgy thing to do as changing line will
screw things up.  On the other hand - I'd often have functions in a file
called perhaps "functions.R" and source("functions.R")

Then I can call an individual function something like

tranform_mydata(mydata)



With the functions.R containing

transform_mydata <- function (mydata) {

mydata<-transform(mydata,
a<-b+c
d<-e+f

return(mydata)
}

I am writing my master thesis in which I compared two cultures . So for my statistics I need to compare Age,Sex,Culture as well as have a look at the tasks scores .

Anyone familiar with this ?
I?d love to share my script so you guide me where I did wrong .

What happens if you add a line to the code in lines 1-5.  So line 5 is now
line 6 etc?

Your "procedure" needs a name

So either it's a function, OR, we each procedure is a file to source?

Maybe I missed the rest of the post? You are more likely to get help with
your problems if you create a minimal reproducible example.

... and if the problem is networking, then you will likely need help from someone who knows your local configuration. Employers often do things that limit what R can do, and none of us are likely to know about those things.

(1) This post is far too vague to be appropriate for this list.

(2) You should learn some statistics; probably linear modelling.

(3) You should talk to your thesis advisor.

(4) Please see fortunes::fortune(285).

Regarding 1 and 2, please read the Posting Guide mentioned at the bottom of every R-help post. R does not equal statistics... and education about statistics is way too ambitious to include in this mailing list that is about a tool that happens to be useful for statisticians.

There are forums online that do cater to statistical methods (e.g. Cross Validated or many results from a search engine)... but such conversations can be extensive so as Rolf suggests this is a good time to learn what resources your educational institutions can provide... online forums may be too limiting when your questions are so vague.

Hi Stephen,
I didn?t see this suggested previously, but yes I have made repeated attempts to gain access to CRAN via R but to no avail. Mirroring CRAN is a really good idea, but I?m not sure how to get R to recognise the local file locations when the installation files seek access to CRAN via urls. Thanks again for your help.

As stated in an earlier email, this might be better directed to your IT? You might think about mirroring CRAN locally, but this would be non-trivial.

Hi Stephen,
Thanks very much for getting back to me. My problem is described below. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, James

Hi,
Sorry for bothering you because I know that your time is voluntary, but I would really appreciate some help. I work in a hospital in part of Ireland?s national health service, a service which was struck by a massive cyber attack a couple of years ago. Since then their security has been very tight, and I can?t access the internet through my R or R Studio. To install packages I need to download the files through a browser (Chrome by default) and install them from the files, which is very tedious when you consider the amount of dependencies, but I?m happy to do it.

This was working fine until yesterday when I had error messages trying to install some packages. See enclosed ?S2? for example. It looks like it is trying to download a file as part of the installation, but of course can?t. If you could help with this I would be very grateful. Other examples are jqr, protolite, curl.

I came across a different error message when trying to install openssl, although the issue may be the same. For this package it says

Warning in file(name, "wb") :
  cannot open file 'openssl/tests/keys/message.rsa.crypt': Permission denied
Error in file(name, "wb") : cannot open the connection

I have tried going into the archive of these packages and installing older versions, but no luck with those either.
I hope you can help. Best wishes, James

Since you're on Windows and running R-4.3, it should be easier to
download and install the binary package,
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/contrib/4.3/s2_1.1.6.zip.

Installing this package from source involves downloading a few binaries
anyway. You could try unpacking the source package, downloading OpenSSL
1.1.1k binaries from https://github.com/rwinlib/openssl/tree/v1.1.1k
into a new subdirectory called windows/ in the package root, just like
the https://github.com/r-spatial/s2/blob/main/tools/winlibs.R script
tries to do during the installation, then installing the resulting
directory as if it was a source package.

Hi Stephen,
Thanks very much for getting back to me. My problem is described below. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, James

Hi,
Sorry for bothering you because I know that your time is voluntary, but I would really appreciate some help. I work in a hospital in part of Ireland?s national health service, a service which was struck by a massive cyber attack a couple of years ago. Since then their security has been very tight, and I can?t access the internet through my R or R Studio. To install packages I need to download the files through a browser (Chrome by default) and install them from the files, which is very tedious when you consider the amount of dependencies, but I?m happy to do it.

This was working fine until yesterday when I had error messages trying to install some packages. See enclosed ?S2? for example. It looks like it is trying to download a file as part of the installation, but of course can?t. If you could help with this I would be very grateful. Other examples are jqr, protolite, curl.

I came across a different error message when trying to install openssl, although the issue may be the same. For this package it says

Warning in file(name, "wb") :
  cannot open file 'openssl/tests/keys/message.rsa.crypt': Permission denied
Error in file(name, "wb") : cannot open the connection

I have tried going into the archive of these packages and installing older versions, but no luck with those either.
I hope you can help. Best wishes, James

Dear James,

the fact you can download the packages via Chrome but not in R/RStudio might indicate that your browser uses a proxy server that is not known to R. Maybe you have to configure it (e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6467277/proxy-setting-for-r#8297685) appropriately?

Best regards,

Hilmar

Hi Stephen,
Thanks again for getting back to me, Ivan Krylov responded also and suggested windows binaries and I must confess I was only familiar with installing from files via the package sources (apart from the conventional install.packages method), so the solution was as simple as installing via the binaries. Thanks again, best wishes, James

My suggestion is probably overkill. Sorry about that. I don't know much about windows.

Have you tried posit package manager? Maybe that is not blocked? I think windows binaries are installable from there?

A workaround, that I don't think I would suggest, might be RSelinium to automate the download process since it seems you have web access?

Best of luck!
Kindest regards,

Hi Stephen,
I didn?t see this suggested previously, but yes I have made repeated attempts to gain access to CRAN via R but to no avail. Mirroring CRAN is a really good idea, but I?m not sure how to get R to recognise the local file locations when the installation files seek access to CRAN via urls. Thanks again for your help.

As stated in an earlier email, this might be better directed to your IT? You might think about mirroring CRAN locally, but this would be non-trivial.

Hi Stephen,
Thanks very much for getting back to me. My problem is described below. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, James

Hi,
Sorry for bothering you because I know that your time is voluntary, but I would really appreciate some help. I work in a hospital in part of Ireland?s national health service, a service which was struck by a massive cyber attack a couple of years ago. Since then their security has been very tight, and I can?t access the internet through my R or R Studio. To install packages I need to download the files through a browser (Chrome by default) and install them from the files, which is very tedious when you consider the amount of dependencies, but I?m happy to do it.

This was working fine until yesterday when I had error messages trying to install some packages. See enclosed ?S2? for example. It looks like it is trying to download a file as part of the installation, but of course can?t. If you could help with this I would be very grateful. Other examples are jqr, protolite, curl.

I came across a different error message when trying to install openssl, although the issue may be the same. For this package it says

Warning in file(name, "wb") :
  cannot open file 'openssl/tests/keys/message.rsa.crypt': Permission denied
Error in file(name, "wb") : cannot open the connection

I have tried going into the archive of these packages and installing older versions, but no luck with those either.
I hope you can help. Best wishes, James

Lisa, this seems to be fairly straight forward to do in R and I'm happy to help you get started. However, please be aware that you do have to have knowledge of statistics to do the analysis/modeling.  

Rolf, Jeff, I do appreciate your view that this is not a R probelm. It's more a 'how to use R' / 'help me get started' problem. The posting guidelines point to "Usenet groups sci.stat.consult (applied statistics and consulting) and sci.stat.math (mathematical stat and probability)." Since Google announced [1] that Google groups will not support new usenet content starting tomorrow, would it make sense to have a r-consult mailing list or tag it [consult] on r-help?

Subject: [R] Extracting Plot Arguments
Message-ID: <CALOkxuw+DhRV_mQ4qA_TfMeHdQTREq927Tt32-3wyqMmGcrE3g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I'm building an autograding framework for my biostatistics class this
semester, and I am exploring different ways to automatically grade
figures.

In other classes, I teach ggplot2 and I extract information directly
from the ggplot2 object. However, in this class we are using base R
and I need to extract information from base-r graphics.

I've tried several different approaches, but I'm not sure which one is
the easiest and most effective. Has anyone ever tried this? Are there
any packages to help with this?

(1) Storing `recordedplots` objects and trying to extract information
from them. This data structure felt very low level, and I wasn't sure
how easy it was to map the results to user-level function calls.

(2) Use the `svglite` device to produce svg files, which can be
parsed. This also worked, but required a lot of code to parse the
resulting images and identify things like labels, and coordinate
locations. I got tired of having to figure how to extract information
from an SVG.

(3) Use a wrapper on specific graphics functions that records the
function arguments. This turns out to be a bit too high level, as I
have to manually massage inputs. E.g. handle both xy plots and formula
+ data plots. (We teach both styles.)

Are there any other ideas that I can try? My students are using an
RMarkdown worksheet and answering questions by putting code in
specific chunks. I've already hooked into knitr so I can record the
chunk lines as they are being run and  get the results and
side-effects.

Thanks,
Reed

   I agree that the posting guide is due for updating.

   If the mailing list maintainers were willing I think r-consult might 
not be a terrible idea. I do think the center of gravity has moved to 
Cross Validated, and it might be minimally sufficient to point people 
there (or Math Overflow for probability/math questions) rather than 
starting a new group.

Attached to this email you will find my code and data I used to run
this formula.

Thanks in advance.

Does the grid.echo function in the gridGraphics package do what you want?

Description
Convert a scene that was drawn using the graphics package to an identical scene drawn with the

The data came through fine, the program was a miss. Can you paste the program into a ".txt" document like a notepad file and send that? You could also paste it into your email IF your email is configured to send text and NOT html.

This may be a dumb question and the answer may make me feel dumber.
 
I have had trouble for years with R packages wanting Rtools on my machine
and not being able to use it. Many packages are fine as binaries are
available. I have loaded Rtools and probably need to change my PATH or
something.
 
But I recently suggested to someone that they might want to use the tabyl()
function in the janitor package that I find helpful. I get a warning when I
install it about Rtools but it works fine. When they install it, it fails. I
assumed they would get it from CRAN the same way I did as we are both using
Windows and from within RSTUDIO.
 
In the past, I have run into other packages I could not use and just moved
on but it seems like time to see if this global problem has a work-around.
 
And, in particular, I have the latest versions of both R and RSTUDIO which
can be a problem when other things are not as up-to-date.
 
Or, maybe some people with R packages could be convinced to make binaries
available in the first place?

Avi ,
Your question is not dumb. Let me ask a more fundamental question. What is R tools, what does it do, and how is it used. From time to time, I receive a message when I down load a package saying I need R tools. When I receive the message, I don?t know what I should do, other than down load R tools.

I suppose making sure that whatever directory holds your Rtools code is 
on your path would be a good idea. I wondered if there's an environment 
variable that could be set, but reading the page on using Rtools did not 
mention one until I got down to the section on building R from source 
which is surely NOT what you want to do.. You should read the 
information on installation and building packages from source. 
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/howto-R-devel.html which 
includes this sentence:

"It is recommended to use the defaults and install into|c:/rtools43|. 
When done that way, Rtools43 may be used in the same R session which 
installed it or which was started before Rtools43 was installed."

Binaries are automatically produced by CRAN but perhaps you are trying 
to install from some other source? It would help if you could be 
specific about several missing pieces of information: Operating system, 
R version, Rtools version, current location of Rtools, names of packages 
and where they were obtained.


Regards and good luck;

RTools is a set of command-line programs needed for compiling R and its packages on Windows. You don't need it if your OS is not Windows.

In theory, users on Windows should not need to worry about compiling packages to binary (zip) form, because CRAN compiles the source code for every package that supports Windows and just updating in a few days should bring in the current binaries. In practice, that task seems to always be lagging for certain packages, so you may end up using old versions of packages if you only rely on binary packages. Tidyverse packages seem to be among the worst in this respect.. there are many many dependencies and getting just one old one can make it all but impossible to get a current set of top-level Tidyverse packages. I think this is the strongest argument for teaching beginners to use Bsse R at first... the most plaintive cries come from beginners tasked with preparing their Windows computers to use tidyverse for their "class" at times when the binary files are very out of date.

Once installed and an RtoolsXX directory is present, it is still necessary to add the Rtools\mingw64\bin directory to your PATH environment variable so R can find it. Unfortunately there is no one way to do this because some people use multiple versions of R/Rtools and you can't just add all of them to your PATH. One of my preferred ways is to put the following in a newly-created .Rprofile text file in the Documents directory

Sys.setenv( PATH=paste( "C:\\Rtools43\\mingw64", Sys.getenv( "PATH" ), sep=";" ) )

after restarting R it should be ready to install source packages when needed.

The problem is that beginners rarely remember doing this and after updating to R/Rtools 4.4.0 they will not understand why all their existing packages disappear (they must be reinstalled for each x.y version of R) nor why the source install doesn't work anymore (the 43 in their .Rprofile file which they have long ago forgotten must be updated to 44).

It's specifically designed to provide the code tools missing in Windows 
that would other wise have been provided by a typical Linux distro. More 
expansively, it allows compilation of code written in C and/or Fortran 
using the version that was used to build the matching R version and 
allows it to be called by the routines written in R that bind a package 
together.

The phrase "the rest of the material" is not specific enough to offer 
more explanation. You should quote material that is beyond your 
understanding. You should only be reading the sections named:"Installing 
Rtools43" and "Building packages from source using Rtools43". I doubt 
that material further on would be relevant.

David,

I greatly appreciate the explanation you gave regarding R tools providing tools available in Linux distros, but not found in Windows. (I am using a windows system). Does this mean that Linux users don't need to use R tools when they want to compile R code?

Additionally, thank you for the information about what I should read. I will look at the material again, and hopefully things the material you suggest I read will be more understandable.

John

P.S. This email should be in txt format, not html. I sent if from my desktop windows machine which provides more options than does my iPhone.

I suppose making sure that whatever directory holds your Rtools code is
on your path would be a good idea. I wondered if there's an environment
variable that could be set, but reading the page on using Rtools did not
mention one until I got down to the section on building R from source
which is surely NOT what you want to do.. You should read the
information on installation and building packages from source.
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/howto-R-devel.html<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/howto-R-devel.html> which
includes this sentence:

"It is recommended to use the defaults and install into|c:/rtools43|.
When done that way, Rtools43 may be used in the same R session which
installed it or which was started before Rtools43 was installed."


But I recently suggested to someone that they might want to use the tabyl()
function in the janitor package that I find helpful. I get a warning when I
install it about Rtools but it works fine. When they install it, it fails. I
assumed they would get it from CRAN the same way I did as we are both using
Windows and from within RSTUDIO.

In the past, I have run into other packages I could not use and just moved
on but it seems like time to see if this global problem has a work-around.

And, in particular, I have the latest versions of both R and RSTUDIO which
can be a problem when other things are not as up-to-date.

Or, maybe some people with R packages could be convinced to make binaries
available in the first place?

Binaries are automatically produced by CRAN but perhaps you are trying
to install from some other source? It would help if you could be
specific about several missing pieces of information: Operating system,
R version, Rtools version, current location of Rtools, names of packages
and where they were obtained.

Yes. That?s been true for me anyway. On a Mac I need to make sure I have the proper C and Fortran compilers and the proper environment variables , which are always provided by Saint  Simon Urbanek at the att.research site.

Subject: [R] Clustering Functions used by Reverse-Dependencies
Message-ID: <VI1P192MB0095C4BE0EB8BE16FAABD3D884542@VI1P192MB0095.EURP192.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear R Users,

Are there any tools to extract the function names called by reverse-dependencies?

I would like to group these functions using clustering methods based on the co-occurrence in the reverse-dependencies.

Utility: It may be possible to split complex packages into modules with fewer reverse-dependencies.

Package pkgdepR may offer some of the functionality; but I did not have time to fully explore it:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pkgdepR/index.html

If such tools are not yet available, I have opened an issue on GitHub and would like to collect any ideas:
https://github.com/discoleo/PackageBrowser/issues/1

There are some model packages that could be used to test the clustering:
1) Rcpp, xml: the core-functionality will always be needed; splitting into modules may not be possible/useful;

2) pracma: most reverse-dependencies are likely using only a small subset of the functions in pracma;
(there was some discussion on R-package-devel about reverse dependencies a few weeks ago)

3) survival: I have no idea in which category it falls - but it has a lot of reverse-dependencies;

Note:
I missed some important functionality from the pkgsearch package. I have started therefore work on a new package (PackageBrowser) - although it is not yet published on CRAN:
https://github.com/discoleo/PackageBrowser

It does not yet process recursively the reverse-dependencies; although this does not seem a big challenge. The real challenge is to parse the code and extract function names. I did some work in the past, but never had time for a full implementation.

Many thanks,

Leonard

Dear R-community

 

It would be nice to get some input how to find a solution for the following
error in igraph and vertex setting.

 

Thank you very much

Sibylle

The reason html is specifically advised against as a format is that it 
does things like mangling data such as is happening in your example. You 
should repost using settings on you mail client for plain-text. Your 
code should start by loading necessary packages. You should also not 
post screen output versions of code since that will insert lots of 
superfluous "+"'s. Some but not all API will be able to strip those 
characters.

Hi,

first of all, your example was not reproducible! But once I added
"library(igraph)" and "library(scico)" plus generally replaced
"aes_collapsed" by "edge_list", I started to work :-)

Anyway, the error is produced by this line:

+     edge.width= network,

It seems to me that you have forgotten to name a variable here (you now
use the whole network object as variable, which most probably won't
work).

Just as a kind advice for the future: if you encounter errors like
this, it is always a good idea to debug the problematic code by
commenting it out line by line. So you will - most probably - find our
those sections resulting in errors.

HTH,

Kimmo

After copying your lead in that replacement the error I got was:


network <- graph_from_data_frame(edge_list, directed= FALSE, + vertices 
= details) #Error: object 'details' not found Same conclusion, though.

Subject: [R] Data consideration in executing pca
Message-ID: <CA+z=Sy3FhdcOChbG0B+h8TAYLfHsPoAFgZnzMp+DhbekkK5WDw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

 I have a txt file named 'data_1.txt' whose first column contains the names
of the individuals and the other columns contain the values of four
variables X_1,X_2,X_3 and X_4. I read it with R from its location and
called it data. I'd like to do a normalized principal component analysis. I
started by calculating the correlation matrix:
cor(data)
 I got the following message:
Error in cor(nnotes) : 'x' must be numeric.
I eliminated the first column of names, then read the modified data and
then added the names of individuals with rownames. I was able to run PCA
and obtain graphical representations of the variables, their coordinates,
contributions and cos2. However, when I used fviz_pca_ind to get the
graphical representation of the individuals, I got a graphic that considers
the variables as individuals. Can you please help me? I have attached the
file data_1 .txt file.

Many thanks in advance.

am using.


setwd("mydir")

dtb <- read.table(file="test.txt",header = TRUE)

ar.ols(x=dtb[2:6966,],demean=FALSE,intercept = TRUE,
       prewhite=TRUE)

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [R] Interactions in regression
Message-ID: <CAGyzeZpWKbYmCsLCCi+=Bksz8EX6O1X9r372fxDBfzsd1GwkJw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
I stumbled upon some topics regarding interactions in anova and regression
and packages for tabulating and visualizations the results of them.
Here we are:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77933272/how-to-add-a-reference-level-for-interaction-in-gtsummary-and-sjplot/77935742#77935742
,
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78016795/how-to-add-reference-levels-for-interaction-in-r?noredirect=1&lq=1
.
I was wondering because I usually use GUI software and these questions did
not get answers, if from a technical point of view
how to do it, using these (sjPlot, gtsummary) or other ways to make such
tables, inserting the reference levels of these mentioned interactions.
This is not likely to be used in publications (including three base
levels), but from the point of view of solving the topics this questions
have interested me.
I tried myself to make it happen, but so far without success.
I recall this reprex based on SO:

set.seed(1000)
my_data <- rbind(
  data.frame(time = "Pre", treatment = "Control", response =
rnorm(100, mean=1)),
  data.frame(time = "Pre", treatment = "Treatment", response =
rnorm(100, mean=2)),
  data.frame(time = "Post", treatment = "Control", response =
rnorm(100, mean=1)),
  data.frame(time = "Post", treatment = "Treatment", response =
rnorm(100, mean=2))
) %>% mutate(time = factor(time, levels = c("Pre", "Post")))
%>%mutate(treatment = factor(treatment, levels = c("Control",
"Treatment")))
model3 <- lm(response ~ time * treatment, data = my_data)

Thanks,
Jacek

It is trivial in R to add whatever decorations to a plot that you would
like, but that requires that you go beyond point and click production of
graphics and write actual code. If you are unwilling or unable to do this,
you are stuck with whatever various packaged graphics functionality
provides.So you might want to search on "interaction plots for linear
models in R" or similar at rseek.org or in your favorite web search engine
if you haven't already done so. My minimal efforts brought up lots of hits,
though none may be useful for your concerns, especially, as has already
been pointed out, as your query doesn't seem to make much sense
statistically.

Cheers,
Bert

Hi again,

your code is still not reproducible without modifications, but I
succeed in getting the data straight. All read.csv-command are missing
'sep="\t"', it is need to read you tsv-data.

And it could be more reproducible if you used e.g.

--- snip ---
aes<-read.csv(text="    A.A	B.B	C.C	D.D	E.E	F.F
A.A	0	0	5	5	5	5
B.B	4	0	1	1	1	1
C.C	5	5	0	5	4	2
D.D	5	0	5	0	5	3
E.E	5	1	5	5	0	4
F.F	1	2	3	4	5	5",?
sep="\t", row.names = 1)
--- snip ---

This would save us from unnecessary copy-pasting :-)

However, the error is still the same I mentioned in my first reply,
i.e.:

network %>% plot(
    vertex.color=clrs[V(.)$community], 
    vertex.size=V(.)$hub_score*5, 
    vertex.frame.color=V(.)$color, 
    vertex.label.color="white", 
    vertex.label.cex=0.5, 
    vertex.label.family="Helvetica",
    vertex.label.font=1,
    edge.curved=0.5,
HERE -->    edge.width= network,  <-- HERE
    layout=layout_with_mds(.))

Try to comment out his line and see what happens. What network data
variable should be mapped to edge width?

Best,
Kimmo

Hi,

a quick additional note: try

"edge.width= E(.)$weight"

instead of the current "edge.width= network". Seems to work and makes a
visible difference...

HTH,
Kimmo

Dear Kimmo

First of all many thanks for the valuable advice to publish code and csv. Noted. 
Yes, "edge.width= E(.)$weight" makes definitively sense.

In the following code, which loads the tiff file, I get the following error
tiff("figures/AES_network_bymembership.tiff", width=1000, height=700, res=120)
Warning message:
In doTryCatch(return(expr), name, parentenv, handler) : Character set family not found in the Windows character set database

--> I am unsure if mySQL is the right solution. I have no experience how to change mySQL.

Kind regards
Sibylle


tiff("figures/AES_network_bymembership.tiff", width=1000, height=700, res=120)
network %>%
  ggraph(., layout = "auto")+
  geom_edge_arc(curvature=0.3, aes(width=(E(network)$weight/10), color=from, alpha=0.5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = V(network)$hub_score*200, color= as.factor(V(network)$community))) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label =  V(network)$name), size=5, color="white", repel=T)+
  scale_color_scico_d(palette = "batlow")+
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2,4))+
  scale_size(range = c(0.5,20)) +
  #scale_edge_color_manual(values = c(scico(21, palette="batlow")))+
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "black"),
        legend.position = "right",
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black"))
dev.off()

Hi,

a quick additional note: try

"edge.width= E(.)$weight"

instead of the current "edge.width= network". Seems to work and makes a visible difference...

HTH,

Hi,
I do not want to make a plot, I try to make an output table in R, (in GUI
like Stata this is trivially easy task)
with regard to SO OP question. As I mentioned, in paper I would not do
this, but out of curiosity I use R this time trying to create it.
If in R this is trivial task as well, could you please show how to do it ?
After googling a lot I did not find solution.
regards,
Jacek

SIBYLLE ST?CKLI via R-help <r-help at r-project.org> ?????:

This warning is definitely worth investigating, but it shouldn't
interrupt your code. Does the figure come out wrong after you see this
warning?

> In doTryCatch(return(expr), name, parentenv, handler) : Character set
> family not found in the Windows character set database

I see you've tried to do the right thing and searched for the warning
message. Unfortunately, the search engines are wrong; this doesn't seem
related to MySQL.

A similarly-worded warning message exists in the Windows-related font
functions inside R:

>> warning(_("font family not found in Windows font database"))

If running a sufficiently new version of R, try Sys.setLanguage('en')
before reproducing the problem and searching for the exact warning
message in double quotes. (Reset it back using
Sys.setLanguage(your_language_code) or restart R afterwards.)
Translated error and warning messages are good for understanding, but
they fragment the search engine results.

I see that a few messages back you set a font family:

>      vertex.label.family="Helvetica",

R probably doesn't know where to get it in order to render the plot as
TIFF. If you have a copy of Helvetica installed in your system, try
registering it using windowsFonts(Helvetica = windowsFont("how the
font is named in the system")). (See help(windowsFonts) for more
information.) Otherwise you may be limited to R's predefined font
families.

It's annoying that "Helvetica" exists for PDF plots and such seemingly
without a problem, but if you change the output format to TIFF, the set
of fonts available to you changes too. Unfortunately, there are
multiple different font rendering engines in play, and their predefined
lists of fonts also differ.

Dear Ivan

Thanks a lot.

I used:
windowsFonts(Helvetica = windowsFont("Helvetica"))
No warning now with Helvetica
Additionally I used "sans", similarly no warning  in the first part.

But still not able to open tiff with both versions:

Using "stress" as default layout
> dev.off()
TIFFOpen: figures/AES_network_bymembership.tiff: Cannot open.
RStudioGD 
        2 
Warning message:
In dev.off() :
  unable to open TIFF file 'figures/AES_network_bymembership.tiff'

Kind regards
Sibylle

This warning is definitely worth investigating, but it shouldn't interrupt your code. Does the figure come out wrong after you see this warning?

I see you've tried to do the right thing and searched for the warning message. Unfortunately, the search engines are wrong; this doesn't seem related to MySQL.

A similarly-worded warning message exists in the Windows-related font functions inside R:

>> warning(_("font family not found in Windows font database"))

If running a sufficiently new version of R, try Sys.setLanguage('en') before reproducing the problem and searching for the exact warning message in double quotes. (Reset it back using
Sys.setLanguage(your_language_code) or restart R afterwards.) Translated error and warning messages are good for understanding, but they fragment the search engine results.

I see that a few messages back you set a font family:

>      vertex.label.family="Helvetica",

R probably doesn't know where to get it in order to render the plot as TIFF. If you have a copy of Helvetica installed in your system, try registering it using windowsFonts(Helvetica = windowsFont("how the font is named in the system")). (See help(windowsFonts) for more
information.) Otherwise you may be limited to R's predefined font families.

It's annoying that "Helvetica" exists for PDF plots and such seemingly without a problem, but if you change the output format to TIFF, the set of fonts available to you changes too.

In the current directory (see getwd()), is there a subdirectory named
"figures"? Do you have write access to this subdirectory? Is there a
file named "AES_network_bymembership.tiff" in the subdirectory named
"figures"? Could it be open by a different program and therefore
locked?

Unfortunately, libtiff doesn't seem to provide any more information
regarding why it couldn't open the file at this point.

I have no real idea what you are trying to do, but if a table is
what you want, you can probably get it using the table() function.
Or, more likely, the xtabs() function.

Using your example from an earlier post (adjusted to make it
comprehensible to the human mind):

set.seed(1000)
time      <- factor(rep(c("Pre","Post"),each=200))
treatment <- factor(rep(rep(c("Control","Treatment"),each=100),2))
mu        <- rep(rep(1:2,each=100),2)
response  <- rnorm(400,mean=mu)
xmpldata  <- data.frame(time=time,treatment=treatment,response)
mod       <- lm(response~time*treatment,data=xmpldata)
yhat      <- fitted(mod)
xtb       <- with(xmpldata,xtabs(yhat ~ time+treatment))

print(xtb)

>       treatment
> time     Control Treatment
>   Post  94.10501 201.99112
>   Pre  101.63792 210.04248

Is that (something like) what you want?

Subject: [R] converting MATLAB -> R | element-wise operation
Message-ID: <8ec0980a-1988-484d-bd30-6837f5467e1a@gmail.com>

So, trying to convert a very long, somewhat technical bit of lin alg 
MATLAB code to R. Most of it working, but raninto a stumbling block that 
is probaably simple enough for someone to explain.

Basically, trying to 'line up' MATLAB results from an element-wise 
division of a matrix by a vector with R output.

Here is a simplified version of the MATLAB code I'm translating:

NN = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6];? % Example matrix
lambda = [2, 3, 4];? % Example vector
result_matlab = NN ./ lambda;

which yields

 ?0.50000?? 0.66667?? 0.75000
 ?2.00000?? 1.66667?? 1.50000


So, the only way I have stumbled onto in R to generate the same results 
is to use 'sweep'. The following 'works', but I'm hoping someone can 
explain why I need something as convoluted as this seems (to me, at least).

NN <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)? # Example matrix
lambda <- c(2, 3, 4)? # Example vector
sweep(NN, 2, lambda, "/")


 ???? [,1]????? [,2] [,3]
[1,]? 0.5 0.6666667 0.75
[2,]? 2.0 1.6666667 1.50

First tried the more 'obvious' NN/lambda, but that yields 'the wrong 
answer' (based solely on what I'm trying to accomplish):


 ?????? [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,] 0.500000? 0.5? 1.0
[2,] 1.333333? 2.5? 1.5

So, why 'sweep'?

Why anything but sweep?

The fundamental data type in Matlab is a matrix... they don't have vectors, they have Nx1 matrices and 1xM matrices.

Vectors don't have any concept of "row" vs. "column". Straight division is always elementwise with recycling as needed, and matrices are really vectors in row-major order:

1 2 3
4 5 6

is really

1 4 2 5 3 6

and when you do straight division NN / lambda then lambda is repeated:

1 4 2 5 3 6
2 3 4 2 3 4

to get

0.5 1.3 0.5 2.5 1.0 1.5

but if you transpose first

1 4
2 5
3 6

then that corresponds to an underlying vector:

1 2 3 4 5 6

which lines up with lambda in t(NN)/lambda as:

1 2 3 4 5 6
2 3 4 2 3 4

to obtain:

0.50 0.67 0.75 2.0 1.67 1.50

and inherits the dimensions of t(NN):

0.50 2.00
0.67 1.67
0.75 1.50

which can be transposed back as in t( t( NN ) / lambda ):

0.50 0.67 0.75
2.00 1.67 1.50

but that requires a lot of moving elements around while sweep does not.

Operators are not necessarily "better" than named functions... they just look different.

For well-behaved packages that declare their dependencies correctly,
parsing the NAMESPACE for importFrom() and import() calls should give
you the explicit imports. (What if the package imports the whole
dependency? The safe assumption is that all functions are used, but it
comes with false positives. You could also walk the package code
looking for function names that may belong to the imported package, but
that may involve both false positives and false negatives.)

For the rest of the imports and uses of weak dependencies, you'll have
to walk the package code looking for the uses of the `::` operator. See
how R CMD check walks the package code in functions
tools:::.check_packages_used and codetools::checkUsage.

A less-well-behaved package can always load a namespace during runtime
and choose the functions to call depending on the phase of the moon or
weather on Jupiter. For these, like for the halting problem, there's no
general solution: the package could be written to say, "if Leonard's
function says I'm about to call foo::bar, I won't do it, otherwise I
will".

Is there as way to initialize a vector (matrix) with an unknown length 
(dimension)? NULL does not seem to work. The lines below work with a 
vector of length 4 and a matrix of 4 x 4. What if I do not know 
initially the length/dimension of the vector/matrix?

All I want is to add up (accumulate)? the vector and matrix as I go 
through the loop.

Or, are there other ways to accumulate such vectors and matrices?

It might depend on what you mean with this statement, but I would be
very surprised if MATLAB is not storing matrices in column-major form,
just as R does.

NN = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6];

and 

NN = [ [1, 4]' , [2, 5]', [3, 6]' ];

produce the same matrix in MATLAB.

So the default filling of matrices is by row, and there is no
convenient argument to change that.

OK. I initialize real large vector and matrix and then shrink them when 
I use them in the loop. The following lines worked. I'd glad to know of 
better approaches.

bsum<-rep(0,1000); bsum
vsum<-matrix(rep(0,1000000),nrow=1000); vsum
for (ind in 1:3) { mydata <- read.csv(paste0("midata", ind, ".csv"))
...
k<-length(ame.00$bame)
bsum<-bsum[1:k]+ame.00$bame
vsum<-vsum[1:k,1:k]+ame.00$vame
}

Also known as column vectors and row vectors.  :)

They do in (numerical) linear algebra.  And MATLAB was written by
numerical analysts for numerical analysts. :-)  So they distinguish
between row and column vectors.

GAUSS also distinguishes between row and column vectors.

R (and S) does not distinguish between row and column vectors, and is
in this aspect quite unique among the groups of vector-oriented
programming languages (AFAICT).  But  treating every vector as a column
vector, together with the recycling rule, allows for the easy coding of
the matrix/vector calculations that one (mostly) comes across in
statistical computing.  For the rare occasion when this is not true the
sweep() command is provided, typically remembered once one was bitten
by the lack of distinction between row and column vectors. :)

On 

https://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html

the documents:

?Matlab? / R Reference? by David Hiebeler (PDF, 2010-05-25, 52 pages)

and

?R and Octave? by Robin Hankin (Text), a reference sheet translating
between the most common Octave (or Matlab) and R commands

might be useful.  IIRC, I once used them when I had to do something in
Matlab/Octave and used them as reverse-lookup (I know how to do it in
R, how is it done in Matlab??). :-)

Hi Steven,
It's not entirely clear what you actually want to achieve in the end.

As soon as you "know" x1, and assuming that the different "xi" do not 
differ in length in the real application, you know the length of the 
target vector.
Instead of the loop, you can use 'Reduce' without having to initialize a 
starting vector.

# generate sample vectors, put them in a list

xi<-lapply(1:5, \(x)sample(5))

# look at xi
xi

# sum over xi
Reduce("+",xi)

this works also for matrices

# generate sample matrices, put them in a list
Xi<-lapply(1:3, \(x)matrix(sample(16), nrow=4))

# look at them
Xi

# sum over Xi
Reduce("+",Xi)

Hope that helps

Eik

Many thanks for the collective answers -- consider this a thank you to 
the group. I had 'guessed' it had something to do with 'columns then 
rows' or vice versa (MATLAB convention vs R convention), but had never 
heard about 'sweep' before. Most of the time when I run into 'matrix 
orientation' issues, I simply transpose as needed, but that can get 
clunky. 'sweep' has some utility I'll tuck away if needed in future.

Cheers - and thanks again.

There are two ways you could encounter an encoding in R.

First are encoding markers placed on every string object, which declare
the string to be encoded in UTF-8, Latin-1, the native locale encoding,
or ASCII or "bytes". No other encodings are supported. The "encoding"
argument of readLines() sets this marker.

In order to support other encodings, R is able to convert the text as
part of the input/output connections. help(readLines) points you
towards that: you need to set the UTF-16LE encoding on the connection
object.

con <- file(file, encoding = 'UTF16LE')
lines <- readLines(con)
close(con)

"UTF16LE" is not guaranteed to be supported, so see iconvlist() for the
encodings that should work with your build of R.

When you specify LE you are overriding any useful information that the BOM could convey... see https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/370088/is-the-bom-optional-for-utf-16-and-utf-32.

This is a tab delimited text file, despite the ANA extension. It is created by a custom software program that interfaces with some specialized scientific equipment.

Thank you for your help.

What is the problem that you are trying to solve?
Tell me what you want to do, not how you want to do it.

Subject: [R] converting MATLAB -> R | element-wise operation

Agree that sweep is the tool here.  (If you think it is clunky, check how more general array-sweep operations can be done in Matlab.)

However, it isn't really true that sweep isn't  moving things around. Notice the call to aperm() at the end of the code for sweep(): 

    perm <- c(MARGIN, seq_along(dims)[-MARGIN])
    FUN(x, aperm(array(STATS, dims[perm]), order(perm)), ...)

What this essentially does for "our" case is

> rbind(1:3,4:6)/t(matrix(c(2,3,4), 3,2))
     [,1]      [,2] [,3]
[1,]  0.5 0.6666667 0.75
[2,]  2.0 1.6666667 1.50

I.e. take the matrix, create the divisor by replicating STATS to form a matrix of same size. This is easier if the MARGIN indices come first, because the recycling works. So you get the 2x3 matrix by filling a 3x2 and then transposing it (aperm() does this more generally). Finally, just call FUN on the two arrays.
