Dear R-experts,

Here below my R code working but I don't know how I can get the graph (estimated DAG). 
If you could help me to get the graph, many thanks.

Getting help here on non-standard packages -- there are tens of thousands
-- is technically off topic (see the Posting Guide linked below) and hence
you should not be surprised if you do not get a useful reply, though you
may, of course.

You might have better luck posting on r-sig-networks,
https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-networks, as it says on its
homepage that this SIG is specifically for those interested in "graph-
related software" within R.

Hallo

It is not obvious what is your problem. You maybe should go through some 
articles about functions in the package.
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/aee5/cca63aad422c96ee637b5561bb051724d76c.pdf?_ga=2.241710466.1872226166.1648790330-1600227915.1617009045

or maybe you do not have Rgraphviz package installed as required by plotting 
functions of the package.

R> stopifnot(require(Rgraphviz))# needed for all our graph plots

Cheers
Petr

Subject: [R] readxl, read_excel: how colon (:) is read ?
Message-ID: <04b39c28-a42e-1a91-c446-82d53eb873b8@univ-fcomte.fr>

I have a unexpected behaviour reading times with colon from an Excel 
file, using the package readxl.

In an Excel sheet, I have a column with times in hours:minutes, e.g:

Arrival_time
13:39
13:51

When read from R with readxl::read_excel, this gives a tibble column 
with full date by defaut being the last day of 1899. OK. Why not, I know 
that POSIX variables are starting in 1900 after R doc (however I wonder 
why here the defaut is one day before January 1, 1900

> tmp$Arrival_time  [1] "1899-12-31 13:39:00 UTC" "1899-12-31 13:51:00 UTC"

Well, this is not exactly what I want to. I do not care about the year 
and the day... Therefore I decided to import this column as "text" 
explicitely (in order to manage it within R then). And this is what I 
get now:

> read_excel("saisie_data_durban_rapaces_LPO.xlsx",sheet=2,col_types="text")  > tmp$Arrival_time [1] "0.56875000000000009" "0.57708333333333328"

Can someone tell me what happens ?

I would really appreciate to understand the trick...

Probably (but not entirely sure), Excel is storing your text as a number of
days, so 13:38 is a little more than half a day. Open your spreadsheet in
excel and save those columns as text instead of times, that (should) fix
your issue.

Absolutely correct ! I checked in Excel and when I change the format to 
"text", then I get in Excel the same fractional numbers as those 
obtained importing text from R... Hence the issue comes from Excel 
itself. Will find a way to change this format to text in Excel without 
avoiding such conversion...
Thanks Andrew !

Both R and Excel assume a date is associated with every time object. In Excel, when you show a date it is an integer number of days since 1899-12-31 (due to a mistake made early in programming it). Whenever you show a time, it it merely displaying the time portion (fraction of a day) of a date/time. The date part of that value may or may not be 1899-12-31.

With this in mind, you are tilting at windmills hoping to import a "pure time" because no such thing exists in either program. You can choose to render a `POSIXct` as showing only the time portion when you convert it to character if you so choose.

This can be made using the TEXT (TEXTE in the French version) function 
of Excel, hence:

TEXT(M2;"HH:MM")

Changes the time into text, and it can be imported from R as wanted.

Thanks for the infos. Yes, this is exactly what? I did yesterday with 
POSIXct > POSIXlt to go ahead. However I wanted to understand fully what 
happened, hence the call to the list. Jeff and Andrew, now eveything is 
clear to me thanks to you...

Hello,

The following function is probably not very solid, to work with dates 
and times is not trivial, but it converts those Excel numbers correctly.

I don't know with what numbers it fails.


xl_fracday_to_time <- function(x, digits = 0L) {
   old_opts <- options(digits = 20)
   on.exit(options(old_opts))
   if(is.character(x)) {
     x <- as.numeric(x)
   }
   y <- x * 24
   hours <- floor(y + .Machine$double.eps^0.5)
   y <- (y - hours) * 60
   mins <- floor(y + .Machine$double.eps^0.5)
   y <- (y - mins) * 60
   secs <- round(y, digits = digits)
   sprintf("%02d:%02d:%02d", hours, mins, secs)
}

x <- c("0.56875000000000009", "0.57708333333333328")
xl_fracday_to_time(x)
#[1] "13:39:00" "13:51:00"


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Thanks ! An option is also to import from excel as a text, hence getting 
a fractional number of day as character. With as.numeric, it can be 
converted to numeric. The conversion into any unit of a day (hour, 
minutes, etc.) is then easy...
 ?eg. 0.5*24 = 12 hours

Why not simply let readxl read the timestamp as it will naturally and use

    dta$Arrival_time_c <- as.character( dta$Arrival_time, format = "%H:%M" )

... though time data in such a form is remarkably useless for data analysis.

1. Your data was not attached.

3. have you tried searching the web for examples that work? A quick search

No data. Attachments are removed. Send only text. Include program. Did you look at geom_violin() ? try http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-violin-plot-quick-start-guide-r-software-and-data-visualization

If geom_point() is working then geom_violin() should also work. If neither work then the problem is earlier in the program. Possibly in the ggplot() statement, or earlier.

Hi.

Beside advice of others, at least 

str(yourdata)
and the ggplot code is minimum for us to be able to offer some advice.

Preferable way how to send your data is output from

dput(yourdata) or dput(head(yourdata))

Just copy paste to your email.

Cheers
Petr

Subject: [R] 25th anniversary of R-help & new rules for the list
Message-ID: <21bf137e-afc8-11a1-65c3-195f6d674944@mcmaster.ca>

Dear R-help list members,

The first message to the R-help email list was posted by Ross Ihaka 25 
years ago, on April 1, 1997!

On this 25th anniversary of R-help, the official description of the list 
and the rules for posting to it have been modified. The general object 
of these changes is to broaden the topics that are legitimately 
discussed on the R-help list, partly to reflect how the list actually is 
used.

The description of the list at <https://www.r-project.org/mail.html> now 
reads:

------------ snip --------------

The ?main? R mailing list, for discussion about problems and solutions 
encountered using R, including using R packages in the standard R 
distribution and on CRAN; announcements (not covered by R-announce or 
R-packages); the availability of new functionality for R and 
documentation of R; and for posting nice examples and benchmarks.

This is quite an active list with many messages per day. An alternative 
is to subscribe and choose daily digests (in plain or MIME format). Use 
the web interface for information, subscription, archives, etc.

Please read the posting guide before sending a message to the list. In 
particular, if asking for help with a problem, it is important to be 
clear and concrete, and it is almost always advisable to send a minimal 
reproducible example of the problem.

There are many more specific R email lists (see below under ?Special 
Interest Groups?). If a problem is appropriate for one of the more 
specific lists, you are usually more likely to get help by posting to 
the more specific list. For example, a problem specific to R under macOS 
should normally be posted to the R-SIG-Mac list, and a problem 
concerning R software for mixed-effects models should normally be posted 
to the R-SIG-mixed-models list.

R-help is not intended for help with homework or basic-statistics questions.

Bugs in contributed CRAN packages should normally be reported directly 
to the package maintainer (enter the command 
maintainer("package-name")). You may also be able to obtain help with a 
problem from the package maintainer.

Help with R problems is available from a number of sources beyond the R 
email lists. See under ?Help? at the R home page.

------------ snip --------------

We have also modified the brief description of the R-help list in the 
posting guide at <https://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html> and 
(eventually) in the R FAQ.

Best,
John Fox

Subject: [R] Modificatio of function body within a function
Message-ID: <CABxpnnnkEvQceozk4yHaDJruTobUuno5Prhs8n5xmnFkpKdyDg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm working on a presentation regarding the modification of the
function body on-the-fly and just discovered something I don't
understand. I would like to modify a body of the function within a
function, but I see that it is possible only when explicitly referring
to the environment where the function is defined:

fun1 <- function() {
  1
  body(fun1)[[2]] <- "one"
}
fun1()
body(fun1)
#> {
#>     1
#>     body(fun1)[[2]] <- "one"
#> }

fun2 <- function() {
  2
  env <- environment(fun2)
  body(env$fun2)[[2]] <- "two"
}
fun2()
body(fun2)
#> {
#>     "two"
#>     env <- environment(fun2)
#>     body(env$fun2)[[2]] <- "two"
#> }

Can I get some explanation or some links / articles about this,
please? I thought it won't be a difference and I should be able to
modify a function body also in the first case, because I'm changing
something in the parent environment being in the child environment.

Best regards,

Grzegorz

Heh ... These self-referential constructs are certainly puzzles...

Does this help:

fun1 <- function() {
   1
   body(fun1)[[2]] <<- 'one'
   'hi'
}

> fun1
function() {
   1
   body(fun1)[[2]] <<- 'one' ## note the double '<<" assigning to the parent env
   'hi'
}

> fun1()
[1] "hi"

> fun1
function ()
{
    "one" ## the change was made
    body(fun1)[[2]] <<- "one"
    "hi"
}

The point is that assignments within a function occur *within* the
function environment unless otherwise specified (either by <<- or the
use of the 'environment' argument in 'body<-'()  ). This is, of
course, central to the functional programming paradigm of no side
effects (unless explicitly invoked).

NOTE: Correction to this requested if this is wrong in any way!!

Cheers,
Bert

Thank you, I think I can say that I get it, especially when reading
this explanation: "assignments within a function occur *within* the
function environment unless otherwise specified", so this is just like
in the example below:

a <- 4
fun2 <- function() {
  a <- 2
}
fun2()
a
#> [1] 4

a <- 4
fun2 <- function() {
  env <- .GlobalEnv
  env$a <- 2
}
fun2()
a
#> [1] 2

I would like to ask about one more thing, also regarding the
modification of the body of function. There is one phenomenon which
I'm actually using during my work with R, but I'm not sure why this
happens. Below is an example of this:

fun1 <- function() {
  1
  env <- environment(fun1)
  body(env$fun1) <- body(env$fun1)[-5]
  "one"
}
fun1()
#> [1] "one"
body(fun1)
#> {
#>     1
#>     env <- environment(fun1)
#>     body(env$fun1) <- body(env$fun1)[-5]
#> }

Within a function, I'm removing the last line of code in that function
(string "one") and what happens here is that when I use this function
(first time), that string is actually returned, so this line of code
which is removed is executed. I don't have a good background in
computer science and would like to know why this last line of code is
executed. Why not - well, I could imagine that when the function is
called, it is executed line by line (of course), so before the last
line ("one"), this line will be removed and this string won't be
returned. However, when Bert mentioned functional paradigm, I have
started to think that it may looks like this:
a) function is defined
b) function is called and in the one before last line of code, some
object (fun1) is modified and when something is modified, the copy is
made, so the modified function lives in a different memory address.
c) the original function (not changed) continues computation and
returns the string
d) when the execution is finished, then the modified fun1 is bind to
the name "fun1" and because this happens in the same environment where
the original fun1 was defined and the objects are now different,
garbage collector removes original (not modified) fun1 object.

Is that, more or less, what happens?

Best,

Grzegorz

This is not as complicated as you think.

## First define the function.
> fun1 <- function() {
    1
    env <- environment(fun1)
    body(env$fun1) <- body(env$fun1)[-5]
    "one"
 }

## The function as defined above is now in the environment in which it
was defined, here .GlobalRnv.

## Now calling it executes **the above function.**
> fun1()
[1] "one"

## But this execution has the side effect of modifying the function
object in .GlobalEnv. (This is why side effects can be problematic).
So when we look at fun1 again in that environment, we see the modified
version.

> fun1
function ()
{
    1
    env <- environment(fun1)
    body(env$fun1) <- body(env$fun1)[-5]
}

## which, of course, returns nothing on being called.
> fun1()

Subject: [R] Unexpected behavior in par()
Message-ID: <ec4aa4b3-1b4c-8272-96d3-b0dde00af5d0@sapo.pt>

Hello,

I have a function using base graphics that changes some graphics 
parameters, then plots what it has to plot, then on exit puts the 
graphics parameters back as they were.
The problem is that if outside the function the graphics parameters are 
also changed, for instance mfrow, those chages are not respected by the 
function. This seems to come from the way the graphics pars are saved.

After par(mfrow = c(2, 1))

- if I call par(no.readonly = TRUE) then the second call to the function 
plots in the 1st row, it overplots what was plotted before.
- if I save the pars when they are changed, all is well.

Here is a reproducible example.


f <- function(x, ...) {
   old_par <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)    # this is the problem
   par(mar = c(4.1, 3.1, 3.1, 1.1))      # or maybe here
   on.exit(par(old_par))
   barplot(x, ...)
}

g <- function(x, ...) {
   old_par <- par(mar = c(4.1, 3.1, 3.1, 1.1))   # this is the solution
   on.exit(par(old_par))
   barplot(x, ...)
}

set.seed(2022)
b1 <- table(sample(4, 100, TRUE))
b2 <- table(sample(10, 100, TRUE))

# 1st function, unexpected behavior
old_par <- par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
f(b1, main = "1st plot")
f(b2, main = "2nd plot")
par(old_par)

# 2nd function, all is well
old_par <- par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
g(b1, main = "1st plot")
g(b2, main = "2nd plot")
par(old_par)


If I print(old_par) in any of the functions the result is the right 
mfrow setting, so I would expect the 2nd call to f() to plot in the 2nd 
row. But it doesn't.
Function f() calls par() twice but it only changes a parameter unrelated 
to the parameter set outside the function.

I'm obviously making a mistake but I don't know what. Is this expected 
(or a par() bug)?


Thaks in advance,

Rui Barradas

par("mfrow") works by updating par("fig") before each plot.  I think that
when you reset all the par values after each plot you reset par("fig") to
the value it had before you made the last plot.

Lybrya,

You might have better luck on SEMNET. Responses won't necessarily be
specific to R, but that's where to find a concentration of experts on
factor analysis in a variety of contexts.

You have to have a LISTSERV account to log in, but you can follow this link
to both set up an account and then subscribe to the list.

hi!  after loading the survey library, i believe you might want to create a
`svrepdesign()` object that matches the SAS syntax published here?

https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsls09/pdf/2011328_1.pdf#page=174

...not sure if you need combined.weights = FALSE option added to the
svrepdesign() call, but it looks like your complex survey design should
look roughly like this?

hsls09_design <- svrepdesign( data = data_frame_with_hsls09 , type="BRR",
weights = ~w1student , repweights="w1student[0-9]+" )

from there, you could look to the examples posted on the ?svyfactanal help
page and use your design=hsls09_design rather than the example dataset
design=dclus1

Hello,

Thanks, that makes sense. So don't use par(no.readonly = TRUE) unless 
that's the desired behavior.

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] Nmix package - Bayesian inference about univariate
 Gaussian mixtures with an unknown number of components
Message-ID: <d52bf841-0a15-ba10-6585-155a33be35e9@bristol.ac.uk>

This package is now on CRAN in version 2.0.2, and anyone interested in 
inference on mixture models, or more generally in Bayesian inference for 
"trans-dimensional" problems, is encouraged to try it out. The 
methodology is that presented by Richardson and Green in our 1997 
article in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, using 
Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo. The package is based on the 
Fortran code used in the research for that paper, which is available now 
to the R user for the first time. A rich variety of outputs from the 
MCMC sample path is available, optionally, and many features of the 
posterior distribution are presented graphically. Apart from its direct 
use in analysing data, the package might be useful in supporting 
learning about Bayesian computation.

Feedback is most welcome, and I may be open to extending the 
functionality of the package in response to concrete suggestions.

regards,

Peter Green

Hello,

There's a graphics parameter for aspect ratio that you can set asp=1 on 
a plot by plot basis. But you also need to change pty. From ?par:

pty
A character specifying the type of plot region to be used; "s" generates 
a square plotting region and "m" generates the maximal plotting region.



old_par <- par(pty = "s")
plot(1, asp = 1)
par(old_par)


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

... and following up on Rui's reply, assuming that the default (in R,
not RStudio) "m" is being used, I would assume that the aspect ratio
in the RStudio device depends on the layout of your windows. Also, you
might do better asking here, https://community.rstudio.com/ , than on
this list.

Making a new plot with par(mfrow=...) or par(mfcol=...) in effect also
updates par("mfg"), which describes where in the array of plots you are.
If you overwrite that with its previous value then you will overlay the new
plot on top of the previous one.

Subject: [R] binom.test & p-value
Message-ID: <bd4b57e5-2f91-9b11-ce04-50cadc8293d8@wiwi.hu-berlin.de>

Hi,

for the specific example binom.test(x=6, n=26, p=0.1) I get as p-value 
0.03986. The default approach to decide whether I can reject the null or 
or not is to compare the p-value with the given significance level. 
Using a significance level of 0.05 this will lead to reject the null 
hypothesis.

However, computing things by hand it turned out that the critical values 
are 0 and 6. Since the test statistic is also 6 I can not reject the 
null hypothesis.

I found the discussion under 
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2009-February/380341.html and I 
understand that a p-value is not well defined if we have a asymmmetric 
(discrete) distribution under the null.

At least I would have expected some hint in the documentation for 
binom.test.

Hello,

Can you post your computations? Assuming a two-sided test, mine are


x <- 6
n <- 26
p <- 0.1

cmb <- sapply(x:n, \(i) choose(n, i))
sum(cmb * p^(x:n) * (1 - p)^(n - (x:n)))
#[1] 0.03985931

binom.test(x=6, n=26, p=0.1)$p.value
#[1] 0.03985931


The result are equal to one another.

Hi Nick,
If you can bear using R base graphics, the plotrix package has a
function named "getYmult" that allows you to adjust for the aspect
ratio of any plot area.

plot.window() (hence the default plot()) has an 'asp' argument that sets
the ratio of the y and x scales.
E.g.,
   par(mfrow=c(3,1))
   plot( 1i ^ (0:4), type="l")
   plot( 1i ^ (0:4), type="l", asp=1)
   plot( 1i ^ (0:4), type="l", asp=0.5)

https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsls09/pdf/2011328_1.pdf#page=174<https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnces.ed.gov%2Fsurveys%2Fhsls09%2Fpdf%2F2011328_1.pdf%23page%3D174&data=04%7C01%7CLybrya.Kebreab%40ucf.edu%7C5e98bbea7fef4b603c7a08da14e56257%7Cbb932f15ef3842ba91fcf3c59d5dd1f1%7C0%7C1%7C637845272695458770%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=3lwAHPrQyr2PkOWXRiyDadxRoRLLub7hC4%2FYRG61RmQ%3D&reserved=0>

...not sure if you need combined.weights = FALSE option added to the svrepdesign() call, but it looks like your complex survey design should look roughly like this?

hsls09_design <- svrepdesign( data = data_frame_with_hsls09 , type="BRR", weights = ~w1student , repweights="w1student[0-9]+" )

from there, you could look to the examples posted on the ?svyfactanal help page and use your design=hsls09_design rather than the example dataset design=dclus1

Hi there,

I am finally getting to some material I had problems with in university,
where I was introduced to R - one of those that because of time
constraints, I had challenges figuring out, particularly because I decided
long ago on using Fedora Linux. The book, "Understanding Statistics Using
R" by Andy Field et. al., says to install ggplot2 into R and the version of
R that the dnf command installs will neigher install this package nor
'scales'. The result I get is below, and I attempted installing the
packages via the tar command, and that neither worked, and I attempted
library("ggplot2") and R said the package was unavailable. What can I do to
move forward?

Thanks,

Richard

You need to learn regular expression patterns... there are lots of languages that use them, and tutorial websites that teach them to you. They are not the same as filename globbing patterns, and list.files uses regex because they are much more flexible.

Here is an example:

list.files( pattern = "[135]\\.csv$" )

Hi,

the lower critical value is zero since:

 > cbind(0:2, pbinom(0:2, 26, 0.1))

      [,1]       [,2]

[1,]    0 0.06461082

[2,]    1 0.25126430

[3,]    2 0.51050524

the upper critical value c_u=6 since:

 > cbind(5:7, pbinom((5:7), 26, 0.1))

      [,1]      [,2]

[1,]    5 0.9601407

[2,]    6 0.9881313

[3,]    7 0.9970172

with F(c_u)>=0.975 and F(c_u-1)<0.975 .

Thus,

* x=6 is in [0,6] => can not reject null
* p-value 0.03985 < 0.05 => reject null

Hi Bill,
getYmult allows the user to draw a circle, square, etc. regardless of
whether the distortion is due to the plot aspect ratio or different x
and y ranges. It's handy when explicitly drawing regular geometric
figures on an existing plot.

No, there is NO lower critical value at 0.05 level since already P(X<=0) > .05. 

The basic issue here (generic to all two-sided 1 dimensional "exact" tests) is how to compute the rejection region. 

The version used by R is to count into the total p-value all points with a lower point probability than the one observed. So for X=6, we do

 > dbinom(0:26,26,.1)
 [1] 6.461082e-02 1.866535e-01 2.592409e-01 2.304364e-01 1.472232e-01
 [6] 7.197581e-02 2.799059e-02 8.885903e-03 2.344891e-03 5.210869e-04
[11] 9.842752e-05 1.590748e-05 2.209372e-06 2.643693e-07 2.727620e-08
[16] 2.424551e-09 1.852087e-10 1.210515e-11 6.725082e-13 3.146237e-14
[21] 1.223537e-15 3.884243e-17 9.808695e-19 1.895400e-20 2.632500e-22
[26] 2.340000e-24 1.000000e-26
> dbin <- dbinom(0:26,26,.1)
> dbin[7]
[1] 0.02799059
> sum(dbin[7:27])
[1] 0.03985931
> dbin < dbin[7]
 [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
[13]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
[25]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
> sum(dbin[dbin<=dbin[7]])
[1] 0.03985931

Notice that all points with lower dbin are to the right of X==6. For X==5 we get

> dbin < dbin[6]
 [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
[13]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
[25]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
> sum(dbin[dbin<=dbin[6]])
[1] 0.1764459

so now we do count the point mass at X==0, but the total p-value is not < .05

Similarly, we do not reject if X==0
> sum(dbin[dbin<=dbin[1]])
[1] 0.1044701

where as we obviously rejece for any X>6. So we end up with a one-sided rejection region for any alpha value < .1045.

This is not uncontroversial, some may want to construct the test as two 1-sided test at half the significance level. 
In that case, P(X>=6) > .025 and no rejection at .05 level.
 
This approach has the benefit of being consistent with confidence interval calculations, but it does not generalize to multidimensional cases like fisher.test() on a 3x2 table.

install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

An alternative
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

The first only installs ggplot2. The alternative installs a bunch of other stuff as well.

[External Email]

Hi there,

I am finally getting to some material I had problems with in university, where I was introduced to R - one of those that because of time constraints, I had challenges figuring out, particularly because I decided long ago on using Fedora Linux. The book, "Understanding Statistics Using R" by Andy Field et. al., says to install ggplot2 into R and the version of R that the dnf command installs will neigher install this package nor 'scales'. The result I get is below, and I attempted installing the packages via the tar command, and that neither worked, and I attempted
library("ggplot2") and R said the package was unavailable. What can I do to move forward?

Thanks,

Richard

Hi,

Beyond the clear COI, allow me to suggest RadViz3D for fully three-dimensional radial visualization, which as pointed out by a reviewer, is ideal for proportions data.

The paper is here:

Fully Three-Dimensional Radial Visualization by Yifan Zhu, Fan Dai, and
Ranjan Maitra Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics. 2022,
https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2021.2020129

The R package is on github: https://github.com/fanne-stat/radviz3d

Best wishes,
Ranjan

Subject: [R] complicated time series filtering issue
Message-ID: <SA1PR09MB753614942CE63B4AE4E8081FD9E59@SA1PR09MB7536.namprd09.prod.outlook.com>

Hello:  I have an issue with filtering in a time series of animal growth data that seems conceptually simple but I have not come up with effective code to implement this.  I have temporal sequences of lengths by individuals and I want to retain only those data that are >10 days apart sequentially within an individuals records.  I can readily compute intervals between successive dates by individual using data.table() and its by = INDIVIDUAL functionality.  See example data for one individual below.  But what currently eludes me in processing this is how to recognize for example that deleting the 2nd and 3rd rows is required because the totality of their time interval is 9 days, deleting 8th record with 4 days is required,  deleting 17th record with 1 day is required, deleting 22nd and 23rd records is required because their sum is 2 days, but we do not delete 24th record of 10 days because the sum of previous 2 records deleted and this one is now 12 days.  Each individual can have very different patterns of these sort of sequences.  These sequences are easy to look at and determine what needs to be done but writing effective code to accomplish this filtering seems to require some functionality that I am currently missing.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

winnow <- function(x, int=5){
   keep <- x[1]
   remaining <- x[-1]
   while (length(remaining))
   {
      nxt <- tail(keep,1) + int

}

I think the idea is more 
for (i in 2:nrow(x)){
ifelse(x[i]-x[i-1] >10) {keep x[i], delete x[i]]
}

I am not quite clear on the correct code for "keep" or "delete."

One could try 
for (i in 2:nrow(x)){
x$new[i] <- x[i]-x[i-1]

x <- x %>% filter(new>=10)

This only works if consecutive sample dates are 10 or more days apart. You could add an else if that would accumulate days, and if successful reset the clock.

Like this?

winnow <- function(x, int=5){
   keep <- x[1]
   remaining <- x[-1]
   while (length(remaining))
   {
      nxt <- tail(keep,1) + int
      if(length(remaining) ==1 ||
         all(remaining < nxt))break
      remaining <- remaining[remaining >tail(keep,1) + int]
      keep <- c(keep,remaining[1])
   }
   keep
}

> x
 [1]  1  2  5  7  8  9 15 16 17 19 20 21 28 35 37 41 43 45 46 50

i would guess, that's where you need to investigate, figure out why the
install didn't work.  one *possible* reason is that R is trying to
install the libraries to the system-wide library directory, and you
don't have permission to install there.  but, there are a multitude of
other possible failures.

you might start by this: are you able to install other packages?  if
not, you should look in one direction; if so, in another.

sadly, i don't know what that means.

good luck with the debugging!

cheers, Greg

Depending on your OS, there might be a better chance of success with


install.packages("ggplot2", dependencies=TRUE)

The Linux install process doesn't need this but the binary install on MacOS or Windows may need this to prevent the sort of error message that was offered.

The book, "Understanding Statistics Using R" by Andy Field et. al., says to install ggplot2 into R and the version of R that the dnf command installs will neigher install this package nor 'scales'. The result I get is below, and I attempted installing the packages via the tar command, and that neither worked, and I attempted
