Subject: [R] Identify first row of each ID within a data frame,
 create a variable first =1 for the first row and first=0 of all
 other rows
Message-ID: <DM6PR03MB5049ED4EE95641C693B3D7EAE2342@DM6PR03MB5049.namprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Dear R help folks,

First my apologizes for sending several related questions to the list server. I am trying to learn how to manipulate data in R . . . and am having difficulty getting my program to work. I greatly appreciate the help and support list member give!

I am trying to write a program that will run through a data frame organized by ID and for the first line of each new group of data lines that has the same ID create a new variable first that will be 1 for the first line of the group and 0 for all other lines.

e.g. if my original data is 
 olddata
   ID date
    1     1
    1     1
    1     2
    1     2
    1     3
    1     3
    1     4
    1     4
    1     5
    1     5
    2     5
    2     5
    2     5
    2     6
    2     6
    2     6
    3   10
    3   10

the new data will be
newdata
   ID date  first
    1     1       1
    1     1       0
    1     2       0
    1     2       0
    1     3       0
    1     3       0
    1     4       0
    1     4       0
    1     5       0
    1     5       0
    2     5       1
    2     5       0
    2     5       0
    2     6       0
    2     6       0
    2     6       0
    3   10       1
    3   10       0

When I run the program below, I receive the following error:
Error in df[, "ID"] : incorrect number of dimensions

My code:
# Create data.frame
ID <- c(rep(1,10),rep(2,6),rep(3,2))
date <- c(rep(1,2),rep(2,2),rep(3,2),rep(4,2),rep(5,2),
          rep(5,3),rep(6,3),rep(10,2))
olddata <- data.frame(ID=ID,date=date)
class(olddata)
cat("This is the original data frame","\n")
print(olddata)
 
# This function is supposed to identify the first row 
# within each level of ID and, for the first row, set
# the variable first to 1, and for all rows other than
# the first row set first to 0.
mydoit <- function(df){
  value <- ifelse (first(df[,"ID"]),1,0)
  cat("value=",value,"\n")
  df[,"first"] <- value
}
newdata <- aggregate(olddata,list(olddata[,"ID"]),mydoit)

Thank you,
John

I think as.numeric(! duplicated(group)) might do this for you ...

Personally, I'd do this in the tidyverse with dplyr and its row_number()
function.

olddata %>% group_by(ID) %>% mutate(first = as.integer(row_number() == 1))

May I ask *why* you want to do this?

It sounds to me like like you're using SAS-like strategies for your
data analysis rather than R-like.

I was wondering along similar lines, Bert.

One way to get help is to ask how to do some single step of a larger strategy. That can lead to answers that may not be as applicable to the scenario.

Another way would be to include a synopsis of what they are trying to do.

But, as John says he is trying to learn and improve his abilities, perhaps he s getting what he wants.
After watching some of the exchanges in multiple questions, many seem to revolve around a wish to deal with sorted grouped data. He seems to have looked at some base R methods as well as packages like dplyr using tibbles as well as another package and format.

What interests me from a dplyr perspective is how many little embedded functions it makes available and some have been mentioned here. If you want to  add a column that contains the same value for each group, such as the minimum, mean, first and many other things, it is very easily doable.

The latest request seems to be a bit different as it wants a column with a 1 (presumably for TRUE) only for the first entry in  the group. Again, fairly easy using one of several hooks such as the rownumber being "1" versus not. There are many variations on the answer supplied depending on style and need, such as making a column that contains the row number, and in a later step, set those to zero that are not a one. 

But sometimes you want to ask what the overall algorithm is. Do you need extra columns to then use for some purpose, or could that purpose have been done another way such as doing some calculation only when rownumber is one.

As noted, R makes some operations fairly natural, in ways that differ from the "natural" way another program/environment does it. Sometimes a translation is not worth doing as compared to a reworked algorithm that makes good use of whichever package and related functionality you want to use. 

Assuming all these questions relate to the same project, I am not clear if and where the lookback at previous row/value fits.

Of course, John may not be free to share more in public.

Anyone want to suggest a book or two on data processing of this sort using R that might illustrate with examples galore on how various problems are solved and then perhaps some will be similar enough ...

May I ask *why* you want to do this?

It sounds to me like like you're using SAS-like strategies for your
data analysis rather than R-like.

Hello,

And here are two other solutions.


olddata$first <- with(olddata, ave(seq_along(ID), ID, FUN = \(x) x == 
x[1L]))

olddata$first <- c(1L, diff(olddata$ID))


Of these two, diff is faster. But of all the solutions posted so far, 
Ben Bolker's is the fastest. And it can be made a little faster if 
as.integer substitutes for as.numeric.
And dplyr::mutate now has a .by argument, which avoids explicit the call 
to group_by, with a performance gain.


library(microbenchmark)

mb <- microbenchmark(
   ave = with(olddata, ave(seq_along(ID), ID, FUN = \(x) x == x[1L])),
   dup_num = as.numeric(! duplicated(olddata$ID)),
   dup_int = as.integer(! duplicated(olddata$ID)),
   diff = diff = c(1L, diff(olddata$ID)),
   dplyr_grp = olddata %>% group_by(ID) %>% mutate(first = 
as.integer(row_number() == 1)),
   dplyr = olddata %>% mutate(first = as.integer(row_number() == 1), .by 
= ID)
)
print(mb, order = "median")



However, note that dplyr operates in entire data.frames and therefore is 
expected to be slower when tested against instructions that process one 
column only.


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Hello,


"Why does output stats vary in decimal places even when options 
(digits=3) were set?"

Yes, they do but shouldn't they? I'm seeing all numbers with 3 digits. 
Display digits and rounding are not the same thing.

Also, you don't need to load the package to have access to one of its 
data sets,


data(energy, package = "ISwR")


will load it. In this case, it's probably even better, "energy" is not 
an uncommon source for data and there might be data sets with the same 
name in other packages.


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

"f these two, diff is faster. But of all the solutions posted so far,
Ben Bolker's is the fastest."

But the explicit version of diff is still considerably faster:

OK.

(Note: I am ccing this to the list so that others can correct any
mistakes, misunderstandings, or misstatements that I may make; and
also give you more and better advice about how to proceed. For
example, there may be environmental packages ( see the environmetrics
task view, https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=Environmetrics) that
already do everything you want from your data source that someone else
could tell you about. Why reinvent the wheel if you don't have to? )

Unfortunately, you failed to show us the critical information
necessary to give you a definitive answer: the structure of a single
record. However, I will wing it based on your description and assume
that each record contains the following information something like
this: Latitude   Longitude  Date Time pm25 + other stuff maybe.  If
this is the case,

1) You do not need to sort anything. R has robust date-time
manipulation and computation capabilities to handle dates and times,
though in this case you only need dates. R knows all about how to
order dates and times.

2) You do not have to physically group your records according to
geographic location. R knows how to extract and manipulate groups
without this;

3) And as all you need is a daily average, you do not need to worry
about when days begin or end.

If this is a reasonably accurate interpretation of what needs to be
done, and your data are in a data frame called dat, then something
like the following will do it:
## First convert latitude and longitude into a single location factor, loc
dat$loc <- with(dat, paste0(Latitude, Longitude))

## you could also convert the latitude and longitude into actual
location names if you like; the "factor" data structure in R is one
simple way to do this, for example.

## Then a one liner in base R does what I think you want:
avgs <- aggregate(pm25 ~ loc + Date, FUN = mean, data = dat)

See ?aggregate for details. Note in particular that you can get
results simultaneously for several different pm's or whatevers. I
should also note that the so-called "Tidyverse" and "data.table"
groups of packages, and likely others, also can easily do these sorts
of things, though of course with different syntax, semantics, and
functionality, perhaps in ways that you might find simpler to master..
There are many good tutorials available for both base R and these
packages, but from my ignorant perspective, you need to first spend
some time to learn about R's basic data structures (factors, lists,
vectors, etc.) if you want to use R for serious data manipulation.
Finally, my best advice would be to forget about SAS if you wish to
use R. Trying to translate SAS paradigms into R is the devil's work.

Cheers,
Bert

John,

Thanks for enlightening us so we better understand.

I won't argue with your wish to learn to do things in base R first. I started that way, myself, and found lots of the commands not particularly easy to fit into a single worldview. Many functions I read about were promptly forgotten, especially those without great documentation and not enough examples of real world usage.

This is why some packages that came later are important as they generally try to come up with a somewhat consistent set of tools that often are also faster and more flexible. There is often a set of reasons various packages are created in the first place to meet real needs. And, I note that some may be subtle. Original R was often inconsistent in the order of command arguments while the dplyr and other tidyverse command try as much as possible to make the first argument be the one normally passed through a pipeline. R fairly recently added a native pipe operator that may be faster than the magrittr pipe but in some ways makes some functionality harder. The rest of R has not really been changed to make using commands in pipelines easy.

You seem to have also looked at data.table and given you may have large amounts of data, it may be designed in ways that might also be beneficial.

But as I do not want to relearn lots of R functions I never use, I will bow out from further discussion as what I would offer these days would probably not be what you want.

My personal opinion is that proper use of R can actually be far easier and more flexible than you had with the proprietary software that may largely consist of canned reports often used.

I do want to point out a few things to consider.

When you go grouping, you may want to consider grouping (as well as sorting) by multipole variables. You mention a variable with about 500 possibilities and then another variable with an ID number but did not say the ID number was unique across them all. 

And, I want to note you may want to also look into testing the sanity of your data. That is a wide area too. Things like duplicates, for example.

I do not know how many steps you can handle but there are sometimes designs that make an algorithm work differently.

Consider your request to find  the first row in each grouping and add a column with a 1, and 0 for all others. If that is what you need, fine.

But, what if instead you just added a row number. Some rows would have a 1, and some may have a 2, 3, or 4.

When you wanted  to so something to just the rows with a 1, you can filter out a subset of the data easily enough or apply a command only to those rows. But if you want to test if any entry has more than 4 rows, this could allow you to detect an error. Other ideas might be possible if that is how the data was saved.

And, if it really is a 0/1 choice, fine, but consider the advantages or disadvantages of what you save in the new column. Storing a numeric or an int can take up space when storing a Boolean or TRUE/FALSE is what you need. R gives you lots of flexibility which perhaps you did not have to think about before.

All I know is that so much of what you want to do is easily enough done with a pipeline or two in dplyr. But this is your task and you choose what makes sense. It specializes in group analysis and generates reports and so on. It may not be how you think.

Subject: Re: [R] Identify first row of each ID within a data frame, create a variable first =1 for the first row and first=0 of all other rows

Dear Colleagues,

I am grateful to all of you for helping me with my question, how to write R code that will identify the first row of each ID within a data frame, create a variable first=1 for the first row and first=0 for all repeats of the ID.

WOW!!!
I just saw Boris Steipe's answer to my question:
olddata$first <- as.numeric(! duplicated(olddata$ID))
The solution is elegant, short, easy to understand, and it uses base R! All important characteristics of a good solution, at least for me. While I want to learn solutions using packages that extend base R, I believe that a good programmer learns how to do something using the base language and once that is learned, explores way to solve a programing problem using advanced packages.

Each and every one of you (I hope I did not miss anyone in my list of email addresses) took the time to read my emails and respond to me. Your collective help is invaluable, and I am in your collect debt.

Many, many thanks,
John

Dear Colleagues,

I am grateful to all of you for helping me with my question, how to write R code that will identify the first row of each ID within a data frame, create a variable first=1 for the first row and first=0 for all repeats of the ID.

WOW!!!
I just saw Boris Steipe's answer to my question:
olddata$first <- as.numeric(! duplicated(olddata$ID))
The solution is elegant, short, easy to understand, and it uses base R! All important characteristics of a good solution, at least for me. While I want to learn solutions using packages that extend base R, I believe that a good programmer learns how to do something using the base language and once that is learned, explores way to solve a programing problem using advanced packages.

Each and every one of you (I hope I did not miss anyone in my list of email addresses) took the time to read my emails and respond to me. Your collective help is invaluable, and I am in your collect debt.

Many, many thanks,
John

Subject: [R] Undocumented behaviour of diag when replacing the diagonal of a
 matrix?
Message-ID: <982a9d37-0f89-42bc-9394-69f8080bf227@math.uni-giessen.de>

Dear list,

is anyone aware of the following behavious of diag when used to replace 
diagonals (plural!) of a matrix?

Small example: The following is documented and clearly to be expected:

A <- matrix(0, nrow = 5, ncol = 5)
diag(A) <- 1; A


BUT, what about the following? When executing the code of `diag<-` line 
by line, it throws errors. So why does it work?

diag(A[-1, ]) <- 2; A

diag(A[-5, -1]) <- 3; A

diag(A[-5, -(1:2)]) <- 4; A


Any ideas?

  TIA and best regards  --  Gerrit

matrices are vectors with a "dim" attribute.
So what I think is happening is:

> A <- matrix(1:25, nrow = 5, ncol = 5)
> diag(A[-1,]) <- 0
> A
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1    6   11   16   21
[2,]    0    7   12   17   22
[3,]    3    0   13   18   23
[4,]    4    9    0   19   24
[5,]    5   10   15    0   25

     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]

[3,]    3    0   13   18   23
[4,]    4    9    0   19   24
[5,]    5   10   15    0   25

I didn't check, but I assume your other examples would work similarly.
Please repost if I am wrong.

Could you show us the log of what you did that generated errors?  The 
statement `diag(A[-1, ]) <- 2` is pretty complex; it involves two 
assignment functions (both `diag<-` and `[<-`), so you might have tried 
to execute the wrong thing.

Hi Hasan,

Thank you for the advice.  What does that mean by "respond with the output
of `dput(nyc_ct_geo)`"?  Please provide more details to address the
problem.  Thank you!

Hi, Bert,

thx, but I don't think so, because your example fails, if you use
different entries for matrix A than your vector 1:25. (Try A filled with 
only zeroes, e.g.)

I guess, Duncan Murdochs hint is crucial. I'll comment on his asap.

Hi, Duncan,

thx for your valuable hint re the two assigment functions! That might be 
the reason. Nevertheless, I couldn't figure out how they work together 
here. I simply executed the relevant lines of code which I found in 
`diag<-`body after assigning the matrix to x (which, of course, cannot 
yield the same as diag(A[-1,]) <- 7 in the light of your explanation):

A <- matrix(0, nrow = 5, ncol = 5)

x <- A[-1,]
value <- 7


# From `diag<-`'s body:

dx <- dim(x)
len.i <- min(dx)
len.v <- length(value)
if (len.i) {
   i <- seq_len(len.i)
   x[cbind(i, i)] <- value
   }
x



I fiddled a bit around with expressions, but to no avail.
Could you (or anybody else) maybe still shed some more light on this?
Thx a lot in advance!

  Best  --  Gerrit

As Hasan suggested, much more information is needed. It would be very helpful to know the class of nyc_ct_geo, and how it was created. It is possibly an sf object from the print output. 

>From this, assuming that it is an sf object, the geometries are polygons, not points, so need to be converted to text, best WKT (well-known text) to write to CSV. It is then best to use the appropriate function from sf with a CSV driver - minimal example:

library(sf)
nc <- st_read(system.file("gpkg/nc.gpkg", package="sf"))
tf <- tempfile(fileext=".csv")
st_write(nc_geom, tf, driver="CSV", layer_options=c("GEOMETRY=AS_WKT"))
file.show(tf)

With more than 2000 polygon objects in your case, this is hardly a sensible way to write geometries to file, and depends on the person receiving the file having software that can convert WKT back to geometries. For more details on the CSV driver for st_write, please see https://gdal.org/en/stable/drivers/vector/csv.html#vector-csv

Maybe following up on the R-sig-geo list would be helpful if clarification is needed.

YOU'VE MISUNDERSTOOD Bert's reply: A matrix is a vector, and Bert 
assigned the indices of the vector to the cells of the matrix.

	  "if you use different entries for matrix A", the entries are no 
longer the indices of A as a vector.


	  Does this fact make his example work for you?


	  It does for me.
	  Hope this helps.

 Undocumented behaviour of diag when replacing the diagonal of a

Gerrit:
Oh, sorry. I was obviously unclear. What I meant by "equivalent" was
"this is how the subset of indices in A whose corresponding values are
changed is selected."  So the example was meant to show this, not as a
literal representation of the code.

This might be a clearer explanation, but feel free to ignore and
certainly no need to reply.

A <- matrix(0, nrow =5, ncol = 5)

Here is what  "diag(A[-1,] <- 1" does (semantically):
B <- A[-1,]
diag(B) <- 1
A[-1,] <- B  ## etc. for all your examples

This makes semantic sense to me, i.e. what you want "diag(A[-1,] <- 1"
to mean. This puzzled me, but maybe you understood this already and
just wanted to understand how the code does this. If so, my apologies
for the spam.

Cheers,
Bert

What have you tried? How good do you know R?
R contains many functions to read input.

Carlos you are gonna have to provide at least a tiny smidge of information

Reagent dataset? What is this?

What is your problem with creating a script in R Studio. File New..

It kinda feels this is either "how do I use R studio" (in which case
YouTube feels your friend) or "how do I use some very specific package
which I am going to forget to tell you"

I am trying to use ggplot2 to create a figure with multiple lines, one line for each value of the variable Day. Each group of data for Day requires seven lines. The dataframe has data for 4 days and thus 4*7=28 lines.

I can create a plot, but the plot only contains dots. The dots for each day should be connected each day's data by a different line. There should be a total of four lines on the graph 

mydata <-structure(list(Day = c("25", "25", "25", "25", "25", "25", "25", 
                       "26", "26", "26", "26", "26", "26", "26", "27", "27", "27", "27", 
                       "27", "27", "27", "28", "28", "28", "28", "28", "28", "28"), 
               AQIGroup = structure(c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 5L, 6L, 7L, 1L, 2L,

John,

I hate to break it to you that ggplot2 is not part of base R. "plot" and
maybe lattice qualify.

But I can work with you. Try this:

ggplot(data=mydata, 
       aes(x=AQIGroup,
           y=Freq,
           group=Day,
           color=Day)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()

The main change besides naming arguments for clarity, is adding what it
should be grouped by. I believe you want it grouped by day, but am not
totally sure except that the grouping was not done by your last line that
sort of changed the x,y back to what it would be anyway.

What exactly is stopping you, Carlos?

Do you know where the reagent dataset is? I don't. Is it being loaded from a
known format like a .CSV file, or part of an EXCEL spreadsheet and so on?

Does it come with a function in a package that you load and then invoke to
load it or make it visible? Or, should you already have copied it somewhere
on your disk? Depending on many scenarios, loading methods are available.

Moving on, if you read it in, often enough some columns are assigned a
different data type than you want. Some methods of reading in may allow you
to supply a list of hints as to what you want each column to be.

In any case, once you have read in the data, perhaps in the form of a
data.frame or tibble or other variants, you can generally execute commands
to replace a column with a transformation of your choice such as
as.integer() or convert it to a factor or even make new columns with other
visions of the original and so on.

Without some info on what you have tried and what failed, this is a very
basic request and chances are you won't get much help.

Hi there


I want to create a script in Rstudio and load in the reagent dataset
ensuring that the different data types in there (dates, text, etc) come
through correctly.

Best wishes

Carlos

This is off-topic for this list, but first use the file | import dataset 
menu.? Then go to the history tab, highlight the import statement that 
was generated and click to source.? You'll have to figure out where the 
reagent dataset is on your own.
