Subject: [R] weird things in seqMK() and sqmk()
Message-ID: <CABxY9BO-07koJ61186rLpDYWWLRSPRzGkTZbbJ8jzz8=KkY9mA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello  The other say I posted a question about altering confidence limits
in the seqMK() function  in the pheno package.  I didn't get any bites but
in any case I've been trying to use this function.  It seems to me to give
very odd results - sometimes identifying 8 or 9 changepoints in a
relatively short vector of maybe 40 elements, and at other times not giving
any changepoints at all, despite visually there appearing to be
changepoints and other changepoint algorithms (pettitt etc) saying that
there are other changepoints.  Apart from the cran vignette there doesn't
seem to be anything on this function

Has anyone else used the seqMK() function and if so, have they noticed any
weird behaviour with it?

I've also lookedf at sqmk() in trendchange function.  This also seems to
give odd results, and not ones consistent with seqMK() results either

Again has anyone used these and do they know of any sites with further ifo,
as it seems v sparse about these two functions
Thanks Nick Wray

There are references listed on the help page for seqMK.  I'd start with 
those.

If you can't figure it out from that, then contacting the pheno package 
maintainer or author of the package would probably be the best step. 
This group really isn't set up for supporting contributed packages, 
though sometimes knowledgeable people here will comment.

Dear Anas Jamshed,

This is a list for R, not for specific genomic question using R.

You will have more chance to have answers using a genomic list.

And when you ask question, it is better to not use abbreviation that 
only people from that field will understand: TMM ?

It's a microarray data set, so I don't think you would want to apply
an RNA-seq pipeline. You'd be better off applying a normalization
appropriate for this type of microarray data.

Message-ID: <66fec2cf-c0c9-d821-f32d-8b6222fc5be3@inserm.fr>

Hi,

Not important, but IMHO the estimate component of the t.test holds an 
estimate of mean of each group, never a difference. The doc says 
"estimate??? the estimated mean or difference in means depending on 
whether it was a one-sample test or a two-sample test."

 > t.test(0:4)$estimate
mean of x
 ??????? 2
 > t.test(0:4, 5:9)$estimate
mean of x mean of y
 ??????? 2???????? 7

Best,
Samuel

Hi

You need to use paired option

mean difference
             -5

Dear Nick,

Looking at dput(pheno::seqMK), 
dput(pheno::tau), and [1], I think you 
need to change the function pheno::tau 
to change the confidence level ... R

Hallo, 
you are probably right that 

"the estimated mean or difference in means depending on whether it was a one-sample test or a two-sample test"

should be rephrased to

"the estimated mean or difference in means depending on whether it was a one-sample test, two-sample test or two sample paired test"

Message-ID: <CH2PR13MB36401FC1C56E179305968591FA929@CH2PR13MB3640.namprd13.prod.outlook.com>

Hi R-Helpers,

Sorry to bother you, but I have a simple task that I can't figure out how to do.

For example, I have some names in two columns

NamesWide<-data.frame(Name1=c("Tom","Dick"),Name2=c("Larry","Curly"))

and I simply want to get a single column
NamesLong<-data.frame(Names=c("Tom","Dick","Larry","Curly"))
> NamesLong
  Names
1   Tom
2  Dick
3 Larry
4 Curly


Stack produces an error
NamesLong<-stack(NamesWide$Name1,NamesWide$Names2)
Error in if (drop) { : argument is of length zero

So does bind_rows
> NamesLong<-dplyr::bind_rows(NamesWide$Name1,NamesWide$Name2)
Error in `dplyr::bind_rows()`:
! Argument 1 must be a data frame or a named atomic vector.
Run `rlang::last_error()` to see where the error occurred.

I tried making separate dataframes to get around the error in bind_rows but it puts the data in two different columns
Name1<-data.frame(c("Tom","Dick"))
Name2<-data.frame(c("Larry","Curly"))
NamesLong<-dplyr::bind_rows(Name1,Name2)
> NamesLong
  c..Tom....Dick.. c..Larry....Curly..
1              Tom                <NA>
2             Dick                <NA>
3             <NA>               Larry
4             <NA>               Curly

gather makes no change to the data
NamesLong<-gather(NamesWide,Name1,Name2)
> NamesLong
  Name1 Name2
1   Tom Larry
2  Dick Curly


Please help me solve what should be a very simple problem.

Thanks,
John Sparks

Hi,

You were on the right track using stack(), but you just pass the entire data frame as a single object, not the separate columns:

> stack(NamesWide)
? values ? ind
1 ? ?Tom Name1
2 ? Dick Name1
3 ?Larry Name2
4 ?Curly Name2

Note that stack also returns the index (second column of 'ind' values), which tells you which column in the source data frame the stacked values originated from.

Thus, if you just want the actual data:

> stack(NamesWide)$values
[1] "Tom" ? "Dick" ?"Larry" "Curly"

returns a vector, or:

> stack(NamesWide)[, 1, drop = FALSE]
? values
1 ? ?Tom
2 ? Dick
3 ?Larry
4 ?Curly

which returns a data frame with a single column named 'values'.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

My first thought was pivot_longer, and stack() is new to me. 
How about append(c1,c2) as another solution? Or data.frame(append(c1,c2)) if you want that form.

Hi

Thanks for your feedback. I didn't think about that.

Still, the mean difference is computed for paired, not because there are 
two samples. IMHO, the help should be updated.

Best,
Samuel

IMHO The difference makes sense for paired samples. For unpaired samples it is just the difference in means. I think presenting the means (and assuming the audience can perform subtraction) conveys more information. The interpretation of a difference of 5 might be influenced if I have means of -3, 2, or 4, 9, or 2000, 2005.

Why not:

NamesWide <- data.frame(Name1=c("Tom","Dick"),Name2=c("Larry","Curly"))
NamesLong <- data.frame(Names=with(NamesWide, c(Name1, Name2)))

I may be missing something but using the plain old c() combine function
seems to work fine:

df <- data.frame(left = 1:5, right = 6:10)
df.combined <- data.frame(comb = c(df$left, df$right))

df
  left right
1    1     6
2    2     7
3    3     8
4    4     9
5    5    10

df.combined
   comb
1     1
2     2
3     3

5     5

Combined, the answers are close to an example in the documentation for microbenchmark where they (in part) look at execution times for c() versus append(). Here is the code, but c() has the shortest execution time in this example. If I remove a3 and a4 then c() is significantly shorter than append().

install.packages('microbenchmark')
library(microbenchmark)
c1 <- c("Lilia","Sam")
c2 <- c("Skywalker","Voldemort")
res <- microbenchmark(a1 <- c(c1, c2),
                      a2 <- append(c1, c2),
                      a3 <- {c3 <- data.frame(Name1=c1, Name2=c2)
                        stack(c3)},
                      a4 <- {c3 <- data.frame(Name1=c1, Name2=c2)
                        data.frame(Names=with(c3, c(Name1, Name2)))},
                      times=100L)
print(res)

Hi,

or maybe this?

NamesLong<-data.frame(Names=unlist(NamesWide), row.names = NULL)

HTH,

Just to repeat:
you have

   NamesWide<-data.frame(Name1=c("Tom","Dick"),Name2=c("Larry","Curly"))

and you want

   NamesLong<-data.frame(Names=c("Tom","Dick","Larry","Curly"))

There must be something I am missing, because

   NamesLong <- data.frame(Names = c(NamesWide$Name1, NamesWide$Name2))

appears to do the job in the simplest possible manner.  There are all sorts
of alternatives, such as
   data.frame(Name = as.vector(as.matrix(NamesWide[, 1:2])))

As for stack(), the main problem there was a typo (Names2 for Name2).

  values   ind
1    Tom Name1
2   Dick Name1

If there were multiple columns, you might do

[1] "Tom"   "Dick"  "Larry" "Curly"

Originally this post was to just look at execution times for different approaches to solving this problem.
Now I have a question:
   I change the code for calculating a1 from c(c1, c2) to data.frame(c(c1,c2)). This changes the execution times of all the other variables. What am I missing?

Original
For efficiency, the answer Avi provided is still the best option with these data. The append() method is next. Both of these approaches avoid having to make a data frame in the wide format. The slowest method is pivot_longer(). Note that the order of elements is different in the pivot_longer() approach. If the order matters then some of these answers will need sorting to get the correct output. Also note that a1 and a2 are vectors, while the others are data frames. However, all of these appear correct from our understanding of the problem.

library(tidyverse)
library(microbenchmark)
c1 <- c("Tom","Dick")
c2 <- c("Larry","Curly")
res <- microbenchmark(a1 <- c(c1, c2),
                      a2 <- append(c1, c2),
                      a3 <- {c3 <- data.frame(Name1=c1, Name2=c2)
                        stack(c3)},
                      a4 <- {c3 <- data.frame(Name1=c1, Name2=c2)
                        data.frame(Names=with(c3, c(Name1, Name2)))},
                      a5 <- {c3 <- data.frame(Name1=c1, Name2=c2)
                        data.frame(Names=unlist(c3), row.names=NULL)},
                      a6 <- {c3 <- data.frame(Name1=c1, Name2=c2)
                        pivot_longer(c3, cols=everything(),names_to="Names")},
                      a7 <- {c3 <- data.frame(Name1=c1, Name2=c2)
                        data.frame(Names=c(c3$Name1,c3$Name2))},
                      times=100L)
print(res)

Mean execution times for seven different methods where a1 <- c(c1,c2)
Method	Mean(ms)  	CLD
a1		1998    		a  
a2		5749    		a

Dear Members,
                             I have the following code typed at the console prompt:

y   <-   x*10

X has not been defined and the above code throws an object not found error. That is, the global environment does not contain x. Why doesn't it look further in the environment stack, like that of packages? There are thousands of packages that contain the variable named  x. Of course, that happens if the above code is in a function (or does it?).

What concept of R is at work in this dichotomy?

THanking you,
Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

Namespaces. Packages only export specific object names from their namespaces. But few instances of x would be found there.

Also, function argument lists are not added to the search path until the functions are running, and then the search path only goes through the environments in which the running functions were defined, not through the call stack.

First, some background:

Packages are associated with multiple environments.  There is the 
internal one that the package sees, and the external one that contains 
just the exports.

These are sometimes called the "package" environment and the "namespace" 
environment, but I don't think those names are used consistently. 
(There's another one containing the imports, but for these purposes, 
it's indistinguishable from the internal one.)

When a package is loaded by loadNamespace("pkg"), nothing happens in the 
global environment:  no new variables are visible.

When it is attached by library("pkg"), a lot more happens.  First, it is 
loaded as above, then the search list is modified.  The global 
environment is entry 1 in the search list; it stays there, but its 
"parent" is set to a copy of the external environment from the new 
package, and the parent of that environment is set to the previous 
parent, the second entry in the search list.

Okay, so now you search for "x" in the global environment, and it's not 
there.  It then goes to the other entries in the search list, which are 
typically external environments from various packages.  None of those 
packages export "x", so it is not found.

It doesn't matter if those packages use "x" without exporting it, 
because R won't look at internal environments in this kind of search.

And it doesn't matter what happens in other packages that are not on the 
search list (i.e. not "attached" because you never called library() or 
require() on them), because they just aren't in the chain of 
environments where R looks.

That is not the correct interpretation of the error. R will happily evaluate

y   <-   pi*10

even if the global environment does not contain pi. The "environments"
where R will look is given by

search()

If you manage to find a package that defines 'x' (and exports it),
attaching it will put the package on the search path, and then your call
will indeed no longer give an error.

Dear Deepayan,
                              THanks for the pithy, pointed reply.

But isn't it risky? Can I somehow get a warning when x is not defined in the global environment but takes on a value from one of the loaded packages? any packages for that?

THanking you,
Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

Dear Duncan,
                         THanks for the reply.

I am looking at the technical point. The behavior you just described, as far as I know, is only for functions right? THre is no documentation ever, which says that the code looks for x in the search path. Could you please point me to some resources where I can find further information on lexical scoping for the code "typed" in the console (but not in a function)?

THanking you,
Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

No, not at all.  Every function you write in R has an associated 
environment (which you can find using environment(fn)).  That only 
applies to searches taking place while evaluating the function.  The 
starting point is a temporary environment to hold local variables, 
called the "evaluation frame".  The parent of that environment is the 
environment given by environment(fn).

When you type something at the top level, evaluation is done very 
similarly, except that the starting point for the search is the global 
environment.

See section 3.5.1 in the R Language Definition for a description of the 
relation between the global environment and the search list.  See 
section 2.1.10 in that manual for how R looks up variables.

No, not at all.  Every function you write in R has an associated
environment (which you can find using environment(fn)).  That only
applies to searches taking place while evaluating the function.  The
starting point is a temporary environment to hold local variables,
called the "evaluation frame".  The parent of that environment is the
environment given by environment(fn).

When you type something at the top level, evaluation is done very
similarly, except that the starting point for the search is the global
environment.

See section 3.5.1 in the R Language Definition for a description of the
relation between the global environment and the search list.  See
section 2.1.10 in that manual for how R looks up variables.

You can't change the basic way R searches, but you can ask for a 
different kind of search.  For example, to see if "x" exists, you can use

  exists("x")

and it will do the default search, but

  exists("x", inherits = FALSE)

will only look in the current environment.  The get() function has a 
similar argument which returns the value

Unfortunately these functions have overly complicated argument lists 
because they are based on functions in S from 30-40 years ago, and it 
had very different scoping rules.  My advice would be to ignore the 
"where" and "frame" arguments, and always use "envir" if you want to say 
where to look.

Dear Duncan,
                         THanks for the reply...!

So the takeaway is that define the symbol in the same environment before using it right!?

Thanking you,
Yours sincerely,

No, there are lots of situations where that doesn't make sense.  You 
don't want to have to define local copies of the functions from every 
package you use, for example.

I think the takeaway is to learn how R scoping works, and keep things 
simple.  That's one reason I tend to avoid "tidyverse" packages.  There 
are a lot of really good ideas in those packages, but "tidy evaluation" 
is far too complicated and hard to understand, and I think it confuses 
people, so they don't understand the really very simple R scoping rules.

simple.  That's one reason I tend to avoid "tidyverse" packages.  There
are a lot of really good ideas in those packages, but "tidy evaluation"
is far too complicated and hard to understand, and I think it confuses
people, so they don't understand the really very simple R scoping rules.

The following *might* be of use to you. If you can predict what the various
function invocations will do, I think you have a reasonable grasp of how
lexical scoping works in R (contrary or supplementary opinions welcome).
It is the sort of thing you will find in the references also. If this is
all obvious, sorry for wasting your time.

Leading off with you can only have two things in an environment definitely indicates this should be read with a skeptical eye.

Although the title of "Advanced R" may be more scary than someone writing notes on GitHub like a bro, IMHO Adv R is quite readable for anyone interested in questions like this with fewer wrong assertions to unlearn later.

R *does* search the environment stack.

> search()
[1] ".GlobalEnv"        "package:stats"     "package:graphics"
[4] "package:grDevices" "package:utils"     "package:datasets"
[7] "package:methods"   "Autoloads"         "package:base

What you seem to be missing is that a package may contain
bindings that it does not export, as the wording of this
error message reminds us:
> utils::y
Error: 'y' is not an exported object from 'namespace:utils'

So when package/namespace goes onto the environment stack,
it's only the *exported* bindings that become visible.

It seems mostly correct. Here are a few quibbles:

- I don't think "owner" is a good description of the parent environment. 
  Usually when I use owner in computing, there's an implication that the 
owner controls what it owns, is responsible for allocating and 
destroying it, etc.  Parent environments are targets of a pointer from 
other environments that list them as their "enclosure", but they have no 
record of their children.

- The analogy that all roads lead to the search list is wrong.  There's 
no reason you couldn't create an environment whose parent was the empty 
environment.  But with the qualifier "when we start in R_GlobalEnv" it's 
correct, so this complaint is just about the wording.

- The description of what Imports does is wrong.  What is described 
there is what the `import()` directive in NAMESPACE does.  The Imports 
line in DESCRIPTION just guarantees that the named package is loaded, it 
doesn't import anything.  And the `importFrom()` directive in NAMESPACE 
isn't discussed.

- It gets bad near the end in the "Curveball" section.  I'd just skip 
that.  It's not at all true that all functions in a package have the 
package's namespace environment as their environment.  There are lots of 
real examples where that's not true.  Functions that maintain persistent 
records (e.g. the base function conflictRules()) often have a private 
environment, and occasionally packages import functions from other 
packages by simple assignment, so they end up in the namespace 
environment of the importer but still have the namespace environment of 
the exporter associated with them.  And the last diagram (the revised 
one with all solid lines) is just misleading.

Hi Duncan. I read it a looooong time ago so it's probably best if
I read it again ALONG with your corrections. Every detail matters
with these concepts so thanks a lot.

The following *might* be of use to you. If you can predict what the various function invocations will do, I think you have a reasonable grasp of how lexical scoping works in R (contrary or supplementary opinions welcome).  It is the sort of thing you will find in the references also. If this is all obvious, sorry for wasting your time.

R *does* search the environment stack.

> search()
[1] ".GlobalEnv"        "package:stats"     "package:graphics"
[4] "package:grDevices" "package:utils"     "package:datasets"
[7] "package:methods"   "Autoloads"         "package:base

What you seem to be missing is that a package may contain
bindings that it does not export, as the wording of this
error message reminds us:
> utils::y
Error: 'y' is not an exported object from 'namespace:utils'

So when package/namespace goes onto the environment stack,
it's only the *exported* bindings that become visible.

Well, if you google that you should quickly be lead to
(something I even think makes sense to memorize as "rule"
  package=<pkg> ) :

  https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=prob

which now says that the package was archived as it depended on
another package that was archived.

Both are still there -- in the CRAN archive --
but to install them may be a bit of work particularly if you are
on Windows (as it suggeested you are via a Microsoft "add" at
the end of your R-help post ..).
One way I'd use is Winbuilder
(which will require you to set yourself as formal "Maintainer" of
 the package before submission).

An alternative may be to use Rhub ..
or then learn to do it yourself, by installing the "Rtools" (for Windows):
---> https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
 
With best regards,
Martin

I updated to latest RStudio (RStudio-2023.03.0-386.exe) but
R would not run. Error message:

The R session failed to start.

RSTUDIO VERSION

I also tried RStudio 2022.12.0+353 --- same problem.

I then tried another older version of RStudio (not sure version
as I changed file name by accident) and R ran.

Any clues? Please help. Thanks.

No, but you need to ask on an RStudio mailing list.
This one is about R.

Does R run from a command prompt?  If so, the problem is likely due to your
Rstudio setup.  If R does not run from a command prompt, any error messages
might give some idea of the problem.  I can run R and Rstudio in Windows
11?, Windows 10 and the current version of Linux Mint.

Just to be thorough, what version of R are you running.  RStudio is its
own project, and they have shifted their emphasis somewhat regarding R
somewhat.  The web site now states that the organization - now
called Posit - is not de-emphasizing R so much as extending to empbrase
Python.  The current version of RStudio requires R 3.3.0 or later.

Hello,

Do you have a file .RData in your home directory? If yes, try removing it.

As for not being able to read .R files, have you tried to right click 
and select a text processor to open them? Like this, you will probably 
be able to read the .R files.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

The RStudio list generally does not respond to free version users. I was hoping someone one this (R) list would be kind enough to help me.

The quality of RStudio has gone way downhill lately.  Although Posit is 
now a big company, I think there are only 1 or 2 people there who really 
know what's going on in the RStudio IDE, and they are busy on other 
things these days.

So my advice to you would be to switch to the Windows rgui front end 
(which comes with R, so questions about it will be addressed here), or 
switch to a different OS, or just stay with the old RStudio version that 
was working for you.

I don't think that is true. It is perhaps true that you cannot get 
personalized help from employed staff, but you can certainly submit to 
the Q&A forum.

Hello,

Yes it does.
I have asked questions before and got answers that solved my problems as

I suspect Martin is referring to the need to have an OS-specific 
toolchain for compiling packages. In this case however the DESCRIPTION 
files says:


NeedsCompilation: no


So it is probably a simple matter to install. Err.... not quite 
correctOr it would have been if there hadn't been several dependencies, 
some of which required compilation. Here's what finally worked on a 
machine that has a working toolchain.

install.packages("fBasics")

install.packages("http://cran.nexr.com/src/contrib/fOptions_3042.86.tar.gz", 
repo=NULL)

install.packages("http://cran.nexr.com/src/contrib/fAsianOptions_3042.82.tar.gz", 
repo=NULL)

install.packages("https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/prob/prob_1.0-1.tar.gz", 
repo=NULL)


I think I could have changed my repo to cran.nexr.com and they might 
have even had binaries. I'll check. Yep, they do have source and 
binaries. So that might be the easiest. You could try just this:


install.packages("fAsianOptions", repo="http://cran.nexr.com/", 
dependencies=TRUE)

I have also had difficulty running R in RStudio. Has anyone else had problems?
 It will be a shame if we need to abandon R Studio. It is a very good IDE.

I don't think that is true. It is perhaps true that you cannot get personalized help from employed staff, but you can certainly submit to the Q&A forum.

Any clues? Please help. Thanks.

R studio sometimes isn't happy with i386 versions. Although I thought they
had put support back in. If you have the option for 64bit, use 64bit R.

I've also had similar issues when R couldn't find the executable.

But absolutely would expect if you post this on the community forum someone
would be along to help.

Screenshots with setup etc will be helpful, which isn't visible on here...

Obviously running R is pretty fundamental to running R studio. So it seems
rather odd to be thinking you'd need to stop using R studio unless you are
doing something odd

I'm not aware of widespread problems, but it's possible that some
combination of OS, RStudio version, and R version might be causing
problems. Unfortunately I don't think there's enough information in
this thread for anyone to tell if that's the case.

Subject: [R] simultaneous confidence intervals for multinomial proportions:
 sample size
Message-ID: <1041153943.632748.1681037198192@email.df.eu>

Hello!
I want to calculate simultaneous confidence intervals for a nominal variable with three categories: "yes", "no", "partially" and I expect that far more than 5 samples fall into each category.
I have read that Glaz & Sison's method is only appropriate for variables with 7 or more categories. Therefore, the Goodman method seems like a good idea.
I have found the R function "MultinomCI" {DescTools} to calculate these CIs.
However, I have not found a way to calculate in advance the required sample size for the Goodman method at a fixed confidence level and length of the intervall.
I would be very grateful for any suggestion.


Many thanks in advance!

Claudia

Seems very unlikely that you can achieve both of those goals simultaneously. I would expect the CI width t vary with the size of the sample in each category in any case. So I'm wondering if your failure at searching derives from the impossibility of your goal. Why would you desire such a result?

Dear members,
                             I am extracting a pdf table by the following code:

> library(tabulizer)
> IDT <- extract_tables("https://www.canmoney.in/pdf/INTRADAYLEVERAGE-20220531-latest.pdf",output = "data.frame")

It returns 4 different data frames which I want to combine them and make one data frame. But when I run this:

> rbind(IDT[[1]],IDT[[2]],IDT[[3]],IDT[[4]])
 Error in match.names(clabs, names(xi)) :
names do not match previous names

Also:

> class(IDT[[1]])
[1] "data.frame"

> cbind(IDT[[1]],IDT[[2]],IDT[[3]],IDT[[4]],make.row.names = FALSE)
 Error in data.frame(..., check.names = FALSE) :
arguments imply differing number of rows: 55, 56, 30, 1

Can anyone please help me to combine all these 4 different data frames?

Thanking you,
Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

Clearly the column names are different. You need to decide what to do about that. Choose the subset of dataframes where the column names are the same? Rename columns? Omit some columns? Add missing columns filled with NA?

Sorry, did not read closely enough.

Did you want rbind (which has no problem with different numbers of rows) or merge (which requires that there be key columns that can be aligned by repeating data)?

Your code used cbind. My first answer was appropriate for rbind.

So you still need to figure out how to deal with the different columns in the tables, which requires more knowledge about their contents than we have.

Dear Jeff,
                  Thanks for your reply.

I have the following:

> colnames(IDT[[4]])
[1] "X168"                "TATA.MOTORS.LIMITED" "TATAMOTORS"          "X4"

THe above has to be the first row of IDT[[4]]. The first row is getting parsed as the column name. How do you make that the first row of IDT[[4]]?

Thanking you,
Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

I don't know... I have never used tabulizer (which is no longer on CRAN anyway).

In general you would provide an argument to the data import function that would tell it to expect a header. I suspect you will have to set the names(IDT[[4]]) <- whatever it should be and remove the first row from the data frame.

Dear Jeff,
                  Got the answer...I changed output = "matrix" in extract_table and used as.data.frame to coerce the output matrix to a data frame and
rbind is working fine then...

Thanks anyways for your reply...

THanking you,
Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

It says that nser requires the most recent version of magrittr that you do
not have installed. You must update magrittr before attempting to install
nser:

update.packages(oldPkgs = "magrittr")

or at the prompt you were presented before, choose to update magrittr
before installing nser.

Downloading package from url: https://cran.rstudio.com//src/contrib/Archive/nser/nser_1.4.0.tar.gz
These packages have more recent versions available.
It is recommended to update all of them.
Which would you like to update?

 1: All
 2: CRAN packages only
 3: None
 4: rlang    (1.0.4 -> 1.1.0 ) [CRAN]
 5: cli      (3.3.0 -> 3.6.1 ) [CRAN]
