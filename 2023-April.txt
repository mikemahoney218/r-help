Subject: [R] weird things in seqMK() and sqmk()
Message-ID: <CABxY9BO-07koJ61186rLpDYWWLRSPRzGkTZbbJ8jzz8=KkY9mA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello  The other say I posted a question about altering confidence limits
in the seqMK() function  in the pheno package.  I didn't get any bites but
in any case I've been trying to use this function.  It seems to me to give
very odd results - sometimes identifying 8 or 9 changepoints in a
relatively short vector of maybe 40 elements, and at other times not giving
any changepoints at all, despite visually there appearing to be
changepoints and other changepoint algorithms (pettitt etc) saying that
there are other changepoints.  Apart from the cran vignette there doesn't
seem to be anything on this function

Has anyone else used the seqMK() function and if so, have they noticed any
weird behaviour with it?

I've also lookedf at sqmk() in trendchange function.  This also seems to
give odd results, and not ones consistent with seqMK() results either

Again has anyone used these and do they know of any sites with further ifo,
as it seems v sparse about these two functions
Thanks Nick Wray

There are references listed on the help page for seqMK.  I'd start with 
those.

If you can't figure it out from that, then contacting the pheno package 
maintainer or author of the package would probably be the best step. 
This group really isn't set up for supporting contributed packages, 
though sometimes knowledgeable people here will comment.

Message-ID: <CAG0CrLgJ7sejknyeBm8SXVJ-13ZWGccMBYx4MiZQCKiiuUi_jw@mail.gmail.com>

I want to get the count matrix of genes from
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE146049. Is it
possible for GSE146049? After getting counts, I want to do TMM
normalization.

Dear Anas Jamshed,

This is a list for R, not for specific genomic question using R.

You will have more chance to have answers using a genomic list.

And when you ask question, it is better to not use abbreviation that 
only people from that field will understand: TMM ?

It's a microarray data set, so I don't think you would want to apply
an RNA-seq pipeline. You'd be better off applying a normalization
appropriate for this type of microarray data.

HTH,

How can I subscribe to R genomic list?
