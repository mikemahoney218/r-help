Subject: [R] weird things in seqMK() and sqmk()
Message-ID: <CABxY9BO-07koJ61186rLpDYWWLRSPRzGkTZbbJ8jzz8=KkY9mA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello  The other say I posted a question about altering confidence limits
in the seqMK() function  in the pheno package.  I didn't get any bites but
in any case I've been trying to use this function.  It seems to me to give
very odd results - sometimes identifying 8 or 9 changepoints in a
relatively short vector of maybe 40 elements, and at other times not giving
any changepoints at all, despite visually there appearing to be
changepoints and other changepoint algorithms (pettitt etc) saying that
there are other changepoints.  Apart from the cran vignette there doesn't
seem to be anything on this function

Has anyone else used the seqMK() function and if so, have they noticed any
weird behaviour with it?

I've also lookedf at sqmk() in trendchange function.  This also seems to
give odd results, and not ones consistent with seqMK() results either

Again has anyone used these and do they know of any sites with further ifo,
as it seems v sparse about these two functions
Thanks Nick Wray

There are references listed on the help page for seqMK.  I'd start with 
those.

If you can't figure it out from that, then contacting the pheno package 
maintainer or author of the package would probably be the best step. 
This group really isn't set up for supporting contributed packages, 
though sometimes knowledgeable people here will comment.

Dear Anas Jamshed,

This is a list for R, not for specific genomic question using R.

You will have more chance to have answers using a genomic list.

And when you ask question, it is better to not use abbreviation that 
only people from that field will understand: TMM ?

It's a microarray data set, so I don't think you would want to apply
an RNA-seq pipeline. You'd be better off applying a normalization
appropriate for this type of microarray data.

Message-ID: <66fec2cf-c0c9-d821-f32d-8b6222fc5be3@inserm.fr>

Hi,

Not important, but IMHO the estimate component of the t.test holds an 
estimate of mean of each group, never a difference. The doc says 
"estimate??? the estimated mean or difference in means depending on 
whether it was a one-sample test or a two-sample test."

 > t.test(0:4)$estimate
mean of x
 ??????? 2
 > t.test(0:4, 5:9)$estimate
mean of x mean of y
 ??????? 2???????? 7

Best,
Samuel

Hi

You need to use paired option

mean difference
             -5

Dear Nick,

Looking at dput(pheno::seqMK), 
dput(pheno::tau), and [1], I think you 
need to change the function pheno::tau 
to change the confidence level ... R

Hallo, 
you are probably right that 

"the estimated mean or difference in means depending on whether it was a one-sample test or a two-sample test"

should be rephrased to

"the estimated mean or difference in means depending on whether it was a one-sample test, two-sample test or two sample paired test"

Message-ID: <CH2PR13MB36401FC1C56E179305968591FA929@CH2PR13MB3640.namprd13.prod.outlook.com>

Hi R-Helpers,

Sorry to bother you, but I have a simple task that I can't figure out how to do.

For example, I have some names in two columns

NamesWide<-data.frame(Name1=c("Tom","Dick"),Name2=c("Larry","Curly"))

and I simply want to get a single column
NamesLong<-data.frame(Names=c("Tom","Dick","Larry","Curly"))
> NamesLong
  Names
1   Tom
2  Dick
3 Larry
4 Curly


Stack produces an error
NamesLong<-stack(NamesWide$Name1,NamesWide$Names2)
Error in if (drop) { : argument is of length zero

So does bind_rows
> NamesLong<-dplyr::bind_rows(NamesWide$Name1,NamesWide$Name2)
Error in `dplyr::bind_rows()`:
! Argument 1 must be a data frame or a named atomic vector.
Run `rlang::last_error()` to see where the error occurred.

I tried making separate dataframes to get around the error in bind_rows but it puts the data in two different columns
Name1<-data.frame(c("Tom","Dick"))
Name2<-data.frame(c("Larry","Curly"))
NamesLong<-dplyr::bind_rows(Name1,Name2)
> NamesLong
  c..Tom....Dick.. c..Larry....Curly..
1              Tom                <NA>
2             Dick                <NA>
3             <NA>               Larry
4             <NA>               Curly

gather makes no change to the data
NamesLong<-gather(NamesWide,Name1,Name2)
> NamesLong
  Name1 Name2
1   Tom Larry
2  Dick Curly


Please help me solve what should be a very simple problem.

Thanks,
John Sparks

Hi,

You were on the right track using stack(), but you just pass the entire data frame as a single object, not the separate columns:

> stack(NamesWide)
? values ? ind
1 ? ?Tom Name1
2 ? Dick Name1
3 ?Larry Name2
4 ?Curly Name2

Note that stack also returns the index (second column of 'ind' values), which tells you which column in the source data frame the stacked values originated from.

Thus, if you just want the actual data:

> stack(NamesWide)$values
[1] "Tom" ? "Dick" ?"Larry" "Curly"

returns a vector, or:

> stack(NamesWide)[, 1, drop = FALSE]
? values
1 ? ?Tom
2 ? Dick
3 ?Larry
4 ?Curly

which returns a data frame with a single column named 'values'.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

My first thought was pivot_longer, and stack() is new to me. 
How about append(c1,c2) as another solution? Or data.frame(append(c1,c2)) if you want that form.

Hi

Thanks for your feedback. I didn't think about that.

Still, the mean difference is computed for paired, not because there are 
two samples. IMHO, the help should be updated.

Best,
Samuel

IMHO The difference makes sense for paired samples. For unpaired samples it is just the difference in means. I think presenting the means (and assuming the audience can perform subtraction) conveys more information. The interpretation of a difference of 5 might be influenced if I have means of -3, 2, or 4, 9, or 2000, 2005.

Why not:

NamesWide <- data.frame(Name1=c("Tom","Dick"),Name2=c("Larry","Curly"))
NamesLong <- data.frame(Names=with(NamesWide, c(Name1, Name2)))

I may be missing something but using the plain old c() combine function
seems to work fine:

df <- data.frame(left = 1:5, right = 6:10)
df.combined <- data.frame(comb = c(df$left, df$right))

df
  left right
1    1     6
2    2     7
3    3     8
4    4     9
5    5    10

df.combined
   comb
1     1
2     2
3     3

5     5

Combined, the answers are close to an example in the documentation for microbenchmark where they (in part) look at execution times for c() versus append(). Here is the code, but c() has the shortest execution time in this example. If I remove a3 and a4 then c() is significantly shorter than append().

install.packages('microbenchmark')
library(microbenchmark)
c1 <- c("Lilia","Sam")
c2 <- c("Skywalker","Voldemort")
res <- microbenchmark(a1 <- c(c1, c2),
                      a2 <- append(c1, c2),
                      a3 <- {c3 <- data.frame(Name1=c1, Name2=c2)
                        stack(c3)},
                      a4 <- {c3 <- data.frame(Name1=c1, Name2=c2)
                        data.frame(Names=with(c3, c(Name1, Name2)))},
                      times=100L)
print(res)

Hi,

or maybe this?

NamesLong<-data.frame(Names=unlist(NamesWide), row.names = NULL)

HTH,

Just to repeat:
you have

   NamesWide<-data.frame(Name1=c("Tom","Dick"),Name2=c("Larry","Curly"))

and you want

   NamesLong<-data.frame(Names=c("Tom","Dick","Larry","Curly"))

There must be something I am missing, because

   NamesLong <- data.frame(Names = c(NamesWide$Name1, NamesWide$Name2))

appears to do the job in the simplest possible manner.  There are all sorts
of alternatives, such as
   data.frame(Name = as.vector(as.matrix(NamesWide[, 1:2])))

As for stack(), the main problem there was a typo (Names2 for Name2).

  values   ind
1    Tom Name1
2   Dick Name1

If there were multiple columns, you might do

[1] "Tom"   "Dick"  "Larry" "Curly"

Originally this post was to just look at execution times for different approaches to solving this problem.
Now I have a question:
   I change the code for calculating a1 from c(c1, c2) to data.frame(c(c1,c2)). This changes the execution times of all the other variables. What am I missing?

Original
For efficiency, the answer Avi provided is still the best option with these data. The append() method is next. Both of these approaches avoid having to make a data frame in the wide format. The slowest method is pivot_longer(). Note that the order of elements is different in the pivot_longer() approach. If the order matters then some of these answers will need sorting to get the correct output. Also note that a1 and a2 are vectors, while the others are data frames. However, all of these appear correct from our understanding of the problem.

library(tidyverse)
library(microbenchmark)
c1 <- c("Tom","Dick")
c2 <- c("Larry","Curly")
res <- microbenchmark(a1 <- c(c1, c2),
                      a2 <- append(c1, c2),
                      a3 <- {c3 <- data.frame(Name1=c1, Name2=c2)
                        stack(c3)},
                      a4 <- {c3 <- data.frame(Name1=c1, Name2=c2)
                        data.frame(Names=with(c3, c(Name1, Name2)))},
                      a5 <- {c3 <- data.frame(Name1=c1, Name2=c2)
                        data.frame(Names=unlist(c3), row.names=NULL)},
                      a6 <- {c3 <- data.frame(Name1=c1, Name2=c2)
                        pivot_longer(c3, cols=everything(),names_to="Names")},
                      a7 <- {c3 <- data.frame(Name1=c1, Name2=c2)
                        data.frame(Names=c(c3$Name1,c3$Name2))},
                      times=100L)
print(res)

Mean execution times for seven different methods where a1 <- c(c1,c2)
Method	Mean(ms)  	CLD
a1		1998    		a  
a2		5749    		a

Dear Members,
                             I have the following code typed at the console prompt:

y   <-   x*10

X has not been defined and the above code throws an object not found error. That is, the global environment does not contain x. Why doesn't it look further in the environment stack, like that of packages? There are thousands of packages that contain the variable named  x. Of course, that happens if the above code is in a function (or does it?).

What concept of R is at work in this dichotomy?

THanking you,
Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

Namespaces. Packages only export specific object names from their namespaces. But few instances of x would be found there.

Also, function argument lists are not added to the search path until the functions are running, and then the search path only goes through the environments in which the running functions were defined, not through the call stack.

First, some background:

Packages are associated with multiple environments.  There is the 
internal one that the package sees, and the external one that contains 
just the exports.

These are sometimes called the "package" environment and the "namespace" 
environment, but I don't think those names are used consistently. 
(There's another one containing the imports, but for these purposes, 
it's indistinguishable from the internal one.)

When a package is loaded by loadNamespace("pkg"), nothing happens in the 
global environment:  no new variables are visible.

When it is attached by library("pkg"), a lot more happens.  First, it is 
loaded as above, then the search list is modified.  The global 
environment is entry 1 in the search list; it stays there, but its 
"parent" is set to a copy of the external environment from the new 
package, and the parent of that environment is set to the previous 
parent, the second entry in the search list.

Okay, so now you search for "x" in the global environment, and it's not 
there.  It then goes to the other entries in the search list, which are 
typically external environments from various packages.  None of those 
packages export "x", so it is not found.

It doesn't matter if those packages use "x" without exporting it, 
because R won't look at internal environments in this kind of search.

And it doesn't matter what happens in other packages that are not on the 
search list (i.e. not "attached" because you never called library() or 
require() on them), because they just aren't in the chain of 
environments where R looks.

That is not the correct interpretation of the error. R will happily evaluate

y   <-   pi*10

even if the global environment does not contain pi. The "environments"
where R will look is given by

search()

If you manage to find a package that defines 'x' (and exports it),
attaching it will put the package on the search path, and then your call
will indeed no longer give an error.

Dear Deepayan,
                              THanks for the pithy, pointed reply.

But isn't it risky? Can I somehow get a warning when x is not defined in the global environment but takes on a value from one of the loaded packages? any packages for that?

THanking you,
Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

Dear Duncan,
                         THanks for the reply.

I am looking at the technical point. The behavior you just described, as far as I know, is only for functions right? THre is no documentation ever, which says that the code looks for x in the search path. Could you please point me to some resources where I can find further information on lexical scoping for the code "typed" in the console (but not in a function)?

THanking you,
Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

No, not at all.  Every function you write in R has an associated 
environment (which you can find using environment(fn)).  That only 
applies to searches taking place while evaluating the function.  The 
starting point is a temporary environment to hold local variables, 
called the "evaluation frame".  The parent of that environment is the 
environment given by environment(fn).

When you type something at the top level, evaluation is done very 
similarly, except that the starting point for the search is the global 
environment.

See section 3.5.1 in the R Language Definition for a description of the 
relation between the global environment and the search list.  See 
section 2.1.10 in that manual for how R looks up variables.

No, not at all.  Every function you write in R has an associated
environment (which you can find using environment(fn)).  That only
applies to searches taking place while evaluating the function.  The
starting point is a temporary environment to hold local variables,
called the "evaluation frame".  The parent of that environment is the
environment given by environment(fn).

When you type something at the top level, evaluation is done very
similarly, except that the starting point for the search is the global
environment.

See section 3.5.1 in the R Language Definition for a description of the
relation between the global environment and the search list.  See
section 2.1.10 in that manual for how R looks up variables.

You can't change the basic way R searches, but you can ask for a 
different kind of search.  For example, to see if "x" exists, you can use

  exists("x")

and it will do the default search, but

  exists("x", inherits = FALSE)

will only look in the current environment.  The get() function has a 
similar argument which returns the value

Unfortunately these functions have overly complicated argument lists 
because they are based on functions in S from 30-40 years ago, and it 
had very different scoping rules.  My advice would be to ignore the 
"where" and "frame" arguments, and always use "envir" if you want to say 
where to look.

Dear Duncan,
                         THanks for the reply...!

So the takeaway is that define the symbol in the same environment before using it right!?

Thanking you,
Yours sincerely,

No, there are lots of situations where that doesn't make sense.  You 
don't want to have to define local copies of the functions from every 
package you use, for example.

I think the takeaway is to learn how R scoping works, and keep things 
simple.  That's one reason I tend to avoid "tidyverse" packages.  There 
are a lot of really good ideas in those packages, but "tidy evaluation" 
is far too complicated and hard to understand, and I think it confuses 
people, so they don't understand the really very simple R scoping rules.

simple.  That's one reason I tend to avoid "tidyverse" packages.  There
are a lot of really good ideas in those packages, but "tidy evaluation"
is far too complicated and hard to understand, and I think it confuses
people, so they don't understand the really very simple R scoping rules.

The following *might* be of use to you. If you can predict what the various
function invocations will do, I think you have a reasonable grasp of how
lexical scoping works in R (contrary or supplementary opinions welcome).
It is the sort of thing you will find in the references also. If this is
all obvious, sorry for wasting your time.

Leading off with you can only have two things in an environment definitely indicates this should be read with a skeptical eye.

Although the title of "Advanced R" may be more scary than someone writing notes on GitHub like a bro, IMHO Adv R is quite readable for anyone interested in questions like this with fewer wrong assertions to unlearn later.

R *does* search the environment stack.

> search()
[1] ".GlobalEnv"        "package:stats"     "package:graphics"
[4] "package:grDevices" "package:utils"     "package:datasets"
[7] "package:methods"   "Autoloads"         "package:base

What you seem to be missing is that a package may contain
bindings that it does not export, as the wording of this
error message reminds us:
> utils::y
Error: 'y' is not an exported object from 'namespace:utils'

So when package/namespace goes onto the environment stack,
it's only the *exported* bindings that become visible.

It seems mostly correct. Here are a few quibbles:

- I don't think "owner" is a good description of the parent environment. 
  Usually when I use owner in computing, there's an implication that the 
owner controls what it owns, is responsible for allocating and 
destroying it, etc.  Parent environments are targets of a pointer from 
other environments that list them as their "enclosure", but they have no 
record of their children.

- The analogy that all roads lead to the search list is wrong.  There's 
no reason you couldn't create an environment whose parent was the empty 
environment.  But with the qualifier "when we start in R_GlobalEnv" it's 
correct, so this complaint is just about the wording.

- The description of what Imports does is wrong.  What is described 
there is what the `import()` directive in NAMESPACE does.  The Imports 
line in DESCRIPTION just guarantees that the named package is loaded, it 
doesn't import anything.  And the `importFrom()` directive in NAMESPACE 
isn't discussed.

- It gets bad near the end in the "Curveball" section.  I'd just skip 
that.  It's not at all true that all functions in a package have the 
package's namespace environment as their environment.  There are lots of 
real examples where that's not true.  Functions that maintain persistent 
records (e.g. the base function conflictRules()) often have a private 
environment, and occasionally packages import functions from other 
packages by simple assignment, so they end up in the namespace 
environment of the importer but still have the namespace environment of 
the exporter associated with them.  And the last diagram (the revised 
one with all solid lines) is just misleading.

Hi Duncan. I read it a looooong time ago so it's probably best if
I read it again ALONG with your corrections. Every detail matters
with these concepts so thanks a lot.

The following *might* be of use to you. If you can predict what the various function invocations will do, I think you have a reasonable grasp of how lexical scoping works in R (contrary or supplementary opinions welcome).  It is the sort of thing you will find in the references also. If this is all obvious, sorry for wasting your time.

R *does* search the environment stack.

> search()
[1] ".GlobalEnv"        "package:stats"     "package:graphics"
[4] "package:grDevices" "package:utils"     "package:datasets"
[7] "package:methods"   "Autoloads"         "package:base

What you seem to be missing is that a package may contain
bindings that it does not export, as the wording of this
error message reminds us:
> utils::y
Error: 'y' is not an exported object from 'namespace:utils'

So when package/namespace goes onto the environment stack,
it's only the *exported* bindings that become visible.

Well, if you google that you should quickly be lead to
(something I even think makes sense to memorize as "rule"
  package=<pkg> ) :

  https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=prob

which now says that the package was archived as it depended on
another package that was archived.

Both are still there -- in the CRAN archive --
but to install them may be a bit of work particularly if you are
on Windows (as it suggeested you are via a Microsoft "add" at
the end of your R-help post ..).
One way I'd use is Winbuilder
(which will require you to set yourself as formal "Maintainer" of
 the package before submission).

An alternative may be to use Rhub ..
or then learn to do it yourself, by installing the "Rtools" (for Windows):
---> https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
 
With best regards,
Martin

I updated to latest RStudio (RStudio-2023.03.0-386.exe) but
R would not run. Error message:

The R session failed to start.

RSTUDIO VERSION

I also tried RStudio 2022.12.0+353 --- same problem.

I then tried another older version of RStudio (not sure version
as I changed file name by accident) and R ran.

Any clues? Please help. Thanks.

No, but you need to ask on an RStudio mailing list.
This one is about R.

Does R run from a command prompt?  If so, the problem is likely due to your
Rstudio setup.  If R does not run from a command prompt, any error messages
might give some idea of the problem.  I can run R and Rstudio in Windows
11?, Windows 10 and the current version of Linux Mint.

Just to be thorough, what version of R are you running.  RStudio is its
own project, and they have shifted their emphasis somewhat regarding R
somewhat.  The web site now states that the organization - now
called Posit - is not de-emphasizing R so much as extending to empbrase
Python.  The current version of RStudio requires R 3.3.0 or later.

Hello,

Do you have a file .RData in your home directory? If yes, try removing it.

As for not being able to read .R files, have you tried to right click 
and select a text processor to open them? Like this, you will probably 
be able to read the .R files.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

The RStudio list generally does not respond to free version users. I was hoping someone one this (R) list would be kind enough to help me.

The quality of RStudio has gone way downhill lately.  Although Posit is 
now a big company, I think there are only 1 or 2 people there who really 
know what's going on in the RStudio IDE, and they are busy on other 
things these days.

So my advice to you would be to switch to the Windows rgui front end 
(which comes with R, so questions about it will be addressed here), or 
switch to a different OS, or just stay with the old RStudio version that 
was working for you.

I don't think that is true. It is perhaps true that you cannot get 
personalized help from employed staff, but you can certainly submit to 
the Q&A forum.

Hello,

Yes it does.
I have asked questions before and got answers that solved my problems as

I suspect Martin is referring to the need to have an OS-specific 
toolchain for compiling packages. In this case however the DESCRIPTION 
files says:


NeedsCompilation: no


So it is probably a simple matter to install. Err.... not quite 
correctOr it would have been if there hadn't been several dependencies, 
some of which required compilation. Here's what finally worked on a 
machine that has a working toolchain.

install.packages("fBasics")

install.packages("http://cran.nexr.com/src/contrib/fOptions_3042.86.tar.gz", 
repo=NULL)

install.packages("http://cran.nexr.com/src/contrib/fAsianOptions_3042.82.tar.gz", 
repo=NULL)

install.packages("https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/prob/prob_1.0-1.tar.gz", 
repo=NULL)


I think I could have changed my repo to cran.nexr.com and they might 
have even had binaries. I'll check. Yep, they do have source and 
binaries. So that might be the easiest. You could try just this:


install.packages("fAsianOptions", repo="http://cran.nexr.com/", 
dependencies=TRUE)

I have also had difficulty running R in RStudio. Has anyone else had problems?
 It will be a shame if we need to abandon R Studio. It is a very good IDE.

I don't think that is true. It is perhaps true that you cannot get personalized help from employed staff, but you can certainly submit to the Q&A forum.

Any clues? Please help. Thanks.

R studio sometimes isn't happy with i386 versions. Although I thought they
had put support back in. If you have the option for 64bit, use 64bit R.

I've also had similar issues when R couldn't find the executable.

But absolutely would expect if you post this on the community forum someone
would be along to help.

Screenshots with setup etc will be helpful, which isn't visible on here...

Obviously running R is pretty fundamental to running R studio. So it seems
rather odd to be thinking you'd need to stop using R studio unless you are
doing something odd

I'm not aware of widespread problems, but it's possible that some
combination of OS, RStudio version, and R version might be causing
problems. Unfortunately I don't think there's enough information in
this thread for anyone to tell if that's the case.

Subject: [R] simultaneous confidence intervals for multinomial proportions:
 sample size
Message-ID: <1041153943.632748.1681037198192@email.df.eu>

Hello!
I want to calculate simultaneous confidence intervals for a nominal variable with three categories: "yes", "no", "partially" and I expect that far more than 5 samples fall into each category.
I have read that Glaz & Sison's method is only appropriate for variables with 7 or more categories. Therefore, the Goodman method seems like a good idea.
I have found the R function "MultinomCI" {DescTools} to calculate these CIs.
However, I have not found a way to calculate in advance the required sample size for the Goodman method at a fixed confidence level and length of the intervall.
I would be very grateful for any suggestion.


Many thanks in advance!

Claudia

Seems very unlikely that you can achieve both of those goals simultaneously. I would expect the CI width t vary with the size of the sample in each category in any case. So I'm wondering if your failure at searching derives from the impossibility of your goal. Why would you desire such a result?

Dear members,
                             I am extracting a pdf table by the following code:

> library(tabulizer)
> IDT <- extract_tables("https://www.canmoney.in/pdf/INTRADAYLEVERAGE-20220531-latest.pdf",output = "data.frame")

It returns 4 different data frames which I want to combine them and make one data frame. But when I run this:

> rbind(IDT[[1]],IDT[[2]],IDT[[3]],IDT[[4]])
 Error in match.names(clabs, names(xi)) :
names do not match previous names

Also:

> class(IDT[[1]])
[1] "data.frame"

> cbind(IDT[[1]],IDT[[2]],IDT[[3]],IDT[[4]],make.row.names = FALSE)
 Error in data.frame(..., check.names = FALSE) :
arguments imply differing number of rows: 55, 56, 30, 1

Can anyone please help me to combine all these 4 different data frames?

Thanking you,
Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

Clearly the column names are different. You need to decide what to do about that. Choose the subset of dataframes where the column names are the same? Rename columns? Omit some columns? Add missing columns filled with NA?

Sorry, did not read closely enough.

Did you want rbind (which has no problem with different numbers of rows) or merge (which requires that there be key columns that can be aligned by repeating data)?

Your code used cbind. My first answer was appropriate for rbind.

So you still need to figure out how to deal with the different columns in the tables, which requires more knowledge about their contents than we have.

Dear Jeff,
                  Thanks for your reply.

I have the following:

> colnames(IDT[[4]])
[1] "X168"                "TATA.MOTORS.LIMITED" "TATAMOTORS"          "X4"

THe above has to be the first row of IDT[[4]]. The first row is getting parsed as the column name. How do you make that the first row of IDT[[4]]?

Thanking you,
Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

I don't know... I have never used tabulizer (which is no longer on CRAN anyway).

In general you would provide an argument to the data import function that would tell it to expect a header. I suspect you will have to set the names(IDT[[4]]) <- whatever it should be and remove the first row from the data frame.

Dear Jeff,
                  Got the answer...I changed output = "matrix" in extract_table and used as.data.frame to coerce the output matrix to a data frame and
rbind is working fine then...

Thanks anyways for your reply...

THanking you,
Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

It says that nser requires the most recent version of magrittr that you do
not have installed. You must update magrittr before attempting to install
nser:

update.packages(oldPkgs = "magrittr")

or at the prompt you were presented before, choose to update magrittr
before installing nser.

Message-ID: <6253c881-857b-bc97-2420-d612a3549a3e@reclus2.nhh.no>

The third report on the R-spatial evolution project has been published.

https://r-spatial.org/r/2023/04/10/evolution3.html

It links back to earlier blogs and presentations, and focuses on work that 
maintainers of R packages and workflows using rgdal, rgeos and maptools 
need to put in train now before the packages are archived on CRAN.

The first changes will occur in June 2023, and the retiring packages will 
be archived during October 2023. If you are giving a workshop or tutorial 
during the Northern hemisphere summer, aim for June.

If you still need more assistance after reading the project materials, 
raise an issue on https://github.com/r-spatial/evolution/issues or email 
me (issue better, less likely to be overlooked).

Subject: [R] Matrix scalar operation that saves memory?
Message-ID: <fc9ea9b9-f224-6de2-e184-dd9126c56f18@ngs.gen-info.osaka-u.ac.jp>

Hi all,

I am currently working with a quite large matrix that takes 300G of 
memory. My computer only has 512G of memory. I would need to do a few 
arithmetic on it with a scalar value. My current code looks like this:

mat <- 100 - mat

However such code quickly uses up all of the remaining memory and got 
the R script killed by OOM killer.

Are there any more memory-efficient way of doing such operation?

Thanks,

S. Zhang

The example given does not leave room for even a single copy of your matrix
so, yes, you need alternatives.

Your example was fairly trivial as all you wanted to do is subtract each
value from 100 and replace it. Obviously something like squaring a matrix
has no trivial way to do without multiple copies out there that won't fit.

One technique that might work is a nested loop that changes one cell of the
matrix at a time and in-place. A variant of this might be a singe loop that
changes a single row (or column) at a time and in place.

Another odd concept is to save your matrix in a file with some format you
can read back in such as a line or row at a time, and then do the
subtraction from 100 and write it back to disk in another file. If you need
it again, I assume you can read it in but perhaps you should consider how to
increase some aspects of your "memory".

Is your matrix a real matrix type or something like a list of lists or a
data.frame? You may do better with some data structures that are more
efficient than others.

Some OS allow you to use virtual memory that is mapped in and out from the
disk that allows larger things to be done, albeit often much slower. I also
note that you can remove some things you are not using and hope garbage
collection happens soon enough.

Thanks for the info.

For the data type, my matrix as of now is indeed a matrix in a perfect 
square shape filled in a previous segment of code, but I believe I could 
extract one row/column at a time to do some processing. I can also 
change that previous part of code to change the data type of it to 
something else if that helps.

Saving it to a file for manipulation and reading it back seems to be 
quite IO intensive - writing 600G of data and reading 300G back from a 
hard drive would make the code extremely heavy as well as wear my disk 
quite badly.

For now I'll try the row-by-row method and hope it works...

Sincerely,
S. Zhang

I doubt that R's basic matrix capabilities can handle this, but have a look
at the Matrix package, especially if your matrix is some special form.

One possibility might be to use Rcpp.
An R matrix is stored in contiguous memory, which can be considered as a
vector.
Define a C++ function which operates on a vector in place, as in the
following:

library(Rcpp)
cppFunction(
  'void subtractConst(NumericVector x, double c) {
  for ( int i = 0; i < x.size(); ++i)
    x[i] = x[i] - c;
}')

Try this function out on a matrix. Here we define a 5x2 matrix

m <- matrix(150.5 + 1:10, nrow=5)
print(m)

      [,1]  [,2]
[1,] 151.5 156.5

You may take a look at the bigmemory package or other which deal with large memory data in https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/HighPerformanceComputing.html#large-memory-and-out-of-memory-data
Some extra explanation is in https://stackoverflow.com/a/11127229/997979

Tema: Re: [R] Matrix scalar operation that saves memory?

One possibility might be to use Rcpp.
An R matrix is stored in contiguous memory, which can be considered as a
vector.
Define a C++ function which operates on a vector in place, as in the
following:

library(Rcpp)
cppFunction(
  'void subtractConst(NumericVector x, double c) {
  for ( int i = 0; i < x.size(); ++i)
    x[i] = x[i] - c;
}')

Try this function out on a matrix. Here we define a 5x2 matrix

m <- matrix(150.5 + 1:10, nrow=5)
print(m)

      [,1]  [,2]
[1,] 151.5 156.5
[2,] 152.5 157.5
[3,] 153.5 158.5
[4,] 154.5 159.5
[5,] 155.5 160.5

Now call the C++ function

subtractConst(m,100.0)
print(m)

    [,1] [,2]
[1,] 51.5 56.5
[2,] 52.5 57.5
[3,] 53.5 58.5
[4,] 54.5 59.5
[5,] 55.5 60.5

HTH,
Eric

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] DNAmixturesLite and KinMixLite
Message-ID: <68d2e035-6cba-b6dd-71e8-872dc2ed1f12@bristol.ac.uk>

Dear all,

We are pleased to announce that CRAN now hosts our packages 
DNAmixturesLite and KinMixLite.

These are fully R-based versions of our packages DNAmixtures and KinMix, 
which rely on a commercial software, HUGIN, for performing efficient 
computations in Bayesian networks. The lite versions rely instead on 
gRain for such computations.

DNAmixtures provides statistical methods for DNA mixture analysis and 
has been used to provide statistical evidence pertaining to DNA in 
several criminal cases in the UK and Denmark. The purpose of the newly 
released lite version is to allow users without a HUGIN software license 
to experiment with the statistical methodology. While the lite version 
aims to provide full functionality, it is noticeably less efficient than 
the original DNAmixtures package. For details on implementation and 
methodology see <https://dnamixtures.r-forge.r-project.org/>.

KinMix builds upon DNAmixtures and is a toolbox of methods for inference 
about relationships between contributors to a DNA mixture and other 
individuals of known genotype: a basic example would be testing whether 
a contributor to a mixture is the father of a child of known genotype. 
KinMixLite builds upon DNAmixturesLite and provides most of the 
functionality of the KinMix package, but with some loss of efficiency. 
The package implements the methods introduced in Green, P. J. and 
Mortera, J. (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.fsigen.2017.02.001> and Green, P. J. 
and Mortera, J. (2021) <doi:10.1111/rssc.12498>.

Therese Graversen and Peter Green

Dear members,
                            I have a script which I source it interactively. I have the following questions:


  1.  If there is an error in an expression, an error message is printed, but the execution continues till the end of the script. I am sourcing with echo. Is there any way to abort the execution when the first error occurs? This happens with R CMD BATCH. If there is an error midway, an error message is printed in the output file and the execution aborts. Is there a way to mimic this with source()?
  2.  I am trying to abort the execution with ESC key, but again the same thing happens: it aborts the current expression but continues on. How to abort an R script with source()? I am using RStudio in windows.

Please help,

THanking you,
Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

I don't see this behaviour.  If I put this in a script:

  print(1)
  stop("here")
  print(2)

then execution stops at the "stop" line if I use source(), or R CMD 
BATCH <file>, or in RStudio, Run or Source gives the same behaviour.  I 
think older versions of RStudio would have run all three lines using 
Run, but all the other methods have stopped at the stop() line.

Dear Duncan,
                         What if I use source() with echo? I am using that in RStudio.

I get similar output in every variation I tried.  It never prints the 2.

Dear Duncan,
                         But it is entirely different in my case...! As you said, the problem may be with my version of RStudio. The main point is that it doesn't pose any serious problems...

Thanks any way for your reply...

Thanking you,
Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

dear members,
                            I want to convert "12 APR 2023" into a Date object. I tried as_Date() from lubridate, but it is not working:

[1] NA
Warning message:
All formats failed to parse. No formats found.
> as_date("12-APR-2023")
[1] NA
Warning message:
All formats failed to parse. No formats found.

I am looking for a shorthand way of doing it. Of course, one can convert APR to 4 and get the job done, but I ma looking for a short and elegant code

please help...

THanking you,
Yours sincerely,

Hi,

You do not need to use third party packages for date or date/time objects in R.

If you review ?as.Date, you will see that there are two default formats for Date objects that are specified in the 'tryFormats' argument:

??tryFormats = c("%Y-%m-%d", "%Y/%m/%d")

If your date character vector does not conform to either one, which it does not in this case, then you need to explicitly specify the input format, the details of which are specified in ?strptime.

Thus:

> as.Date("12 APR 2023", format = "%d %b %Y")
[1] "2023-04-12"

> str(as.Date("12 APR 2023", format = "%d %b %Y"))
?Date[1:1], format: "2023-04-12"

> class(as.Date("12 APR 2023", format = "%d %b %Y"))
[1] "Date"

where the %d defines the day of the month number, %b defines the abbreviated month and %Y defines the four digit year. The spaces in between each specifier in the format argument reflect that there are spaces in the source vector, as opposed to hyphens (e.g. 12-APR-2023) or slashes (e.g. 12/APR/2023).

Note that once your vector is a Date class object, you can then manipulate them as dates and perform various operations on them. You can then use format() to alter the output format as you may need for other purposes, in which case, the formatted output is coerced back to a character vector, even though the internal storage is still a Date class object.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Subject: [R] Split String in regex while Keeping Delimiter
Message-ID: <AM9P195MB096556D9607BF3E2A42B2E68BC969@AM9P195MB0965.EURP195.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hello List,
?
I have a dataset consisting of strings that I want to split while saving the delimiter.
?
Some example data:
?leucocyten + gramnegatieve staven +++ grampositieve staven ++?
?leucocyten ? grampositieve coccen +?
?
I want to split the strings such that I get the following result:
c(?leucocyten +?, ??gramnegatieve staven +++?, ??grampositieve staven ++?)
c(?leucocyten ??, ?grampositieve coccen +?)
?
I have tried strsplit with a regular expression with a positive lookahead, but I am not able to achieve the results that I want.
?
I have tried:
as.list(strsplit(x, split = ?(?=[\\+-]{1,3}\\s)+, perl=TRUE)
?
Which results in:
c(?leucocyten ?, ?+?, ??gramnegatieve staven ?, ?+?, ?+?, ?+?, ??grampositieve staven ++?)
c(?leucocyten ?, ???, ?grampositieve coccen +?)
?
?
Is there a function or regular expression that will make this possible?
?
Kind regards,
Emily 
?

This seems to do the job but there are probably more elegant solutions:

f <- function(s) { sub("^ ","",unlist(strsplit(gsub("\\+ ","+@ ",s),"@"))) }
g <- function(s) { sub("^ ","",unlist(strsplit(gsub("- ","-@ ",s),"@"))) }
h <- function(s) { g(f(s)) }

To try it out:
s <- ?leucocyten + gramnegatieve staven +++ grampositieve staven ++?
t <- ?leucocyten ? grampositieve coccen +?

h(s)
h(t)

HTH,
Eric

You do not need to use third party packages for date or date/time objects in R.

If you review ?as.Date, you will see that there are two default formats for Date objects that are specified in the 'tryFormats' argument:

  tryFormats = c("%Y-%m-%d", "%Y/%m/%d")

If your date character vector does not conform to either one, which it does not in this case, then you need to explicitly specify the input format, the details of which are specified in ?strptime.

Thus:

> as.Date("12 APR 2023", format = "%d %b %Y")

> str(as.Date("12 APR 2023", format = "%d %b %Y"))
 Date[1:1], format: "2023-04-12"

> class(as.Date("12 APR 2023", format = "%d %b %Y"))
[1] "Date"

where the %d defines the day of the month number, %b defines the abbreviated month and %Y defines the four digit year. The spaces in between each specifier in the format argument reflect that there are spaces in the source vector, as opposed to hyphens (e.g. 12-APR-2023) or slashes (e.g. 12/APR/2023).

Note that once your vector is a Date class object, you can then manipulate them as dates and perform various operations on them. You can then use format() to alter the output format as you may need for other purposes, in which case, the formatted output is coerced back to a character vector, even though the internal storage is still a Date class object.

It sounds like you need positive look-behind, not look-ahead: split on
spaces only if they _follow_ one to three of '+' or '-'. Unfortunately,
repetition quantifiers like {n,m} or + are not directly supported in
look-behind expressions (nor in Perl itself). As a special case, you
can use \K, where anything to the left of \K is a zero-width positive
match:

x <- c(
 'leucocyten + gramnegatieve staven +++ grampositieve staven ++',
 'leucocyten - grampositieve coccen +'
)
strsplit(x, '[+-]{1,3}+\\K ', perl = TRUE)
# [[1]]
# [1] "leucocyten +"             "gramnegatieve staven +++"
#     "grampositieve staven ++" 
# 
# [[2]]
# [1] "leucocyten -"           "grampositieve coccen +"

Best regards,

P.S. It looks like your e-mail client has transformed every quote
character into typographically-correct Unicode quotes ?? and every
minus into an en dash, which makes it slightly harder to work with your
code, since typographically correct Unicode quotes are not R string
delimiters. Is it really ? that you'd like to split upon, or is it -?

Thank you for this useful information. Could you tell us how this build
of R was installed on this machine?

The text error is fine, there's no need for an additional screenshot.

Can you install the R development files (in particular, I'm interested
in the debugging symbols, which must live in the R-debuginfo package,
assuming you have installed R from a package) and the GNU debugger (gdb)
on this machine? Once you have done that, run R using the command 
R -d gdb, start R using the "r" command, reproduce the crash and then
post the backtrace that results from the "bt" command.

Dear members,
                            I have an xts object:

> head(INFYTX)

2003-04-21 "45.63"                "887774"               "-1.04%"

But it is populated with character values and I want to convert them to numeric. THe following code doesn't work:

Why is the coredata matrix not changing to numeric when the class is changed to numeric? How else to convert coredata into numeric?

THanking you,

Hello,

Those NA come from trying to coerce character strings with "%" to numeric.

Try instead to first remove the unwanted characters.



mat <- matrix(c(0.1, 0.2, "5.77%", "-2.03%"), ncol = 2L)

mat[] <- apply(mat, 2, \(x) sub("%", "", x))
class(mat) <- "numeric"
mat
#>      [,1]  [,2]
#> [1,]  0.1  5.77
#> [2,]  0.2 -2.03


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Hello,

Those NA come from trying to coerce character strings with "%" to numeric.

Try instead to first remove the unwanted characters.



mat <- matrix(c(0.1, 0.2, "5.77%", "-2.03%"), ncol = 2L)

mat[] <- apply(mat, 2, \(x) sub("%", "", x))
class(mat) <- "numeric"
mat
#>      [,1]  [,2]
#> [1,]  0.1  5.77
#> [2,]  0.2 -2.03


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Isn't this like trying to tie up the horse after it has left the barn? Why not figure all this out _before_ converting to xts?

I thought replacing the spaces following instances of +++,++,+,- with "\n" and then reading with scan should succeed. Like Ivan Krylov I was fairly sure that you meant the minus sign to be "-" rather than "?", but perhaps your were using MS Word as an editor which is inconsistent with effective use of R. If so, learn to use a proper programming editor, and in any case learn to post to rhelp in plain text.

Sometimes you need to NOT use a regular expression and do things simpler. You have a fairly simple example that not only does not need great power but may be a pain to do using a very powerful technique, especially if you want to play with look-ahead and look behind.

Assuming you have a line with repeated runs on non-plussed text followed by one to three contiguous runs of a plus sign, can you write a short function that scans along till it finds a plus sign, then looks ahead till it sees a space or the end of the line. It then wraps up all the text till the last plus and adds a copy to a growing list or other structure. It then continues from the space(s) it ignores and repeats.

When done, you have what you want in the format you want.

A variant on this is to start from the end and scan backwards and stop at any plus sign. Keep what follows but strip any whitespace to the left of it. The result is the list in backwards order unless you used a stack to hold it.

There are quite a few variants that might apply and perhaps use of functions in modules. A dumb example might be to preprocess the string and replace all instances of 1 to 3 plus signs and an optional space  with itself and an added letter like a ":" and then a second pass using a regular expression becomes trivial as the colons disappear.

I always find regex puzzles amusing, so after changing the unicode
typo quotes and dashes to ascii, the following simple prescription,
similar to those proffered by others, seems to produce what you
requested with your example:

x <- c("leucocyten + gramnegatieve staven +++ grampositieve staven ++",
 "leucocyten - grampositieve coccen +")

strsplit(gsub("([^[:alnum:]]) ","\\1>>",x),">>")

(You can use unlist on this if you wish).

My slight variant uses character classes and a backreference to
identify where you want to split. The substitute '>>' split expression
is purely arbitrary of course. Instead of [^[:alnum:]] you could
probably use [+-], but I only wished to assume some sort of
non-alphanumeric.

I mention in passing that the above also seemed to work when I kept
the en dash instead of a minus sign, but I make no claim for
superiority -- or even noninferiority --  to the solutions proposed by
others.

Cheers,
Bert

You didn't post the backtrace, so I don't have the full picture, but
the crash seems to be happening in your TLS implementation (NSS), most
likely because the AES GCM context pointer somehow turned out to be
NULL. Is there a way to install a libcurl build linked with a different
TLS back-end (e.g. OpenSSL)?

How exactly did you install R?

"wear your disc quite badly"?
If you can afford a computer with 512 GB of memory,
you can afford to pay $100 for a 2 TB external SSD,
use it as scratch space, and throw it away after a
month of use.  A hard drive is expected to last for
more than 40,000 hours of constant use.  Are you
sure that your own disc is so fragile?  Hard drives
are pretty cheap these days.  You could afford to
pay $50 for a 2 TB external hard drive, use it as
scratch space, and throw it away.

I've been around long enough to remember when the idea
of processing a 1000x1000 matrix in memory was greeted
with hysterical laughter and a recommendation to stop
smoking whatever I was smoking.   (But not old enough
to remember shuffling matrices around on tape.  Shudder.)

If you want to work on two 300GB matrices using a machine
with 512GB of RAM, you are going to be using a disc or
SSD, like it or not.  You can leave it up to the paging
subsystem of your OS, which will do its poor best, or you
can explicitly schedule reads and writes in your program,
and if you use asynchronous I/O it might overlap quite nicely.

Assuming for the sake of arithmetic that your matrix
elements are complex numbers represented as pairs of
double precision floats, that's 16 bytes per element,
or 300e9/16 = 1.975e10 elements = n^2 elements where n = 136,930.
Other than adding, subtracting, and multiplying by a scalar,
there's not much you can do with an nxn matrix that won't take
time proportional to n^3.

Is there any way you can divide the matrix into (possibly
overlapping) blocks and do the work on a cluster?  Or a
block at a time?

Since any space that follows 2 or 3 + signs (or - signs) also follows
a single + (or -), this can be done with positive look behind, which
may be a little simpler:

x <- c(
  'leucocyten + gramnegatieve staven +++ grampositieve staven ++',
  'leucocyten - grampositieve coccen +'
)
strsplit(x, "(?<=[+-])\\s+", perl=TRUE)

An alternative is to use the strapply function(s) in the gsubfn
package which focus on what you want to keep for each piece rather
than what to split on.

Here is an example that says to keep a sequence of characters that are
not + or -, followed by 1 to 3 + or - characters:

library(gsubfn)
strapplyc(x, "[^+-]+[+-]{1,3}")

This includes the spaces at the beginning of the return strings after
the first, a couple of options that drop these spaces as well are:

strapply(x, "([^+-]+[+-]{1,3}) *", backref = -1)
strapply(x, "[^ +-][^+-]+[+-]{1,3}")

Message-ID: <40adca2d-6412-934f-9a47-977537641e93@syonic.eu>

Dear Emily,

Using a look-behind solves the split problem in this case. (Note: Using 
Regex is in most/many cases the simplest solution.)

str = c("leucocyten + gramnegatieve staven +++ grampositieve staven ++",
"leucocyten ? grampositieve coccen +")

tokens = strsplit(str, "(?<=[-+])\\s++", perl=TRUE)

PROBLEM
The current expression does NOT work for a different reason: the "-" is 
coded using a NON-ASCII character.

I have written a small utility function to approximately extract 
"non-standard" characters:
### Identify non-ASCII Characters
# beware: the filtering and the sorting may break the codes;
extract.nonLetters = function(x, rm.space = TRUE, sort=FALSE) {
 ?? ?code = as.numeric(unique(unlist(lapply(x, charToRaw))));
 ?? ?isLetter =
 ?? ???? (code >= 97 & code <= 122) |
 ?? ???? (code >= 65 & code <= 90);
 ?? ?code = code[ ! isLetter];
 ?? ?if(rm.space) {
 ?? ???? # removes only simple space!
 ?? ???? code = code[code != 32];
 ?? ?}
 ?? ?if(sort) code = sort(code);
 ?? ?return(code);
}
extract.nonLetters(str, sort = FALSE)
# 43 226 128 147

Note:
- the code for "+" is 43, and for simple "-" is 45: as.numeric 
(charToRaw("+-"));
- "226 128 147" codes something else, but it is not trivial to get the 
Unicode code Point;
https://www.utf8-chartable.de/unicode-utf8-table.pl?start=8192&number=128&utf8=dec

The following is a more comprehensive Regex expression, which accepts 
many variants of "-":
tokens = strsplit(str, "(?<=[-+\u2010-\u2014])\\s++", perl=TRUE)

Sincerely,

Leonard

Dear Emily,

I have written a more robust version of the function:
extract.nonLetters = function(x, rm.space = TRUE, normalize=TRUE, 
sort=TRUE) {
 ?? ?if(normalize) str = stringi::stri_trans_nfc(str);
 ?? ?ch = strsplit(str, "", fixed = TRUE);
 ?? ?ch = unique(unlist(ch));
 ?? ?if(sort) ch = sort(ch);
 ?? ?pat = if(rm.space) "^[a-zA-Z ]" else "^[a-zA-Z]";
 ?? ?isLetter = grepl(pat, ch);
 ?? ?ch = ch[ ! isLetter];
 ?? ?return(stringi::stri_escape_unicode(ch));
}
extract.nonLetters(str)
# "\\u2013" "+"

This code ("\u2013") is included in the expanded Regex expression:
tokens = strsplit(str, "(?<=[-+\u2010-\u2014])\\s++", perl=TRUE)


Sincerely,

Leonard

You first have to load the package using the library command.

Then you can call createDataPartition. e.g.

Eric,

Yes, i know, i am calling the package, but this is not working.
I saw a similar question in Stackoverflow, advising install package Rcpp,
but this one i am unable to install.

Do you mean downloading or installation? What exactly happens when
you're having difficulties?

If it's the download that fails, ask your Internet service provider
and/or try a different mirror that may be closer to you or just
better-connected: https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html

R will work even without XQuartz installed (except for some functions,
notably tcltk). Again, what exactly are you doing and what exactly
happens that goes contrary to your expectations?

Follow the guide http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html (or at
least the R-help posting guide that you should have read before
posting, <https://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html>) to help us
help you. It is currently impossible to give you any specific advice
based on the information you've given us so far.

Or is there any similar function to split the dataframe to trainDF and
testDF?

Please don't send any more screenshots. They are needlessly large and
impossible to copy text from. You could have fit more than forty two
thousand ASCII symbols in the space occupied by that 17 lines, and it
would have been easier to work with.

I cannot help you further without at least the backtrace, but it looks
like you have a defect in your NSS installation. You need help from a
CentOS expert or an NSS expert; there's nothing that can be fixed in R
to make it work, short of getting a custom build of a different TLS
library and a custom build of libcurl linked against said library, then
linking your custom R build against this libcurl. (But then you're on
the hook for updating both libraries when the inevitable security fixes
start rolling in.)

For RedHat-related problems, try r-sig-fedora at r-project.org, but if you
don't give them enough information, they won't help you either.

prettyseq() is in the seqinr package. That seems to usher in a lot of other
issues.

How about caTools::sample.split() ?   (I have never used it, I just learned
about it from a search)

https://rdrr.io/cran/caTools/src/R/sample.split.R

Good luck,
Eric

You should post the result of running sessionInfo(), and tell us how you 
installed R.  Your installation seems very broken.

Two hints:

1. The NAMESPACE is meant and he trnlsation is very literal here.

2. I typically have LANGUAGE=en set for R to avoid confusion.

It doesn't. namesraum = namespace which is technically different than
a paket = package (as you, as a German speaker, know of course). I
leave it to you to search for suitable references on the details of
what these are in R, unless someone wiser than I offers a
mini-tutorial here.

But glad I could help.

Best,
Bert

Dear members,
                         I am doing some modelling with caret package in R. I do suppose that the package doesn't consider AIC and BIC for model selection, right? They penalise the number of prameters, but I am ready to spend a little more time and a little more money to run the model with more number of parameters, but with a very less SSE.

I know that AIC and BIC are not meant for non parametric ML models, but just want to confirm....

Thanking you,
Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

This is a statistical question, not actually a question about R, and thus not on topic. Using too many variables leads to models that tend to have large errors on new data (not from your fitting sample). [1]

This is a statistical question, not actually a question about R, and thus not on topic. Using too many variables leads to models that tend to have large errors on new data (not from your fitting sample). [1]

Dear members,
                          I have a function FUN1 that downloads some data from the internet. It so happens that the function doesn't work the first time, but on the second or third attempt it works. I want to run the function repeatedly for four times if it throws an error:

X <- tryCatch(FUN1, error = function(c) {FUN1})

This runs the function two times. But I want to run the function four times if throws an error, but on the fifth attempt if it throws an error, abort. I know I can include the tryCatch call inside FUN1 and call it, but any short and elegant code to that effect?

Thanking you,
Yours sincerely
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

My guess (without having used it) is that this uses AIC in a stepwise model building approach.

    fails <- 0L
    internal <- function() {

        tryCatch({

which should attempt to download the files, stopping after 4 failed attempt[[elided Hotmail spam]]

In my Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, I use R via emacs launched from terminal. While R computations work well, viewing graphs is inconvenient.  I am not able to use screen device.  I can send graphs to a png or pdf file, then open the file.  

I would like a setup where code is run in one window while graphs are displayed in another window.  Has anyone created a setup like this?

You don't say which OS's you are running, but if you can run an X server 
on your local machine, the remote R process should be able to display 
graphs there (as long as it is running on a Unix-alike).

Dear All:



*Re:* detect and replace outliers by the average



The dataset, please see attached, contains a group factoring column ?
*factor*? and two columns of data ?x1? and ?x2? with some NA values. I need
some help to detect the outliers and replace it and the NAs with the
average within each level (0,1,2) for each variable ?x1? and ?x2?.



I tried the below code, but it did not accomplish what I want to do.





data<-read.csv("G:/20-Spring_2023/Outliers/data.csv", header=TRUE)

data

replace_outlier_with_mean <- function(x) {

  replace(x, x %in% boxplot.stats(x)$out, mean(x, na.rm=TRUE))  #### ,
na.rm=TRUE NOT working

}

data[] <- lapply(data, replace_outlier_with_mean)





Thank you all very much for your help in advance.





with many thanks

abou

Hello,

There is no data set attached, see the posting guide on what file 
extensions are allowed as attachments.

As for the question, try to compute mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)  first, then 
use this value in the replace instruction. Without data I'm just guessing.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Dear All:  the attached file in the  .txt format



*Re:* detect and replace outliers by the average



The dataset, please see attached, contains a group factoring column ?
*factor*? and two columns of data ?x1? and ?x2? with some NA values. I need
some help to detect the outliers and replace it and the NAs with the
average  within each level (0,1,2) for each variable ?x1? and ?x2?.



I tried the below code, but it did not accomplish what I want to do.



The average within each level should be computed after discard the outliers.



data<-read.csv("G:/20-Spring_2023/Outliers/data.csv", header=TRUE)

data

replace_outlier_with_mean <- function(x) {

  replace(x, x %in% boxplot.stats(x)$out, mean(x, na.rm=TRUE))  #### ,
na.rm=TRUE NOT working

}

data[] <- lapply(data, replace_outlier_with_mean)





Thank you all very much for your help in advance.





with many thanks

abou

Hello,

Here is a way. It uses ave in the function to group the data by the factor.

replace_outlier_with_mean <- function(x, f) {
   ave(x, f, FUN = \(y) {
     i <- is.na(y) | y %in% boxplot.stats(y, do.conf = FALSE)$out
     y[i] <- mean(y, na.rm = TRUE)
     y
   })

lapply(df1[-1], replace_outlier_with_mean, f = df1$factor)

Hello,

A simpler version of the same function, this time with replace(), like 
the OP. The results are identical().


replace_outlier_with_mean <- function(x, f) {
   ave(x, f, FUN = \(y) {
     i <- is.na(y) | y %in% boxplot.stats(y, do.conf = FALSE)$out
     replace(y, i, mean(y, na.rm = TRUE))
   })
}


Also, my data copy&paste from a previous mail, is wrong, there are 3 
NA's in the wrong column. The following is better.

df1 <- read.table("data.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t",
                   colClasses = c("factor", "numeric", "numeric"))


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Subject: [R] glm.nb and Error in x[good, ,
 drop = FALSE] * w : non-conformable arrays
Message-ID: <35801bde-1031-36e5-9707-f75205caef36@univ-fcomte.fr>

Dear Listers,

I meet an error with glm.nb that I cannot explain the origin (and find a 
fix). The model I want to fit is the following:

library(MASS)

glm.nb(deg~offset(log(durobs))+zone,data=db)

and the data.frame is dumped below.

Has anyone an idea about what the trouble comes from ? (except computing 
leads to a non-conformable array somewhere... the question is why; 
fitting goes through without any problem eg with a Poisson link)

Best,

Patrick

Thank you for providing both the code and a small piece of data that
reproduces the error!

(It almost worked. Your mailer automatically generated a plain text
version of the e-mail and put Unicode non-breaking spaces in there. R
considers it a syntax error to encounter any of the various Unicode
space-like characters outside string literals.)

The problem is that `deg` is a table, which ends up making the
effective weights a table too. tables are arrays, and element-wise
product rules are stricter for them than for plain matrices. The code
makes use of the ability to take an element-wise product between a
matrix and a vector of the same length as the number of rows in the
matrix:

matrix(1:12, 4) * 1:4 # works
matrix(1:12, 4) * as.array(1:4) # results in the same error

# the right way to take products with an array is to make sure that the
# shapes match exactly
matrix(1:12, 4) * as.array(cbind(1:4, 1:4, 1:4))

One possible solution is to to remove all attributes from db$deg:

db$deg <- as.vector(db$deg)

This way the values of the expressions involved in glm.fit end up being
of the expected type, and the function completes successfully.

Many thanks Ivan ! This is fairly clear to me, now... When I dumped the 
data.frame, I found strange to have a "table" declaration for deg, but 
was not able to judge if it was a problem or not (I would have expected 
something as "numeric")
Your workaround is fine to me (I do not need to carry on with table 
attributes).
Best,
Patrick

Hello,

I am writing to seek assistance regarding a warning message that I
encountered while running a CLMM with two main factors and one random
factor ("participants"). One of the main factors consists of six
levels that can be either categorical or numerical.

As this is my first time running this type of model, I would greatly
appreciate your expertise in understanding and resolving this issue.

Thank you in advance for your time and support.

Debugging, like the CLMM modelling that you're trying to perform here,
can be described as a kind of inverse problem: given experimental data
('Some kind of warning is raised by length(barlist) == 1 &&
as.character(barlist[[1]][[2]]) == "1"'), one intends to model the
state of the program at the time when the problem happens (since it's
the whole expression that raises the warning and not any of its parts,
perhaps barlist[[1]][[2]] is of length() > 1? But that's an error in
recent versions of R, and used to be a warning in a few older
versions...) and go about solving the problem from there.

Sometimes, there's not enough experimental data, and the problem
becomes ill-posed: strictly speaking, given the information above,
there can be too many possible explanations for what you're
experiencing. I see you've provided some information, but it's better
to start with the full error message, the code you're running and a
small piece of data that would reproduce the error on a different
computer.

Sometimes, it's possible to apply one's psychic debugging skills (read:
make educated guesses and hope they are right) to regularise the
ill-posed problem and solve it anyway. Searching CRAN for "clmm" yields
the "ordinal" package, which has a clmm() function, which calls another
function to operate on a variable called "barlist" and which also has
been recently (November 2022) changed to read:

>> length(barlist) == 1 && as.character(barlist[[1]][[2]])[1] == "1"

(Note the extra [1] compared to the expression in your warning message.)

Have you tried upgrading to ordinal version 2022.11-16?

If that doesn't help, please provide the full warning, the code and the
data to reproduce it, and the sessionInfo() output.

Ivan

This is the relevant part of the NEWS file

CHANGES IN R 4.3.0:

  SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:

    * Calling && or || with LHS or (if evaluated) RHS of length greater
      than one is now always an error, with a report of the form

          'length = 4' in coercion to 'logical(1)'
      
      Environment variable _R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_LOGIC2_ no longer has any
      effect.

  NEW FEATURES:

    * The included BLAS sources have been updated to those shipped with
      LAPACK version 3.10.1.  (This caused some platform-dependent
      changes to package check output.)  And then to the sources from
      LAPACK version 3.11.0 (with changes only to double complex
      subroutines).

    * The included LAPACK sources have been updated to include the four
      Fortran 90 routines rather than their Fortran 77 predecessors.
      This may give some different signs in SVDs or
      eigendecompositions..  (This completes the transition to LAPACK
      3.10.x begun in R 4.2.0.)

    * The LAPACK sources have been updated to version 3.11.0.  (No new
      subroutines have been added, so this almost entirely bug fixes:
      Those fixes do affect some computations with NaNs, including R's
      NA.)

    * The parser now signals _classed_ errors, notably in case of the
      pipe operator |>.  The error object and message now give line and
      column numbers, mostly as proposed and provided by Duncan Murdoch
      in PR#18328.

    * toeplitz() is now generalized for asymmetric cases, with a
      toeplitz2() variant.

    * xy.coords() and xyz.coords() and consequently, e.g., plot(x,y,
      log = "y") now signal a _classed_ warning about negative values
      of y (where log(.) is NA).  Such a warning can be specifically
      suppressed or caught otherwise.

    * Regular expression functions now check more thoroughly whether
      their inputs are valid strings (in their encoding, e.g. in
      UTF-8).

    * The performance of grep(), sub(), gsub() and strsplit() has been
      improved, particularly with perl = TRUE and fixed = TRUE.  Use of
      useBytes = TRUE for performance reasons should no longer be
      needed and is discouraged: it may lead to incorrect results.

    * apropos() gains an argument dot_internals which is used by the
      completion (help(rcompgen)) engine to also see base internals
      such as .POSIXct().

    * Support in tools::Rdiff() for comparing uncompressed PDF files is
      further reduced - see its help page.

    * qqplot(x, y, ...) gains conf.level and conf.args arguments for
      computing and plotting a confidence band for the treatment
      function transforming the distribution of x into the distribution
      of y (Switzer, 1976, _Biometrika_). Contributed by Torsten
      Hothorn.

    * Performance of package_dependencies() has been improved for cases
      when the number of dependencies is large.

    * Strings newly created by gsub(), sub() and strsplit(), when any
      of the inputs is marked as "bytes", are also marked as "bytes".
      This reduces the risk of creating invalid strings and accidental
      substitution of bytes deemed invalid.

    * Support for readLines(encoding = "bytes") has been added to allow
      processing special text files byte-by-byte, without creating
      invalid strings.

    * iconv(from = "") now takes into account any declared encoding of
      the input elements and uses it in preference to the native
      encoding.  This reduces the risk of accidental creation of
      invalid strings, particularly when different elements of the
      input have different encoding (including "bytes").

    * Package repositories in getOption("repos") are now initialized
      from the repositories file when utils is loaded (if not already
      set, e.g., in .Rprofile).  (From a report and patch proposal by
      Gabriel Becker in PR#18405.)

    * compactPDF() gets a verbose option.

    * type.convert() and hence read.table() get new option tryLogical =
      TRUE with back compatible default.  When set to false, converts
      "F" or "T" columns to character.

    * Added new unit prefixes "R" and "Q" for abbreviating
      (unrealistically large) sizes beyond 10^{27} in standard = "SI",
      thanks to Henrik Bengtsson's PR#18435.

    * as.data.frame()'s default method now also works fine with atomic
      objects inheriting from classes such as "roman", "octmode" and
      "hexmode", such fulfilling the wish of PR#18421, by Benjamin
      Feakins.

    * The as.data.frame.vector() utility now errors for wrong-length
      row.names.  It warned for almost six years, with "Will be an
      error!".

    * sessionInfo() now also contains La_version() and reports codepage
      and timezone when relevant, in both print() and toLatex() methods
      which also get new option tzone for displaying timezone
      information when locale = FALSE.

    * New function R_compiled_by() reports the C and Fortran compilers
      used to build R, if known.

    * predict(<lm>, newdata = *) no longer unnecessarily creates an
      offset of all 0s.

    * solve() for complex inputs now uses argument tol and by default
      checks for 'computational singularity' (as it long has done for
      numeric inputs).

    * predict(<rank-deficient lm>, newdata=*) now obeys a new argument
      rankdeficient, with new default "warnif", warning only if there
      are non-estimable cases in newdata.  Other options include
      rankdeficient = "NA", predicting NA for non-estimable newdata
      cases.  This addresses PR#15072 by Russ Lenth and is based on his
      original proposal and discussions in PR#16158 also by David Firth
      and Elin Waring.  Still somewhat experimental.

    * Rgui console implementation now works better with the NVDA screen
      reader when the full blinking cursor is selected.  The underlying
      improvements in cursor handling may help also other screen
      readers on Windows.

    * The drop-field control in GraphApp can now be left with the TAB
      key and all controls can be navigated in the reverse order using
      the Shift+TAB key, improving accessibility of the Rgui
      configuration editor.

    * qnorm(<very large negative>, log.p=TRUE) is now fully accurate
      (instead of to "only" minimally five digits).

    * demo(error.catching) now also shows off withWarnings() and
      tryCatchWEMs().

    * As an experimental feature the placeholder _ can now also be used
      in the rhs of a forward pipe |> expression as the first argument
      in an extraction call, such as _$coef. More generally, it can be
      used as the head of a chain of extractions, such as _$coef[[2]].

    * Spaces in the environment variable used to choose the R session's
      temporary directory (TMPDIR, TMP and TEMP are tried in turn) are
      now fatal.  (On Windows the 'short path' version of the path is
      tried and used if that does not contain a space.)

    * all.equal.numeric() gets a new optional switch giveErr to return
      the numeric error as attribute.  Relatedly,
      stopifnot(all.equal<some>(a, b, ..)) is as "smart" now, as
      stopifnot(all.equal(....)) has been already, thus allowing
      customized all.equal<Some>() wrappers.

    * R on Windows is now able to work with path names longer than 260
      characters when these are enabled in the system (requires at
      least Windows 10 version 1607).  Packages should be updated to
      work with long paths as well, instead of assuming PATH_MAX to be
      the maximum length.  Custom front-ends and applications embedding
      R need to update their manifests if they wish to allow this
      feature.  See
      <https://blog.r-project.org/2023/03/07/path-length-limit-on-windows>
      for more information.

    * 'Object not found' and 'Missing argument' errors now give a more
      accurate error context. Patch provided by Lionel Henry in
      PR#18241.

    * The @ operator is now an S3 generic. Based on contributions by
      Tomasz Kalinowski in PR#18482.

    * New generic chooseOpsMethod() provides a mechanism for objects to
      resolve cases where two suitable methods are found for an Ops
      Group Generic. This supports experimenting with alternative
      object systems. Based on contributions by Tomasz Kalinowski in
      PR#18484.

    * inherits(x, what) now accepts values other than a simple
      character vector for argument what. A new generic, nameOfClass(),
      is called to resolve the class name from what. This supports
      experimenting with alternative object systems. Based on
      contributions by Tomasz Kalinowski in PR#18485.

    * Detection of BLAS/LAPACK in use (sessionInfo()) with FlexiBLAS
      now reports the current backend.

    * The "data.frame" method for subset() now warns about extraneous
      arguments, typically catching the use of = instead of == in the
      subset expression.

    * Calling a:b when numeric a or b is longer than one may now be
      made into an error by setting environment variable
      _R_CHECK_LENGTH_COLON_ to a true value, along the proposal in
      PR#18419 by Henrik Bengtsson.

    * density(x, weights = *) now warns if automatic bandwidth
      selection happens without using weights; new optional warnWbw may
      suppress the warning.  Prompted by Christoph Dalitz' PR#18490 and
      its discussants.

    * rm(list = *) is faster and more readable thanks to Kevin Ushey's
      PR#18492.

    * The plot.lm() function no longer produces a normal Q-Q plot for
      GLMs. Instead it plots a half-normal Q-Q plot of the absolute
      value of the standardized deviance residuals.

    * The print() method for class "summary.glm" no longer shows
      summary statistics for the deviance residuals by default.  Its
      optional argument show.residuals can be used to show them if
      required.

    * The tapply() function now accepts a data frame as its X argument,
      and allows INDEX to be a formula in that case. by.data.frame()
      similarly allows INDICES to be a formula.

    * The performance of df[j] <- value (including for missing j) and
      write.table(df) has been improved for data frames df with a large
      number of columns.  (Thanks to Gabriel Becker's PR#18500,
      PR#18503 and discussants, prompted by a report from Toby Dylan
      Hocking on the R-devel mailing list.)

    * The matrix multiply operator %*% is now an S3 generic, belonging
      to new group generic matrixOps.  From Tomasz Kalinowski's
      contribution in PR#18483.

    * New function array2DF() to convert arrays to data frames,
      particularly useful for the list arrays created by tapply().

  DATES and TIMES:

    * On platforms where (non-UTC) datetimes before 1902 (or before
      1900 as with system functions on recent macOS) are guessed by
      extrapolating time zones from 1902-2037, there is a warning at
      the first use of extrapolation in a session.  (As all time zones
      post 2037 are extrapolation, we do not warn on those.)

    * (Platforms using --with-internal-tzone, including Windows and by
      default macOS). How years are printed in dates or date-times can
      be controlled by environment variable R_PAD_YEARS_BY_ZERO.  The
      default remains to pad to 4 digits by zeroes, but setting value
      no gives no padding (as used by default by glibc).

    * strftime() tries harder to determine the offset for the "%z"
      format, and succeeds on the mainstream R platforms.

    * strftime() has a limit of 2048 bytes on the string produced -
      attempting to exceed this is an error.  (Previously it silently
      truncated at 255 bytes.)

    * sessionInfo() records (and by default prints) the system time
      zone as part of the locale information.  Also, the source
      (system/internal) of the date-time conversion and printing
      functions.

    * Objects of class "POSIXlt" created in this version of R always
      have 11 components: component zone is always set, and component
      gmtoff is set for times in UTC and usually set on the (almost
      all) platforms which have C-level support, otherwise is NA.

    * There are comprehensive validity checks on the structure of
      objects of class "POSIXlt" when converting (including formatting
      and printing).  (This avoids mis-conversions of hand-crafted
      objects.)

    * There is some support for using the native date-time routines on
      macOS: this is only viable on recent versions (e.g. 12.6 and 13)
      and does get wrong some historical changes (before 1900, during
      WWII).  Use of --with-internal-tzone remains the default.

    * as.POSIXct(<numeric>) and as.POSIXlt(.) (without specifying
      origin) now work.  So does as.Date(<numeric>).

    * as.Date.POSIXct(., tz) now treats several tz values, notably
      "GMT" as equivalent to "UTC", proposed and improved by Michael
      Chirico and Joshua Ulrich in PR#17674.

    * Experimental balancePOSIXlt() utility allows using "ragged" and
      or out-of-range "POSIXlt" objects more correctly, e.g., in
      subsetting and subassignments.  Such objects are now documented.

      More experimentally, a "POSIXlt" object may have an attribute
      "balanced" indicating if it is known to be filled or fully
      balanced.

    * Functions axis.Date() and axis.POSIXct() are rewritten to gain
      better default tick locations and better default formats by using
      prettyDate(). Thanks to Swetlana Herbrandt.

    * The mapping of Windows' names for time zones to IANA's 'Olson'
      names has been updated.  When ICU is available (it is by
      default), it is used to get a mapping for the current region set
      in Windows.  This can be overridden by setting environment
      variable TZ to the desired Olson name - see OlsonNames() for
      those currently available.

  GRAPHICS:

    * The graphics engine version, R_GE_version, has been bumped to 16
      and so packages that provide graphics devices should be
      reinstalled.

    * The grDevices and grid packages have new functions for rendering
      typeset glyphs, primarily: grDevices::glyphInfo() and
      grid::grid.glyph().

      Rendering of typeset glyphs is only supported so far on the
      Cairo-based graphics devices and on the pdf() and quartz()
      devices.

    * The defined behaviour for "clear" and "source" compositing
      operators (via grid::grid.group()) has been changed (to align
      better with simple interpretation of original Porter-Duff
      definitions).

    * Support for gradients, patterns, clipping paths, masks, groups,
      compositing operators, and affine transformations has been added
      to the quartz() device.

  INSTALLATION on a UNIX-ALIKE:

    * A system installation of generic LAPACK 3.10.0 or later will be
      preferred to the version in the R sources.

      configure option --with-lapack=no (equivalently --without-lapack)
      forces compilation of the internal LAPACK sources.

      If --with-lapack is not specified, a system liblapack is looked
      for and used if it reports version 3.10.0 or later and does not
      contain BLAS routines.

      Packages using LAPACK will need to be reinstalled if this changes
      to using an external library.

    * On aarch64 Linux platforms using GCC, configure now defaults to
      -fPIC (instead of -fpic), as desired in PR#18326.

    * configure now checks conversion of datetimes between POSIXlt and
      POSIXct around year 2020.  Failure (which has been seen on
      platforms missing tzdata) is fatal.

    * If configure option --with-valgrind-instrumentation is given
      value 1 or 2, option --with-system-valgrind-headers is now the
      default and ignored (with a warning).  It is highly recommended
      that the system headers are installed alongside valgrind: they
      are part of its packaging on some Linux distributions and
      packaged separately (e.g. in the valgrind-devel RPM) on others.
      configure will give a warning if they are not found.

      The system headers will be required in a future release of R to
      build with valgrind instrumentation.

    * libcurl 8.x is now accepted by configure: despite a change in
      major version number it changes neither API nor ABI.

  INSTALLATION on WINDOWS:

    * The makefiles and installer scripts for Windows have been
      tailored to Rtools43, an update of the Rtools42 toolchain.  It is
      based on gcc 12 and newer versions of MinGW-W64, binutils and
      libraries.  At this time R-devel can still be built using
      Rtools42 without changes, but when R-devel is installed via the
      installer, it will by default look for Rtools43.

    * Old make targets rsync-extsoft and 32-bit ones that are no longer
      needed have been removed.

    * Default builds (including for packages) no longer select C99.
      Thus the C standard used is the default for the compiler, which
      for the toolchain in Rtools43 is C17.  (This is consistent with
      Unix builds.)

  PACKAGE INSTALLATION:

    * The default C++ standard has been changed to C++17 where
      available (which it is on all currently checked platforms): if
      not C++14 or C++11 is used if available otherwise C++ is not
      supported.

    * USE_FC_LEN_T is the default: this uses the correct
      (compiler-dependent) prototypes for Fortran BLAS/LAPACK routines
      called from C/C++, and requires adjustment of many such calls -
      see 'Writing R Extensions' SS6.6.1.

    * There is initial support for C++23 as several compilers are now
      supporting -std=c++23 or -std=c++2b or similar.  As for C++20,
      there no additional configure checks for C++23 features beyond a
      check that the compiler reports a __cplusplus value greater than
      that in the C++20 standard.  C++ feature tests should be used.

    * There is support for a package to indicate the version of the C
      standard which should be used to compile it, and for the
      installing user to specify this.  In most cases R defaults to the
      C compiler's default standard which is C17 (a `bug-fix' of C11) -
      earlier versions of R or compilers may have defaulted to C99.

      Current options are:

      USE_C17 Use a standard that is at most C17.  The intention is to
          allow legacy packages to still be installed when later C
          standards become the default, including packages using new
          keywords as identifiers or with K&R-style function
          declarations.  This will use C17 if available, falling back
          to C11.

      USE_C90 Use the C90 (aka C89) standard.  (As that standard did
          not require compilers to identify that version, all we can
          verify is that the compiler does not claim to be using a
          later standard.  It may accept C99 features - for example
          clang accepts // to make comments.)

      USE_C99 Use the C99 standard. This should be rarely needed - it
          avoids the few new features of C11/C17 which can be useful if
          a package assumes them if C17 is specified and they are not
          implemented.

      USE_C23 Use C23 (or in future, later).  Compiler/library support
          for C23 is still being implemented, but LLVM clang from
          15.0.0 and the upcoming GCC 13 have quite extensive support.

      These can be specified as part of the SystemRequirements field in
      the package's DESCRIPTION file or _via_ options --use-C17 and so
      on of R CMD INSTALL and R CMD SHLIB.

      For further details see "Writing R Extensions" SS1.2.5.

    * (Windows) A src/Makefile.ucrt or src/Makefile.win file is now
      included after R_HOME/etcR_ARCH/Makeconf and so no longer needs
      to include that file itself.  Installation of a package with such
      a file now uses a site Makevars file in the same way as a package
      with a src/Makevars.win file would.

    * configure is now passed crucial variables such as CC and CFLAGS
      in its environment, as many packages were not setting them (as
      documented in 'Writing R Extensions' SS1.2).

      This has most effect where configure is used to compile parts of
      the package - most often by cmake or libtool which obfuscate the
      actual compile commands used.

      Also used for configure.win and configure.ucrt on Windows.

  FORTRAN FLAGS:

    * The flag -fno-optimize-sibling-calls is no longer forced for
      gfortran 7 and later.  It should no longer be needed now using
      'hidden' character-length arguments when calling BLAS/LAPACK
      routines from C/C++ is the default even for packages.  (Unless
      perhaps packages call Fortran code from C/C++ without using R's
      headers and without allowing for these arguments.)

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    * The deprecated S-compatibility macros DOUBLE_* in
      R_ext/Constants.h (included by R.h) have been removed.

    * The deprecated legacy typedefs of Sint and Sfloat in header R.h
      are no longer defined, and that header no longer includes header
      limits.h from C nor climits from C++.

    * New macro CAD5R() is provided in Rinternals.h and used in a few
      places in the R sources.

    * ALTREP now supports VECSXP vectors. Contributed by Gabor Csardi
      in PR#17620.

    * The Rcomplex definition (in header R_ext/Complex.h) has been
      extended to prevent possible mis-compilation when interfacing
      with Fortran (PR#18430).  The new definition causes compiler
      warnings with static initializers such as {1, 2}, which can be
      changed to {.r=1, .i=2}.

      Using the new definition from C++ depends on compiler extensions
      supporting C features that have not been incorporated into the
      C++ standards but are available in g++ and clang++: this may
      result in C++ compiler warnings but these have been worked around
      for recent versions of common compilers (GCC, Apple/LLVM clang,
      Intel).

      It is intended to change the inclusion of header R_ext/Complex.h
      by other R headers, so C/C++ code files which make use of
      Rcomplex should include that header explicitly.

  UTILITIES:

    * R CMD check does more checking of package .Rd files, warning
      about invalid email addresses and (some) invalid URIs and noting
      empty \item labels in description lists.

    * R CMD check now also reports problems when reading package news
      in md (file NEWS.md) and (optionally) plain text (file NEWS)
      formats.

    * _R_CHECK_TIMINGS_ defaults to a value from the environment even
      for R CMD check --as-cran; this allows for exceptionally fast or
      slow platforms.

      It now applies to checking PDF and HTML versions of the manuals,
      and 'checking CRAN incoming feasibility'.

    * R CMD check can optionally (but included in --as-cran) check
      whether HTML math rendering _via_ KaTeX works for the package .Rd
      files.

    * Non-interactive debugger invocations can be trapped by setting
      the environment variable _R_CHECK_BROWSER_NONINTERACTIVE_ to a
      true value.  This is enabled by R CMD check --as-cran to detect
      the use of leftover browser() statements in the package.

    * The use of sprintf and vsprintf from C/C++ has been deprecated in
      macOS 13 and is a known security risk.  R CMD check now reports
      (on all platforms) if their use is found in compiled code:
      replace by snprintf or vsnprintf respectively. [*NB:* whether
      such calls get compiled into the package is platform-dependent.]

    * Where recorded at installation, R CMD check reports the C and
      Fortran compilers used to build R.

      It reports the OS in use (if known, as given by osVersion) as
      well as that R was built for.

      It notes if a C++ standard was specified which is older than the
      current default: many packages have used C++11 to mean 'not
      C++98' - as C++11 is the minimum supported since R 4.0.0, that
      specification can probably be removed.

    * R CMD INSTALL reports the compilers (and on macOS, the SDK) used,
      and this is copied to the output of R CMD check.

      Where a C++ standard is specified, it is reported.

    * R CMD check's 'checking compilation flags in Makevars' has been
      relaxed to accept the use of flags such as -std=f2008 in
      PKG_FFLAGS.

    * tools::buildVignettes() has a new argument skip, which is used by
      R CMD check to skip (and note) vignettes with unavailable
      \VignetteDepends (PR#18318).

    * New generic .AtNames() added to enable class-specific completions
      after @. The formerly internal function findMatches() is now
      exported, mainly for use in methods for .DollarNames() and
      .AtNames().

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

    * default.stringsAsFactors() is defunct.

    * Calling as.data.frame.<class>() directly (for 12 atomic classes)
      is going to be formally deprecated, currently activated by
      setting the environment variable
      _R_CHECK_AS_DATA_FRAME_EXPLICIT_METHOD_ to non-empty, which also
      happens in R CMD check --as-cran.

  BUG FIXES:

    * Hashed environments with sizes less than 5 can now grow.
      (Reported to R-devel by Duncan Garmonsway.)

    * as.character(<Rd>, deparse = TRUE) failed to re-escape curly
      braces in LaTeX-like text.  (Reported by Hadley Wickham in
      PR#18324.)

    * library() now passes its lib.loc argument when requiring Depends
      packages; reported (with fix) in PR#18331 by Mikael Jagan.

    * R CMD Stangle: improved message about 'Output' files.

    * head(x, n) and tail(x, n) now signal an error if n is not
      numeric, instead of incidentally "working" sometimes returning
      all of x.  Reported and discussed by Colin Fay, in PR#18357.

    * The "lm" method for summary() now gives the correct F-statistic
      when the model contains an offset.  Reported in PR#18008.

    * C() and `contrasts<-`() now preserve factor level names when
      given a function object (as opposed a function name which did
      preserve names). Reported in PR#17616.

    * c(a = 1, 2)[[]] no longer matches 2 but rather signals a
      _classed_ error.  Reported and analysed by Davis Vaughan in
      PR#18367, a duplicate of PR#18004, by Jan Meis et al.  For
      consistency, NULL[[]] is also erroneous now.  x[[]] <- v gives an
      error of the same class "MissingSubscriptError".

    * The relist() function of utils now supports NULL elements in the
      skeleton (PR#15854).

    * ordered(levels = *) (missing x) now works analogously to factor(,
      ordered=TRUE); reported (with fix) by Achim Zeileis in PR#18389.

    * User-defined Rd macro definitions can now span multiple lines,
      thanks to a patch from Duncan Murdoch. Previously, the Rd parser
      silently ignored everything after the first line.

    * Plain-text help (tools::Rd2txt()) now preserves an initial blank
      line for text following description list items.

    * tools::Rd2HTML() and tools::Rd2latex() no longer split \arguments
      and \value lists at Rd comments.

    * tools::Rd2latex() now correctly handles optional text outside
      \items of argument lists as well as bracketed text at the
      beginning of sections, e.g., \value{[NULL]}.

    * as.character(<POSIXt>) now behaves more in line with the methods
      for atomic vectors such as numbers, and is no longer influenced
      by options().  Ditto for as.character(<Date>).  The
      as.character() method gets arguments digits and OutDec with
      defaults _not_ depending on options().  Use of as.character(*,
      format = .) now warns.

    * Similarly, the as.character.hexmode() and *.octmode() methods
      also behave as good citizen methods and back compatibility option
      keepStr = TRUE.

    * The as.POSIXlt(<POSIXlt>) and as.POSIXct(<POSIXct>) default
      methods now do obey their tz argument, also in this case.

    * as.POSIXlt(<Date>) now does apply a tz (time zone) argument, as
      does as.POSIXct(); partly suggested by Roland Fuss on the R-devel
      mailing list.

    * as.Date.POSIXlt(x) now also works when the list components are of
      unequal length, aka "partially filled" or "ragged".

    * expand.model.frame() looked up variables in the wrong environment
      when applied to models fitted without data.  Reported in
      PR#18414.

    * time() now (also) uses the ts.eps = getOption("ts.eps") argument
      and thus by default rounds values very close to the start (or
      end) of a year.  Based on a proposal by Andre"i V. Kostyrka on
      R-help.

    * Printing of a factanal() result with just one factor and sort =
      TRUE now works regularly, fixing PR#17863 by Timothy Bates,
      thanks to the 'R Contributors' working group.

    * Printing 0-length objects of class "factor", "roman", "hexmode",
      "octmode", "person", "bibentry", or "citation" now prints
      something better, one of which fixes PR#18422, reported by
      Benjamin Feakins.

    * Sys.timezone() queries timedatectl only if systemd is loaded;
      addressing a report by Jan Gorecki in PR#17421.

    * The formula method of cor.test() had scoping problems when
      environment(formula) was not the calling environment; reported
      with a patch proposal by Mao Kobayashi in PR#18439.

    * attach() of an environment with active bindings now preserves the
      active bindings.  Reported by Kevin Ushey in PR#18425.

    * BLAS detection now works also with system-provided libraries not
      available as regular files.  This fixes detection of the
      Accelerate framework on macOS since Big Sur.  Reported by David
      Novgorodsky.

    * download.file() gives a helpful error message in case of an
      invalid download.file.method option, thanks to Colin Fay's report
      in PR#18455.

    * Sporadic crashes of Rterm when using completion have been fixed.

    * Rprof() is now more reliable.  A livelock in thread
      initialization with too short sampling interval has been fixed on
      macOS.  A deadlock in using the C runtime has been fixed on
      Windows.  A potential deadlock has been prevented on Unix.

    * Cursor placement in Rgui now works even after a fixed-width font
      is selected.

    * Mandatory options (options()) are now set on startup so that
      saving and restoring them always works (PR#18372).

    * Package installation, R CMD INSTALL or install.packages(*), now
      parses each of the <pkg>/R/*.R files individually instead of
      first concatenating and then parse()ing the large resulting file.
      This allows parser or syntax errors to be diagnosed with correct
      file names and line numbers, thanks to Simon Dedman's report and
      Bill Dunlap's patch in PR#17859.

      This _does_ require syntactically self contained R source files
      now, fixing another inadvertent bug.

    * predict.lm(<model with offset>) now finds the offset in the
      correct environment, thanks to Andr'e Gillibert's report and patch
      in PR#18456.

    * getInitial(<formula>) now finds the selfStart model in the
      correct environment.  (Reported by Ivan Krylov in PR#18368.)

    * Fix for possible segfault when using recently-added graphics
      features, such as gradients, clipping paths, masks, and groups
      with pdf(file=NULL).

    * class(m) <- class(m) no longer changes a matrix m by adding a
      class _attribute_.

    * packageDate(pkg) now only warns once if there is no pkg.

    * When ts() creates a multivariate time series, "mts", it also
      inherits from "array" now, and is.mts() is documented _and_
      stricter.

    * Rd2txt() now preserves line breaks of \verb Rd content and from
      duplicated \cr.  The former also fixes the rendering of verbatim
      output from Rd \Sexpr in plain-text help.

    * uniroot(f, interval) should no longer wrongly converge _outside_
      the interval in some cases where abs(f(x)) == Inf for an x at the
      interval boundary, thanks to posts by Ben Bolker and Serguei
      Sokol on R-devel.

    * Vectorized alpha handling in palette functions such as in gray(),
      rainbow(), or hcl.colors() works correctly now, thanks to Achim
      Zeileis' report and patch in PR#18476.

    * Formatting and print()ing of bibentry objects has dropped the
      deprecated citation.bibtex.max argument, such that the bibtex
      argument's default for print.bibentry() depends directly on the
      citation.bibtex.max option, whereas in format.bibentry() the
      option no longer applies.

    * Attempting to use a character string naming a foreign function
      entry point in a foreign function call in a package will now
      signal an error if the packages has called R_forceSymbols to
      specify that symbols must be used.

    * An error in table() could permanently set options(warn=2)
      promoting all subsequent warnings to errors.

    * The sigma() function gave misleading results for binary GLMs.  A
      new method for objects of class "glm" returns the square root of
      the estimate of the dispersion parameter using the same
      calculation as summary.glm().

    * bs() and ns() in the (typical) case of automatic knot
      construction, when some of the supposedly inner knots coincide
      with boundary knots, now moves them inside (with a warning),
      building on PR#18442 by Ben Bolker.

    * R CMD on Windows now skips the site profile with --no-site-file
      and --vanilla even when R_PROFILE is set (PR#18512, from Kevin
      Ushey).

I have been trying to write the code for the CCM analysis that you used in
your study, but unfortunately, I haven't been able to write it. I was
wondering if you would be willing to share the code with me. I understand
that the code may be your intellectual property, but I assure you that I
will use it solely for academic and non-commercial purposes.

If you are able to share the code, I would greatly appreciate it. The code
will be a valuable resource for me to understand the implementation details
and reproduce the results of your study. Alternatively, if you are unable
to share the code, I would be grateful for any guidance or suggestions you
can provide in implementing the CCM analysis using the rEDM and
multispatialCCM packages.

Thank you very much for your consideration. I look forward to your positive
response.

Best regards,
Yeswanth.

You seem to be referring to a specific publication by a specific

to, it seems very difficult. Perhaps you could supply a reference to

Subject: [R] detect and replace outliers by the average
In-Reply-To: <CAE9stmf7_W=5byB3f_N+3+_C2penGqcxqnMm45fY+WGJNombRQ@mail.gmail.com>
References: <CAE9stmf7_W=5byB3f_N+3+_C2penGqcxqnMm45fY+WGJNombRQ@mail.gmail.com>

This can be seen as three steps:
(1) identify outliers
(2) replace them with NA (trivial)
(3) impute missing values.
There are packages for imputing missing data.

Here I just want to address the first step.
An observation is only an outlier relative to some model.
Outliers can indicate
- data that are just wrong (data entry error, failing battery in measurement
  device, all sorts of stuff).  In this case, deletion + imputation makes
  sense.
- data that are generated by a mixture of two or more processes,
  not the single process you thought was there.  In this case,
  deletion + imputation is dangerous.  The world is trying to tell
  you something and you are ignoring it.
- the model is wrong.  Here again, deletion + imputation is
  dangerous.  You need a better model.

"Detecting outliers in R" as a web query turned up
https://statsandr.com/blog/outliers-detection-in-r/
on the first page of results.  There's plenty of material
about finding outliers.

But please give very VERY serious consideration to the
possibility that some or even all of your outliers are
actually GOOD data telling you something you need to know.

What does it mean when one column is just blank, neither a
number nor NA, just nothing?

Sometimes outliers happen. No matter the sample size there is always the possibility that one or more values are correct though highly improbable.

[External Email]

This can be seen as three steps:
(1) identify outliers
(2) replace them with NA (trivial)
(3) impute missing values.
There are packages for imputing missing data.
See
https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/03/tutorial-powerful-packages-imputing-missing-values/

Here I just want to address the first step.
An observation is only an outlier relative to some model.
Outliers can indicate
- data that are just wrong (data entry error, failing battery in measurement
  device, all sorts of stuff).  In this case, deletion + imputation makes
  sense.
- data that are generated by a mixture of two or more processes,
  not the single process you thought was there.  In this case,
  deletion + imputation is dangerous.  The world is trying to tell
  you something and you are ignoring it.
- the model is wrong.  Here again, deletion + imputation is
  dangerous.  You need a better model.

I installed R-4.3.0 in Debian 11 Linux and wish to plot elevation data 
perspectives.

install.packages('elevatr') completes successfully, but "Error: object 
'get_elev_raster' not found" is a problem.

How to solve, please?

Did you load the package using library(elevatr) after installing it?

Alternatively, elevatr::get_elev_raster should also work.

 ?Thank you, I realized my library(elevatr) omission shortly shortly

Dear R-experts,

How to solve that problem?

My R version is 4.2.1

Here below trying to install RGBL library found here :?https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RBGL.html

So, I run this R code :

if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
????install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("RBGL")


Here is what I get :

> if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
+ install.packages("BiocManager")
Bioconductor version 3.16 (BiocManager 1.30.20), R 4.2.1 (2022-06-23)
>
> BiocManager::install("RBGL")
Bioconductor version 3.16 (BiocManager 1.30.20), R 4.2.1 (2022-06-23)
Warning message:
package(s) not installed when version(s) same as or greater than current; use `force = TRUE` to re-install: 'RBGL'

The problem is that I am trying to run this R code :
https://github.com/dmalinsk/lv-ida/blob/master/example.R

?
So I run :

library(pcalg)
library(igraph)
library(RBGL)
source("lvida.R")


Here is what I get :

source("lvida.R")
Error in file(filename, "r", encoding = encoding) :
? cannot open the connection
In addition: Warning message:
In file(filename, "r", encoding = encoding) :
? cannot open file 'lvida.R': No such file or directory

So, I guess the problem is coming from the source not from the libraries? How to solve that problem?

Best,

Is lvida.R in your working directory?
Try using the full path name to the file instead in source()

Is lvida.R in your working directory?
Try using the full path name to the file instead in source()

Me again ! How to solve this?

At the end of this page there is the installation command :
https://gitlab.science.ru.nl/gbucur/RUcausal/-/blob/master/README.Rmd

Working with a MAC, I have tried to install the RUcausal library (copy and paste the installation command).

It is written that the package has been built on Linux using the GNU Compiler Collection. To install the package, open an R instance and run:
install.packages('devtools') # required package
devtools::install_git('https://gitlab.science.ru.nl/gbucur/RUcausal')

I get this error message :

? ERROR: package installation failed
Error: Failed to install 'RUcausal' from Git:
? ! System command 'R' failed

For Mac-related problems, try r-sig-mac at r-project.org.

It may be that you need a working Fortran compiler too (see
<https://mac.r-project.org/tools/> on how to obtain it). I could be
mistaken about it, though.

Perhaps read the Posting Guide, note that there is a special mailing list for MacOSX-specific questions, and post there instead?

You don't appear to have installed gfortran. I am aware that there are specific instructions for getting that installed in MacOS that you need to find and follow [1].
