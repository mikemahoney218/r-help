Reasons for preferring one to another:
 - taste.
   If you like curly braces, you'll prefer R.
   If you like indentation forced by syntax, you'll prefer Python.
 - compatibility.
   This morning I was trying to use a web site where all the Python
   examples were non-functional due to either of both of two changes
   to Python syntax.
 - tooling
   Both have pretty good tools.  For some things, R has the edge.
   For some, Python.  (There is no R analogue of PyPy.)
 - packages
   Both R and Python have vast libraries of contributed packages.
   Quite often you are more interested in a package than the language
   it runs in.  You might be surprised at what is available for R.
   Tensorflow: https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/
   Keras: https://keras.rstudio.com/

And of course, some people use both in the same project,
https://www.rstudio.com/solutions/r-and-python/

By the way, someone said that R is purely interpreted.
That's not completely true.  In R, type
?compile
>From .py files you get .pyc, from .R files you get .Rc

If you are looking for expertise in answering questions about NumPy, the pool of experts will be smaller here than in a forum whose topic is NumPy. 

I don't know what "BIO" means... if it alludes to biostatistics then there is a whole separate Bioconductor project that specializes in applying R to that category of problem.  Having a large pool of people building tools that you can use and answer questions about should count for something... but they do have their own forums dedicated to that specialty.

Message-ID: <C893C950-C99E-4931-9481-095FB0115737@gmail.com>

The build system rolled up R-4.1.2.tar.gz (codename "Bird Hippie") this morning.

The list below details the changes in this release. 

You can get the source code from

https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4/R-4.1.2.tar.gz

or wait for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site nearer to you.

Binaries for various platforms will appear in due course.

This is the relevant part of the NEWS file

CHANGES IN R 4.1.2:

  C-LEVEL FACILITIES:

    * The workaround in headers R.h and Rmath.h (using namespace std;)
      for the Oracle Developer Studio compiler is no longer needed now
      C++11 is required so has been removed.  A couple more usages of
      log() (which should have been std::log()) with an int argument
      are reported on Solaris.

    * The undocumented limit of 4095 bytes on messages from the
      S-compatibility macros PROBLEM and MESSAGE is now documented and
      longer messages will be silently truncated rather than
      potentially causing segfaults.

    * If the R_NO_SEGV_HANDLER environment variable is non-empty, the
      signal handler for SEGV/ILL/BUS signals (which offers recovery
      user interface) is not set. This allows more reliable debugging
      of crashes that involve the console.

  DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT:

    * The legacy S-compatibility macros PROBLEM, MESSAGE, ERROR, WARN,
      WARNING, RECOVER, ... are deprecated and will be hidden in R
      4.2.0. R's native interface of Rf_error and Rf_warning has long
      been preferred.

  BUG FIXES:

    * .mapply(F, dots, .) no longer segfaults when dots is not a list
      and uses match.fun(F) as always documented; reported by Andrew
      Simmons in PR#18164.

    * hist(<Date>, ...) and hist(<POSIXt>, ...)  no longer pass
      arguments for rect() (such as col and density) to axis().
      (Thanks to Sebastian Meyer's PR#18171.)

    * \Sexpr{ch} now preserves Encoding(ch). (Thanks to report and
      patch by Jeroen Ooms in PR#18152.)

    * Setting the RNG to "Marsaglia-Multicarry" e.g., by RNGkind(), now
      warns in more places, thanks to Andr'e Gillibert's report and
      patch in PR#18168.

    * gray(numeric(), alpha=1/2) no longer segfaults, fixing PR#18183,
      reported by Till Krenz.

    * Fixed dnbinom(x, size=<very_small>, .., log=TRUE) regression,
      reported by Martin Morgan.

    * as.Date.POSIXlt(x) now keeps names(x), thanks to Davis Vaughan's
      report and patch in PR#18188.

    * model.response() now strips an "AsIs" class typically, thanks to
      Duncan Murdoch's report and other discussants in PR#18190.

    * try() is considerably faster in case of an error and long call,
      as e.g., from some do.call().  Thanks to Alexander Kaever's
      suggestion posted to R-devel.

    * qqline(y = <object>) such as y=I(.), now works, see also
      PR#18190.

    * Non-integer mgp par() settings are now handled correctly in
      axis() and mtext(), thanks to Mikael Jagan and Duncan Murdoch's
      report and suggestion in PR#18194.

    * formatC(x) returns length zero character() now, rather than ""
      when x is of length zero, as documented, thanks to Davis
      Vaughan's post to R-devel.

    * removeSource(fn) now retains (other) attributes(fn).

Thank you, Mathew!

As to your question on how/where to report a bug etc,
as we actually *do* count the documentation inside the sources,
notably the help files, as part of R in the sense of 'bug'.
We have a careful (sometimes too detailed) page on the topic:
   https://www.r-project.org/bugs.html

Still, in such cases, the most efficient -- but not always available --
approach is to privately contact a member of the R core team
with the typo to be fixed, so it will happen swiftly and not
many people need to spend time with it.
 -> https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html

Another possible venue may be to contact the  'R Contribution'
working group  --> https://forwards.github.io/rcontribution/
of which several experienced members would know how to
efficiently address this.

.. and yes, I've added the missing "be" now ... but (of course) not in time
for the release of   R 4.1.2   which is planned for today.

Hello,?

I wanted to ask if it is possible to have a data visualization of the following kind in R??
It is not exactly a graph; a series of bubbles that have an area corresponding to the percentage inside it arranged in a row.?
Thank you!?

... a simple web search on "bubble plots R" (what else?) would have brought
up many relevant hits. One should always try such obvious "homework" before
posting here. Better and quicker info often results.

Subject: [R] tidyverse: read_csv() misses column
Message-ID: <cabf74a6-dc12-ab4a-dad2-4a60a56ac6b4@appl-ecosys.com>

The data file, cor-disc.csv begins with:
site_nbr,year,mon,day,hr,min,tz,disc
14171600,2009,10,23,00,00,PDT,8750

The first 7 columns are character strings; the 8th column is an integer.

After loading library(tidyverse) I ran read_csv() with this result:
> cor_disc <- read_csv("../data/cor-disc.csv")
                                                                                                     Rows: 
415263 Columns: 8
?? Column specification 
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Delimiter: ","
chr (5): mon, day, hr, min, tz
dbl (2): site_nbr, year

? Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
? Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this 
message.

1. What happed to the values in column 'disc?'

2. Why are site_nbr and year seen as doubles when they're character strings?

I've not found answers in the book or in ?read_csv.

What am I missing?

I do not have a specific answer to your particular problem. All I can say is when a CSV import doesn?t work, it can mean there is something in the CSV file that is unexpected. When read_csv() fails, I will try read.csv() to compare the results.

Kevin,

That's a thought. I'll do that.

So, where might I look to see why tidyverse's read_csv() doesn't produce the
same results?

More explicitly... look at rows past the first row. If your csv has 300 rows and column 1 has something non-numeric in row 299 then the whole column gets imported as character data. Try

cor_disc[[ 1 ]] |> as.numeric() |> is.na() |> where()

to find suspect rows. You may want to read about the na argument to read_csv in ?read_csv.

Jeff,

cor_disc has 415264 rows.

> cor_disc[[ 1 ]] |> as.numeric() |> is.na() |> where()
Error in where(is.na(as.numeric(cor_disc[[1]]))) :
   could not find function "where"

Searching for 'where' in ?read_csv finds only
where each character represents one column:

And, if there was such a non-numeric in any row of column 1 wouldn't
read.csv() also catch it and throw an error?

Thanks,

Rich

Use the col_type argument to specify your column types.  [Why would you
expect '2009' to be read as a string instead of a number?].  It looks like
an
initial zero causes an otherwise numeric looking entry to be considered
a string (handy for zip codes in the northeastern US).

help(read_csv) says the column type guessing is "not robust" and its
algorithm
doesn't seem to be documented in the help file:

col_types

One of NULL, a cols() specification, or a string. See vignette("readr") for
more details.

If NULL, all column types will be imputed from guess_max rows on the input
interspersed throughout the file. This is convenient (and fast), but not
robust. If the imputation fails, you'll need to increase the guess_max or
supply the correct types yourself.

Jeff,

That problem's resolved; problems() found the lines.

Question:

> cor_disc
# A tibble: 415,263 ? 8
    site_nbr  year mon   day   hr    min   tz     disc
    <chr>    <dbl> <chr> <chr> <chr> <chr> <chr> <dbl>
  1 14171600  2009 10    23    00    00    PDT    8750

While not seen in this message, the 2 in year and the 8 in disc are
underlined. Why is that? I assume it indicates the value is numeric but I
defined the type for each column as "c" and "i", respectively.

Regards,

Rich

Bill,

That makes sense. I read that in the book and forgot about it. I'll specify
the col_type for each column in the read_csv() function.

Specifying column names got me much closer:

The col_types for year was specified as "c", for disc as "i" but both are
input as doubles. That's a non-issue for disc (discharge in fps), but year
is a character as are months, days, etc.

Have I still missed something in specifying column types?

Thanks, Calum. I didn't see that I mis-counted when adding types.

But, that doesn't change the tibble types for year and disc from doubles to
character and int, respectively.

 Thank you very much, for your time and response!?
This did resolve my issue and I apologize if the question was a little too straightforward - I did try to create bubble plots in excel but that did not work, hence, I asked here since it is more of a diagram and less of a plot. Thank you very much for your time and help!?

Have you spent time with any R tutorials? Your queries are really
elementary, and this list really cannot serve as a tutorial service. See
the Posting Guide linked below for what help you can expect here ... and
how to post queries that will get that help.

"For questions about functions in standard packages distributed with R (see

questions on R-help.
If the question relates to a *contributed package* , e.g., one downloaded

find("functionname") and packageDescription("packagename") to find this
information. *Only* send such questions to R-help or R-devel if you get no
reply or need further assistance. This applies to both requests for help
and to bug reports."

Calum,

No parentheses. Example:
14171600,2009,10,23,05,15,PDT,8710
14171600,2009,10,23,05,30,PDT,8710

Which causes another question. If I work within the tidyverse should I
mutate the year, month, day, hour, and minute to a datetime (using mutate())
rather than having separate columns for each component?

Thanks,

Rich

Hi All,

How can I generate mean by group. The sample data looks like as follow,
dat<-read.table(text="Year Sex wt
2001 M 15
2001 M 14
2001 M 16
2001 F 12
2001 F 11
2001 F 13

2002 M 18
2002 M 17
2002 F 11
2002 F 15
2002 F 14
2003 M 18
2003 M 13
2003 M 14
2003 F 15
2003 F 10
2003 F 11  ",header=TRUE)

The desired  output  is,
             M        F
2001    15        12
2002    16.33   13.33
2003    15          12

I would usually use 'tapply'. It splits an object into groups, performs
some function on each group, and then (optionally) converts the input to
something simpler.
For example:


tapply(dat$wt, dat$Year, mean)  # mean by Year
tapply(dat$wt, dat$Sex , mean)  # mean by Sex
tapply(dat$wt, list(dat$Year, dat$Sex), mean)  # mean by Year and Sex


The documentation ?tapply has many more details about how this works, but
that's the basics at least. I hope this helps!

Hi Alice,
I can see from your two questions that your English is a bit shaky.
This is not a criticism, I couldn't speak Chinese to save my life. I
looked around for a Chinese R help mailing list and couldn't find one.
Perhaps someone else knows of one. Not only would it make your life
easier at the moment, but it may help you learning R jargon in
English.

Hi Val,
I think you answered your own question:

Calum,

I thought that I had it working, but I'm still missing a piece.

For example,

This is a fairly simple request and well covered by introductory reading
material.

A decent example was given and I see Andrew provided a base R reply that
should be sufficient. But I do not think he realized you wanted something
different so his answer is not in the format you wanted:

> tapply(dat$wt, dat$Year, mean)  # mean by Year 
2001     2002     2003 
13.50000 14.83333 13.50000 
> tapply(dat$wt, dat$Sex , mean)  # mean by Sex tapply(dat$wt,
list(dat$Year, dat$Sex), mean)  # mean by Year and Sex
F        M
12.44444 15.44444

I personally often prefer to the tidyverse approach which optionally
includes pipes and allows a data frame to be grouped any way you want and
followed by commands. It is easier to output your result this way by
grouping BOTH by Year and Sex at once and getting multiple lines of output.
Note the code below requires a line once like install.packages("tidyverse)

library(tidyverse)
dat <- read.table(
  text = "Year Sex wt
2001 M 15
2001 M 14
2001 M 16
2001 F 12
2001 F 11
2001 F 13
2002 M 14
2002 M 18
2002 M 17
2002 F 11
2002 F 15
2002 F 14
2003 M 18
2003 M 13
2003 M 14
2003 F 15
2003 F 10
2003 F 11  ",
  header = TRUE
)

dat %>%
  group_by(Year, Sex) %>%
  summarize( M = mean(wt, na.rm=TRUE))

The output of the above is the rows below:

> dat %>%
  +   group_by(Year, Sex) %>%
  +   summarize( M = mean(wt, na.rm=TRUE))
`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Year'. You can override using the
`.groups` argument.
# A tibble: 6 x 3
# Groups:   Year [3]
Year Sex       M
<int> <chr> <dbl>
  1  2001 F      12  
2  2001 M      15  
3  2002 F      13.3
4  2002 M      16.3
5  2003 F      12  
6  2003 M      15  

Note Male and Female have their own rows. It is not that hard to switch it
to your format by rearranging the intermediate data set with pivot_wider()
in the pipeline asking to make multiple new columns from variable Sex and
populating them from the created variable M. The new complete pipeline is
now:

dat %>%
  group_by(Year, Sex) %>%
  summarize( M = mean(wt, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Sex, values_from = M)

The output as a tibble is:

Year     F     M
<int> <dbl> <dbl>
  1  2001  12    15  
2  2002  13.3  16.3
3  2003  12    15  

Or as a data.frame which seems to add zeroes:

dat %>%
  +   group_by(Year, Sex) %>%
  +   summarize( M = mean(wt, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  +   pivot_wider(names_from = Sex, values_from = M) %>%
  +   as.data.frame
`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Year'. You can override using the
`.groups` argument.
Year        F        M
1 2001 12.00000 15.00000
2 2002 13.33333 16.33333
3 2003 12.00000 15.00000

Your expected output is too rounded as it expects 13.3 and 16.3 but if you
insist on a single significant digit after the decimal point, ask for it to
be rounded:

> dat %>%
  +   group_by(Year, Sex) %>%
  +   summarize( M = mean(wt, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  +   pivot_wider(names_from = Sex, values_from = M) %>%
  +   as.data.frame %>%
  +   round(1)
`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Year'. You can override using the
`.groups` argument.
Year    F    M
1 2001 12.0 15.0
2 2002 13.3 16.3
3 2003 12.0 15.0

And, yes, any of the above can be done in various ways using plain old R,
and especially in the recent versions that have added a somewhat different
way to do pipelines.

Hi All,

How can I generate mean by group. The sample data looks like as follow,
dat<-read.table(text="Year Sex wt
2001 M 15
2001 M 14
2001 M 16
2001 F 12
2001 F 11
2001 F 13
2002 M 14
2002 M 18
2002 M 17
2002 F 11
2002 F 15
2002 F 14
2003 M 18
2003 M 13
2003 M 14
2003 F 15
2003 F 10
2003 F 11  ",header=TRUE)

The desired  output  is,
             M        F
2001    15        12
2002    16.33   13.33
2003    15          12

Jim,

Your code gives the output in quite a different format and as an object of
class "by" that is not easily convertible to a data.frame. So, yes, it is an
answer that produces the right numbers but not in the places or data
structures I think they (or if it is HW ...) wanted.

Trivial standard cases are often handled by a single step but more complex
ones often suggest a multi-part approach.

Of course Val gets to decide what approach works best for them within
whatever constraints we here are not made aware of. If this is a class
assignment, it likely would be using only tools discussed in the class. So I
would not suggest using a dplyr/tidyverse approach if that is not covered or
even part of a class. If this is a project in the real world, it becomes a
matter of programming taste and convenience and so on.

Maybe Val can share more about the situation so we can see what is helpful
and what is not. Realistically, I can think of way too many ways to get the
required output.

Thank you all!
I can assure you that this is not  HW. This is a sample of my large
data set and I want a simple  and efficient approach to get the
desired  output   in that particular format.  That file will be saved
and used  as an input file for another external process.

Understood Val. So you need to save the output in something like a data.frame which can then be saved as a CSV file or whatever else makes sense to be read in by a later program. As note by() does not produce the output in a usable way.

But you mentioned efficient, and that is another whole ball of wax. For small amounts of data it may not matter much. And some processes may look slower but turn out be more efficient if compiled as C/C++ or ...

Sometimes it might be more efficient to change the format of your data before the analysis, albeit if the output is much smaller, maybe best later.

Good luck.

Thank you all!
I can assure you that this is not  HW. This is a sample of my large data set and I want a simple  and efficient approach to get the
desired  output   in that particular format.  That file will be saved
and used  as an input file for another external process.

Thank you Avi,

One question, I am getting this  error from this script

> dat %>%
+   +   group_by(Year, Sex) %>%
+   +   summarize( M = mean(wt, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
+   +   pivot_wider(names_from = Sex, values_from = M) %>%
+   +   as.data.frame %>%
+   +   round(1)
Error in group_by(Year, Sex) : object 'Year' not found
Why I am getting this?

I sent Val a longer reply but for anyone else here, please note Val was copying my OUTPUT with continuation lines starting with plus so of course that has issues! 

The naked code to use was this:

dat %>%
  group_by(Year, Sex) %>%
  summarize( M = mean(wt, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Sex, values_from = M) %>%
  as.data.frame %>%
  round(1)

"A decent example was given and I see Andrew provided a base R reply that
should be sufficient. But I do not think he realized you wanted something
different so his answer is not in the format you wanted:"

Yes, but it is trivial to modify Andrew's suggestion to get almost exactly
what Val has requested (one merely needs to read ?tapply carefully) without
having to resort to tidyverse gymnastics:

> d <- with(dat, tapply(wt, list(Year, Sex), mean))
> d
            F        M
2001 12.00000 15.00000
2002 13.33333 16.33333
2003 12.00000 15.00000

This is a matrix, not a data.frame. write() or write.table()  can be used
to write it to a file in whatever format is desired (e.g. with or without
row,column names. Etc.

Cheers,
Bert

Dear Val,

also consider using reshape2::dcast

	dat <- structure(list(Year = c(2001L,
	2001L, 2001L, 2001L, 2001L, 2001L,
	2002L, 2002L, 2002L, 2002L, 2002L,
	2002L, 2003L, 2003L, 2003L, 2003L,
	2003L, 2003L), Sex = c("M", "M", "M",
	"F", "F", "F", "M", "M", "M", "F", "F",
	"F", "M", "M", "M", "F", "F", "F"), wt =
	c(15L, 14L, 16L, 12L, 11L, 13L, 14L,
	18L, 17L, 11L, 15L, 14L, 18L, 13L, 14L,
	15L, 10L, 11L)), class = "data.frame",
	row.names = c(NA, -18L))
	
	reshape2::dcast(data=dat,
	                formula=Year~Sex,
	                value.var="wt",
	                fun.aggregate=mean)

yielding

	  Year        F        M
	1 2001 12.00000 15.00000
	2 2002 13.33333 16.33333
	3 2003 12.00000 15.00000

Best,
Rasmus

That works, Bert. I do note the result, d, is a matrix and works because everything within it is numeric. I have no problem with that for this problem.

 

For a more general problem with a data.frame type of object with columns of any type, the proper output might better be a data.frame. Of course, in this case, the matric can easily be coerced back into a data.frame:

 

d <- as.data.frame(with(dat, tapply(wt, list(Year, Sex), mean)))

d

 

F        M

2001 12.00000 15.00000

2002 13.33333 16.33333

2003 12.00000 15.00000

 

str(d)

 

'data.frame':      3 obs. of  2 variables:

  $ F: num  12 13.3 12

$ M: num  15 16.3 15

"A decent example was given and I see Andrew provided a base R reply that
should be sufficient. But I do not think he realized you wanted something
different so his answer is not in the format you wanted:"

 

Yes, but it is trivial to modify Andrew's suggestion to get almost exactly what Val has requested (one merely needs to read ?tapply carefully) without having to resort to tidyverse gymnastics:

 

> d <- with(dat, tapply(wt, list(Year, Sex), mean))
> d
            F        M
2001 12.00000 15.00000
2002 13.33333 16.33333
2003 12.00000 15.00000

 

This is a matrix, not a data.frame. write() or write.table()  can be used to write it to a file in whatever format is desired (e.g. with or without row,column names. Etc.

 

Cheers,

Bert

I can assure you that this is not  HW. This is a sample of my large
data set and I want a simple  and efficient approach to get the
desired  output   in that particular format.  That file will be saved
and used  as an input file for another external process.

... maybe not. According to Rdocumentation.org:

reshape2's status is:

reshape2 is retired: only changes necessary to keep it on CRAN will be
made. We recommend using tidyr <http://tidyr.tidyverse.org/> instead.

Dear Jim and others,

(One of my colleagues pointed me in this direction)

I think the following is the problem that I am experiencing:-

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-security-excerpt/5.7/en/problems-connecting.html

The above says :

Some permanent solutions are:

Determine what is wrong with your DNS server and fix it.

Specify IP addresses rather than host names in the MySQL grant tables.

I could NOT determine what is wrong with my DNS server. If someone
here knows how to do that please do share with me. However, I
specified the IP address in place of the host name and that seems to
be working fine.

Best,
Ashim

Is this, what you are looking for:

x <- c("a","b","c")
lettersnum <- 1:length(letters[])
names(lettersnum) <- letters[]
lettersnum[x]
 > lettersnum[x]
a b c
1 2 3

That's because mutate() doesn't, well, mutate its argument. It _returns_
its changes, but it doesn't save them in the original variable. It's
your responsibility to assign the result somewhere:

cor_disc |> select(...) |> mutate(...) -> cor_disc_mutated

(Idiomatic R makes it hard to accidentally change the value of the
variable passed to a function from inside of that function. Anything
short of environments, reference class objects and/or non-standard
evaluation will not affect the value outside the function call.)

i'm not sure if the following is obviously better, but one might do

a b c
1 2 3

You are right - match seems obviously better, but why not do

x <- c("a","b","c")
match(x, letters[])

I know this is a newbie question. But how do I implement the hash structure
which is available in other languages (in python it's dict)?

I know there is the list, but list's names can be duplicated here.

> x <- list(x=1:5,y=month.name,x=3:7)

> x

$x

[1] 1 2 3 4 5


$y

 [1] "January"   "February"  "March"     "April"     "May"       "June"

 [7] "July"      "August"    "September" "October"   "November"  "December"


$x

[1] 3 4 5 6 7



Thanks a lot.

One choice is
new.env(hash=TRUE)
in the base package

True, but in a lot of cases where a python user might use a dict an R 
user will probably use a list; or when we are talking about arrays of 
dicts in python, the R solution will probably be a data.frame (with each 
dict field in a separate column).

But for data.frame the colnames can be duplicated. Am I right?

Hi

Although you got several answers, simple aggregate was omitted.

As Eric said, the environment comes pretty close.  One difference 
between lists and environments is that environments are reference 
objects, so this changes e1$x:

   e1 <- new.env()
   e1$x <- 1
   e2 <- e1
   e2$x <- 2

Lists are not reference objects, so this doesn't change l1$x:

   l1 <- list()
   l1$x <- 1
   l2 <- l1
   l2$x <- 2

I don't know which behaviour you'd feel more comfortable with. 
Reference objects are pretty rare in R, so some R programmers would be 
surprised by the environment behaviour.  But in other languages they're 
more common, so maybe newbies would be more surprised by the list behaviour.

Another difference betwee environments and lists is how they handle 
assignments of NULL:

   e1$y <- NULL   # sets e1$y to NULL
   l1$y <- NULL   # does nothing here, would delete l1$y if it existed

I don't like the NULL handling in lists in R, but I'm used to it.

BTW, I don't understand why the possibility of duplicated names is an 
issue.  If you just avoid intentional duplication, you don't get it. 
For example, if instead of this:
> 
>> x <- list(x=1:5,y=month.name,x=3:7)

you do this:

x <- list(x=1:5,y=month.name)
x$x <- 3:7

there is no duplication.  The only (?) ways to get duplication are in 
the initial construction of the list, or by explicit manipulation of the 
names attribute.  So be careful when you do those, and lists can work.

Yes. A data.frame is basically a list where all elements are vectors of 
the same length. So this issue also exists in a data.frame. However, the 
data.frame construction method will detect this and generate unique 
names (which also might not be what you want):

 > data.frame(a=1:3, a=1:3) 
 
 
 
 

   a a.1 
 
 
 
 
                                                                   1 1 
  1 
 
 
 
 
                                                             2 2   2 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                           3 3   3

But still with a little effort you can still create a data.frame with 
multiple columns with the same name. But as Duncan Murdoch mentions you 
can usually control for that.


Best,
Jan

Jim,

Thinking more about the process after logging out for the evening it
occurred to me that I need to select all columns to retain them in the
tibble. I just tried that and, sure enough, that did the job.

Thanks very much,

Rich

Ivan,

I realized this after thinking more about the issue.

By putting all tibble columns in the select stanza the sampdate column was
added to the tibble.

Thanks very much,

As other posters wrote then environments are the solution.
data.frames, vectors and lists are much slower and less useful to use as
key-value pairs.

Here are some code I somethings uses:

cache <- NULL

cache_set <- function(key, value) {
  assign(key, value, envir = cache)
}

cache_reset <- function() {
  cache <<- new.env(TRUE, emptyenv())
}

cache_get <- function(key) {
  get(key, envir = cache, inherits = FALSE)
}

cache_has_key <- function(key) {
  exists(key, envir = cache, inherits = FALSE)
}
cache_reset()

If you're thinking about using environments, I would suggest you initialize
them like


x <- new.env(parent = emptyenv())


Since environments have parent environments, it means that requesting a
value from that environment can actually return the value stored in a
parent environment (this isn't an issue for [[ or $, this is exclusively an
issue with assign, get, and exists)
Or, if you've already got your values stored in a list that you want to
turn into an environment:


x <- list2env(listOfValues, parent = emptyenv())


Hope this helps!

Subject: [R] sink() not working as expected
Message-ID: <96b75d27-da9b-ec10-7fd3-731a927358a7@appl-ecosys.com>

I've read ?sink and several web pages about it but it's not working properly
when I have the commands in a script and source() them.

The file:
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

sink('data-summaries.txt')
'corvalis discharge summary\n'
summary(cor_disc)
sd(cor_disc$cfs)
'-----------------\n'
sink()

> source('summary_stats.R')
results in an empty file.

When I enter them line-by-line on the R command line I get output including
multiple lines listing the PWD and ignoring the newline:

[1] "/path/to/PWD"
[1] "corvalis discharge summary\n"
[1] "/path/to/PWD"

What am I doing incorrectly here? I've looked at examples on web pages
without learning where I'm erring.

TIA,

Note that an environment carries a hash table with it, while a named list
does not.  I think that looking up an entry in a list causes a hash table
to be created and thrown away.  Here are some timings involving setting and
getting various numbers of entries in environments and lists.  The times
are roughly linear in n for environments and quadratic for lists.

> vapply(1e3 * 2 ^ (0:6), f, L=new.env(parent=emptyenv()),
FUN.VALUE=NA_real_)
[1] 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.02 0.03 0.06 0.15
> vapply(1e3 * 2 ^ (0:6), f, L=list(), FUN.VALUE=NA_real_)
[1]  0.01  0.03  0.15  0.53  2.66 13.66 56.05
> f
function(n, L, V = sprintf("V%07d", sample(n, replace=TRUE))) {
    system.time(for(v in V)L[[v]]<-c(L[[v]],v))["elapsed"]
}

Note that environments do not allow an element named "" (the empty string).

Elements named NA_character_ are treated differently in environments and
lists, neither of which is great.  You may want your hash table functions
to deal with oddball names explicitly.

You probably want to use cat and print for these lines. These things won't
print when not run at the top level, so if you want them to print, you must
specify that.

Andrew,

I modified the file to this:
sink('data-summaries.txt')
cat ('corvalis discharge summary\n')
print(cat)
summary(cor_disc)
sd(cor_disc$cfs)
cat ('-----------------\n')
print(cat)
sink()

and ran it from the R command line:
> sink('data-summaries.txt')
> cat ('corvalis discharge summary\n')
> print(cat)
> summary(cor_disc)
> sd(cor_disc$cfs)
> cat ('-----------------\n')
> print(cat)
> sink()
>

with this output:
corvalis discharge summary
function (..., file = "", sep = " ", fill = FALSE, labels = NULL,
     append = FALSE) 
{
     if (is.character(file))
         if (file == "")
             file <- stdout()
         else if (startsWith(file, "|")) {
             file <- pipe(substring(file, 2L), "w")
             on.exit(close(file))
         }
         else {
             file <- file(file, ifelse(append, "a", "w"))
             on.exit(close(file))
         }
     .Internal(cat(list(...), file, sep, fill, labels, append))
}

What do you think these 2 lines are doing?

cat ('corvalis discharge summary\n')
print(cat)

Please consult ?cat . You might also spend a bit of (more?) time with an R
tutorial or two as you seem confused about how assignment (<-) works. Or
maybe I'm confused about what is confusing you....

Bert,

If I used them in linux cat would display the file (as do more and less) and
print() would be replaced with lpr

Having never before needed to use cat in R, and not seeing it explained in
the one sink() web page, I didn't think to look at the help page.

Now, using cat and not print line-by-line the first set of commands work,
but not the second.

More reading coming up.

In the interactive mode, on the top level of execution, these commands
behave as if you had written

print(sink('data-summaries.txt'))
print('corvalis discharge summary\n')
print(summary(cor_disc))
print(sd(cor_disc$cfs))

instead. When you source() a script, auto-printing is not performed.
This is explained in the first paragraph of ?source, but not ?sink. If
you want to source() scripts and rely on their output (including
sink()), you'll need to print() results explicitly.

cat in R behaves similarly to cat in unix-alikes, sends text to a stdout.
Usually, that stdout would be a file, but usually in R it is the R Console.
I think it might also help to note the difference between cat and print:


x <- "test\n"
cat(x)
print(x)


produces


> cat(x)
test
> print(x)
[1] "test\n"


With that said, wrap each expressions in cat or print depending on which
you want. Also, I would probably add a tryCatch with argument finally as {
    sink()
}
which will guarantee the file connection is severed, even if an error is
raised. Hope this helps

I have several things I considered about this topic.

It is, in general, not possible to do some things in one language or another
even if you find a bridge. Python lets you place all kinds of things into a
dictionary including many static objects like tuples or even other
dictionaries. What is allowed for keys is quite broad. If you use an R
environment or list, there are restrictions on what names are allowed that
are not necessarily the same. 

Now on to key uniqueness. Yes, R allows multiple named entries to share the
same name. But  when I made such a structure, the FIRST instance hides any
later ones when accessing something like list.name$A or setting it. If you
remove an exiting entry by something like setting the above to NULL, though,
the second instance of that name nor becomes the first. So anyone wanting to
fully remove all instances might need to loop till sure all are gone. Not
sure about environments but they may behave better.

Third, multiple parties have built R packages to support hashing including
some no longer available:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hash/hash.pdf
https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Dict/versions/0.10.0

So  if one of those works, why reinvent it?

In any case, if you roll your own, as has been shown by others, you may have
to provide getter and setter functionality and so on to make sure of things
that you want for compatibility and be Careful as any other programs that
can play with your data may go around you.

Finally, someone mentioned how creating a data.frame with duplicate names
for columns is not a problem as it can automagically CHANGE them to be
unique. That is a HUGE problem for using that as a dictionary as the new
name will not be known to the system so all kinds of things will fail.

And there are also packages for many features like sets as well as functions
to manipulate these things.

Subject: Re: [R] Is there a hash data structure for R

Note that an environment carries a hash table with it, while a named list
does not.  I think that looking up an entry in a list causes a hash table to
be created and thrown away.  Here are some timings involving setting and
getting various numbers of entries in environments and lists.  The times are
roughly linear in n for environments and quadratic for lists.

> vapply(1e3 * 2 ^ (0:6), f, L=new.env(parent=emptyenv()),
FUN.VALUE=NA_real_)
[1] 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.02 0.03 0.06 0.15
> vapply(1e3 * 2 ^ (0:6), f, L=list(), FUN.VALUE=NA_real_)
[1]  0.01  0.03  0.15  0.53  2.66 13.66 56.05
> f
function(n, L, V = sprintf("V%07d", sample(n, replace=TRUE))) {
    system.time(for(v in V)L[[v]]<-c(L[[v]],v))["elapsed"] }

Note that environments do not allow an element named "" (the empty string).

Elements named NA_character_ are treated differently in environments and
lists, neither of which is great.  You may want your hash table functions to
deal with oddball names explicitly.

I think you are referring to my remark which was:

I didn't say this means that duplicate names aren't a problem; I just 
mentioned the the behaviour is different. Personally, I would actually 
prefer the behaviour of list (keep the duplicated name) with a warning.

Most of the responses seem to assume that the OP actually wants a hash 
table. Yes, he did ask for that and for a hash table an environment 
(with some work) would be a good option. But in many cases, where other 
languages would use a hash-table-like object (such as a dict) in R you 
would use other types of objects. Furthermore, for many operations where 
you might use hash tables to implement the operation, R has already 
built in options, for example %in%, match, duplicated. These are also 
vectorised; so two vectors: one with keys and one with values might 
actually be faster than an environment in some use cases.

Best,
Jan

Ivan/Andrew,

Thank you both for increasing my knowledge of R. I've not before used sink()
and now I can use it properly. The issues are resolved.

Subject: [R] Fwd: Merging multiple csv files to new file

Hello, I would like to merge 18 csv files into a master data csv file, but
each file has a different number of columns (mostly found in one or more of
the other cvs files) and different number of rows.

I have tried something like the following in R Studio (cloud):

all_data_fit_files <- rbind("dailyActivity_merged.csv",
"dailyCalories_merged.csv", "dailyIntensities_merged.csv",
"dailySteps_merged.csv", "heartrate_seconds_merged.csv",
"hourlyCalories_merged.csv", "hourlyIntensities_merged.csv",
"hourlySteps_merged.csv", "minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged.csv",
"minuteCaloriesWide_merged.csv", "minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged.csv",
"minuteIntensitiesWide_merged.csv", "minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv",
"minuteSleep_merged.csv", "minuteStepsNarrow_merged.csv",
?minuteStepsWide_merged.csv", "sleepDay_merged.csv",
"minuteStepsWide_merged.csv", "sleepDay_merged.csv",
"weightLogInfo_merged.csv")



But I am getting the following error:

Error: unexpected input in "rlySteps_merged.csv",
"minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged.csv", "minuteCaloriesWide_merged.csv",
"minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged.csv",
"minuteIntensitiesWide_merged.csv", "minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv"


(Maybe the R Studio free trial/usage is underpowered for my project?)

Jack, I was agreeing with you and pointing out that although changing names
of columns to be unique has a positive side, it makes it hard to use for
anything that needs to look like either a set or a bag and of course a
dictionary/hash. All the above want to put things in using some identifier
and expect to get back the same.

R actually has other places names can be changed or dynamically created
often with defaults. This can be convenient or annoying as you need to look
at the resulting names to be able to use them. A feature that is nice in
some programs and parts of the tidyverse packages is the ability to specify
things like suffixes to be used.

I use lots of computer languages and keep running into people who expect
another language to just support what the first does. If that were true, we
might not create so many. If your other language supports indefinite sized
integers, good for you. Many others do not and perhaps may not easily do so
even if you try to create your own emulation if some other code gets your
version and does not work on it.

So assuming you use an available package or roll your own and can now make
some kind of hash data structure. As you pointed out, hashing may not be
required if your implementation is already fast and hashing can use lots of
memory. What are the allowed keys in your implementation? Will an integer of
1 be distinct from a floating point of 1.0? Can you hash objects of the
half-dozen or so kinds R seems to have? Whatever your answers are to many
questions like these, you may not get quite the same answers in Python or
PERL or ...

R is not really meant to be a general-purpose language although it can be.
It is not really fully-blown Object Oriented  but in many ways it can be
using newer grafts. So if you need or want the things R is designed for and
in particular there are good packages available for your needs, then use R.
If your needs include things not easily part of R, and you have a language
that works for you, why switch?

I will note that there is an intermediate path. I often run programs in
RSTUDIO that include code for both R and Python. The data structures used
sort of convert back and forth as needed so you can begin in R and read in
data and make some changes and then hand it over to Python for more, perhaps
multiple times, then generate a graph within R or whatever.

So if you want a dictionary, you can sort of keep it on the Python side and
use Python commands to create it and add to it or access contents. The
results may be handed over to the R side as needed but not as a dict but
instead to a pairlist or named list/vector or whatever and when needed, you
can have python take your results. The same applies to lots of other things
Python does that R may not do quite the same or at all. I mean generators
and all kinds of object-oriented programs including multiple inheritance and
so much more. You can use each language for what it is good at or that work
with the way you think and with some overhead get the best of both worlds.

Of course, this comes with costs and any programs you send out to be used by
others would require both languages to be installed properly and ...

Gabrielle,

Why would you expect that to work?

rbind() binds rows of internal R data structures that are some variety of data.frame with exactly the same columns in the same order into a larger object of that type.

You are not providing rbind() with the names of variables holding the info but file names of Comma Separated Values.

If you have many files with different numbers of columns of data with some overlap, you need to decide on quite a few things first. If a file has say 4 columns out of a possible 20 unique columns across the files, do you want to add 16 columns to the contents of the file, after reading it in, and re-arrange it into a specific order by column? What will you fill in the new columns with? NA is a popular choice but you need to decide.

You then need to repeat the same thing with all the other files and read in 6 columns then add 14 filled as you wish and rearrange the columns to the same order.

When done, you have an assortment of variables of class data.frame (or other similar ones) and you can use rbind() on those variables to get a result.

But it may not be what you want. You may actually want more of a database merge type of operation combining columns from each into the same userID field or whatever. rbind() is not the function to do that with and I won't go on to give a long tutorial. 

My main point is what you are doing is at the wrong level. You need to read all the files into variable before doing additional calculations in R.

Subject: [R] Fwd: Merging multiple csv files to new file

Hello, I would like to merge 18 csv files into a master data csv file, but each file has a different number of columns (mostly found in one or more of the other cvs files) and different number of rows.

I have tried something like the following in R Studio (cloud):

all_data_fit_files <- rbind("dailyActivity_merged.csv", "dailyCalories_merged.csv", "dailyIntensities_merged.csv", "dailySteps_merged.csv", "heartrate_seconds_merged.csv", "hourlyCalories_merged.csv", "hourlyIntensities_merged.csv", "hourlySteps_merged.csv", "minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged.csv",
"minuteCaloriesWide_merged.csv", "minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged.csv",
"minuteIntensitiesWide_merged.csv", "minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv", "minuteSleep_merged.csv", "minuteStepsNarrow_merged.csv", ?minuteStepsWide_merged.csv", "sleepDay_merged.csv", "minuteStepsWide_merged.csv", "sleepDay_merged.csv",
"weightLogInfo_merged.csv")



But I am getting the following error:

Error: unexpected input in "rlySteps_merged.csv", "minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged.csv", "minuteCaloriesWide_merged.csv", "minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged.csv",
"minuteIntensitiesWide_merged.csv", "minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv"


(Maybe the R Studio free trial/usage is underpowered for my project?)

1. Think more carefully about the appropriate data structure for what you
wish to do. It's unlikely to be .csv files, however.

In the absence of the above, a simple (but perhaps inappropriate) default
is:

2. Read the files into R and combine into a list.(You will need to read
about lists in R if you don't know what these are, of course).

3. Save your list as an .Rdata file. See ?save and ?load for details. But
do note that such files are special binary files only (easily anyway)
readable by R.

I should have added that once read into R, the collection of data frames
(presumably) can also be saved in one .Rdata file via save() **without**
first combining them into a list. I still prefer keeping them together as
one list in R, but that's up to you.

It might be easier to settle on the desired final csv layout and use Python
to copy the rows via line reads.  Python doesn't care about the data type
in a given "cell", numeric or char, whereas the type errors R would
encounter would make the task very difficult.

The error message arises because you are sometimes delimiting character
strings using non-ASCII open and close double quotes, '?' and '?', instead
of the old-fashioned ones, '"', which have no open or close variants.  This
is a language syntax error, so R didn't try to compute anything.

The others' comments are still valid - you need to read the files named by
these strings to produce R datasets and combine the datasets.

Data type in a CSV is always character until inferred otherwise... it is not necessary nor even easier to manipulate files with Python if you are planning to use R to manipulate the data further with R. Just use the colClasses="character" argument for read.csv.

>(Maybe the R Studio free trial/usage is underpowered for my project?)

- R is a computer language, as well as a program for interpreting R source code.
- RStudio Desktop is an editor with "features" intended to make using R easy. It cannot "do" anything without R being installed.
- R is completely free. There is no "trial" period for using R. There are no "crippled" versions of R.
- RStudio Desktop has both free and paid versions, but they have very nearly identical capabilities. The most significant difference is that you get tech support with the paid version. [1]

So no, your difficulty lies not with what you downloaded but with how you are expressing your desires with the R language (with or without RStudio), and others have suggested ways you could correct that.

I am not clear why Python came up on this forum. Yes, you can do all sorts of stuff in Python (or other languages) in ways similar or not to doing them in R.

The topic here was reading in data from multiple CSV files and I saw no mention about whether some columns are supposed to be of type character or other types.

As noted, if the (CSV) file is properly formatted and whatever function you use to read them in does not guess right, you can use versions of functions that let you specify what type to expect OR change it after you read it in.

One poster seems to be confused and perhaps things what is being read from is some other kind of EXCEL data file. There are other functions that can read from those but I believe a CSV has no real issues unless it is formatted wrong or in ways that require you to ask for comments to be ignored or skip a few lines and so on.

Nontheless, Gabriella needs to spell out a bit more about her project as all we know now is to suggest she read in each file sequentially (or in a loop) into multiple R variables. Beyond that, it is not clear what she wants to do in combining them and I am not so sure an rbind() makes much sense.

So what she needs perhaps is to look at functions like read.csv() and write.csv() and consider what transformations to make in the data read in and then how to recombine them.

Of course, if I have completely misunderstood what she wants, never mind!

Data type in a CSV is always character until inferred otherwise... it is not necessary nor even easier to manipulate files with Python if you are planning to use R to manipulate the data further with R. Just use the colClasses="character" argument for read.csv.

Subject: [R] names.data.frame?
Message-ID: <c7deacf8-c452-128c-9bdb-9904c88f33d8@syonic.eu>

Dear List members,


Is there a way to access the default names() function?


I tried the following:

# Multi-variable polynomial

p = data.frame(x=1:3, coeff=1)

class(p) = c("pm", class(p));


names.pm = function(p) {
# .Primitive("names")(p) # does NOT function
# .Internal("names")(p) # does NOT function
# nms = names.default(p) # does NOT exist
# nms = names.data.frame(p) # does NOT exist
# nms = names(p); # obvious infinite recursion;
nms = names(unclass(p));
}


Alternatively:

Would it be better to use dimnames.pm instead of names.pm?

I am not fully aware of the advantages and disadvantages of dimnames vs 
names.


Sincerely,


Leonard

Subject: [R] What to do when problems() returns nothing
Message-ID: <2e14f7c-e0a0-67d3-66d-c575689fdc6f@appl-ecosys.com>

When I source the import_data.R script now I get errors that tell me to look
at problems(). I enter that function name but there's no return.

Reading ?problems I learned that stop_for_problems(x) should stop the
process when a problem occurs, so I added that function to each data file;
for example,

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

cor_disc <- read_csv("../data/cor-disc.csv", col_names = TRUE,
                      col_types = list (
                          site_nbr = col_character(),
                          year = col_integer(),
                          mon = col_integer(),
                          day = col_integer(),
                          hr = col_double(),
                          min = col_double(),
                          cfs = col_integer())
                      )
stop_for_problems(cor_disc)

running the command, source('input_data.R') produces this result:
> source('import_data.R')
> Error: 415903 parsing failures
> In addition: Warning message:
> One or more parsing issues, see `problems()` for details

When I run the problems() function nothing is returned:
> problems()

What do I read to learn how to identify the problems so I can fix them?

TIA,

Rich

First, your signature for names.pm is wrong. It should look something more
like:


names.pm <- function (x)
{
}


As for the body of the function, you might do something like:


names.pm <- function (x)
{
    NextMethod()
}


but you don't need to define a names method if you're just going to call
the next method. I would suggest not defining a names method at all.


As a side note, I would suggest making your class through the methods
package, with methods::setClass("pm", ...)
See the documentation for setClass for more details, it's the recommended
way to define classes in R.

None of this is for R's *standard* packages. The posting guide, linked
below, says:

"For questions about functions in standard packages distributed with R (see
the FAQ Add-on packages in R
<https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Add-on-packages-in-R>), ask
questions on R-help.
If the question relates to a *contributed package* , e.g., one downloaded
from CRAN, try contacting the package maintainer first. You can also use
find("functionname") and packageDescription("packagename") to find this
information. *Only* send such questions to R-help or R-devel if you get no
reply or need further assistance. This applies to both requests for help
and to bug reports."

More to the point, the tidyverse galaxy tries to largely replace R's
standard functionality and has its own help forum. So I think you should
post there, rather than here, for questions about it:
https://www.tidyverse.org/help/

Bert,

Thank you very much. I am tying to learn tidyverse and had no idea it had
it's own help.

I will post tidyverse questions there.

Ivan,

I've read ?source and still do not understand where to put either auto-print
or an explicit print statement. For example,
cor_disc %>%
     select(site_nbr,year, mon, day, hr, min, tz, cfs) %>%
         mutate(
             sampdt = make_datetime(year, mon, day, hr, min)
             )
print(cor_disc)

throws an error. I also get an error when the print statement follows the
sampdt assignment.

I need to understand how to get a sourced file that's modified (as these
tibbles are by combining data and time columns into a datatime colune) and
saving the tibble with the new appended column.

Hello,

I too would expected NextMethod to work but the following seems to be 
simpler.
"names" is an attribute, so should be accessible with attr.



names.pm = function(p) {
   attr(p, "names")
}

p = data.frame(x=1:3, coeff=1)
class(p) = c("pm", class(p));

names(p)
#[1] "x"     "coeff"



Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

That's incorrect.  It is *a* recommended way to define classes in R, but 
there are other recommended ways as well, for doing other kinds of 
things, and many people stick with the S3 system without formal classes 
at all.

If you're writing a Bioconductor package you should probably use the 
formal methods.  If you're writing code for other purposes, you should 
think about whether you need formal classes at all, and if so, whether 
the methods package formalism is a match for what you're doing.

You do not assign the pipe output, so put the print statement as the 
last instruction of the pipe. The following works.

library(dplyr)

mtcars %>%
   select(mpg, cyl, disp, hp, am) %>%
   mutate(
     sampdt = c("automatic", "manual")[am + 1L]
   ) %>%
   print()


Then, I've just tested it,


source("rhelp.R")


Hope this helps,

That just puts the names together.  You need to read each file, figure 
out how the resulting dataframes get merged (they have different 
columns, so that will take some thinking), and then do it and write it out.

Thank you very much.


Indeed, NextMethod() is the correct way and is working fine.


There are some alternatives (as pointed out). Although I am still trying 
to figure out what would be the best design strategy of such a class.


Note:

- I wanted to exclude the "coeff" column from the returned names;
names.pm = function(p) {
 ?? ?nms = NextMethod();
 ?? ?# excludes the Coefficients:
 ?? ?id = match("coeff", nms);
 ?? ?return(nms[ - id]);
}


This is why I also hesitate regarding what to use: dimnames or names.


Sincerely,


Leonard

Hi Gabrielle,
I get the feeling that you are trying to merge data in which each file
contains different variables, but the same subjects have contributed
the data. This a very wild guess, but it may provide some insight.

# assume that subjects are identified by a variable named "subjectID"
# create a vector of all your filenames
my_filenames<-c("dailyActivity_merged.csv",
"dailyCalories_merged.csv", "dailyIntensities_merged.csv",
...)
# step through the filenames, reading each one and merging it into the
final data frame
for(filename in my_filenames) {
 if(!exists(my_df)) my_df<-read.csv(filename)
 else {
  next_df<-read.csv(filename)
  my_df<-merge(my_df,next_df,by="subjectID",fill=TRUE)
 }
}

I doubt that this will work first time, but it will be a lot easier to
debug than throwing it all into a black box and seeing what comes out.

Jim

Hi,

I am looking for live training that can be conducted via Zoom or another online platform to assist high school teachers and students who are working with R. These teachers and students are using R at a very basic level. They've reviewed a variety of beginner-level texts and videos on R, but they continue to encounter issues that could be resolved in a session with someone who is more familiar with R. I'm not looking for a long-term solution such as a Code Academy course; rather, this session would be intended as a brief beginner's introduction to R as well as a Q&A for specific use cases and troubleshooting. I've searched online for such offerings but have not found anything. If anyone has any advice, I'd appreciate it. Thanks!

Tracy Lenz

Subject: [R] severe bug in LICORS/kmeanspp
Message-ID: <trinity-4b232ca6-7341-43cf-9b55-6002aece90b9-1635977046734@3c-app-webde-bap27>

Hello,

I found a severe bug in the function kmeanspp (k-means++ implementation) in the LICORS package (https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/LICORS/versions/0.2.0/topics/kmeanspp) and need some advice on how to handle this (therefore posting here).
?
Since LICORS has not been updated since 2013, I am not sure if there is an active maintainer. The named maintainer works for Google since 2014 and may have abandoned the package.
?
On the other?hand, this is one of the few implementations of k-means++ in R and coming up first when searching.
?
The bug leads to inferior results.  In its current form, the results were much worse than those of Hartigan-Wong (the default for k-means in the stats package) for all test problems I tried. However, after fixing the bug, kmeanspp found better results than Hartigan-Wong for all those problems. So anyone comparing those two algorithms based on the current implementations in R may have come to the wrong conclusions. BTW: The Hartigan-Wong implementation (Fortran) is *much* faster than LICOR/kmeanspp, which is written in pure R (before making one call to stats/kmeans at the end), but that is not the point here.
?
The bug concerns a distance computation which should be a matrix of distances of all data vectors and all current codebook vectors, but is not. The code and an example illustrating the problem is shown below. Basically, to subtract a vector from a matrix,?one has to convert the vector into a matrix where all rows are just copies of the vector. Details are shown below. The fix is trivial.
?
I stumbled upon this because kmeanspp produced counterintuitive and very poor results.
?
Is this of any interest? Should kmeanspp in LICORS be fixed? I have neither the experience nor the time to take over an R-package. I could write a more formal bug report, if required, but I initially would like to know if this is considered relevant.

Suggestions/comments are welcome.
?
Kind Regards
Bernd Fritzke
?
The code?
? ? ? ? ? ? if (ndim == 1) {
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? dists <- apply(cbind(data[center_ids, ]), 1,?
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? function(center) {
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? rowSums((data - center)^2)
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? })
? ? ? ? ? ? }
? ? ? ? ? ? else {
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? dists <- apply(data[center_ids, ], 1, function(center) {
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? rowSums((data - center)^2)
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? })
? ? ? ? ? ? }
?
should rather be (the two changed lines are marked as "fixed"):
?
? ? ? ? ? ? if (ndim == 1) {
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? dists <- apply(cbind(data[center_ids, ]), 1,?
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? function(center) {
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? rowSums((data - rep(center,each=nrow(data) ) )^2) # fixed
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? })
? ? ? ? ? ? }
? ? ? ? ? ? else {
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? dists <- apply(data[center_ids, ], 1, function(center) {
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? rowSums((data - rep(center,each=nrow(data) ) )^2) # fixed
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? })
? ? ? ? ? ? }
?
Here is some example code illustrating the problem. The code should compute the square distances between the six two-dimensional vectors in "data" and three vectors which happen to be the elements 1, 2, and 4 in "data".
RSTUDIO

```{r}
data=cbind(1:6,rep(0,6))
print("data")
print(data)
center_ids=c(1,2,4)
print("codebook")
print(data[center_ids, ])

# fixed
dists <- apply(data[center_ids, ], 1,?
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?function(center) {
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? rowSums((data - rep(center,each=nrow(data)))^2)
? ? ? ? ? ? ? }
)
print("dists (correct)")
print(dists)

# buggy
dists <- apply(data[center_ids, ], 1,?
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?function(center) {
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? rowSums((data - center)^2)
? ? ? ? ? ? ? }
)
print("buggy dists from LICORS")
dists
```
Output:

In fact, Andrew was paraphrasing some documentation, so his statement

Tracy--

I enjoy doing this sort of thing. Over the years I've done two full-day
"introduction to R" workshops for high school students. The workshops also
inevitably get into software-agnostic, basic issues about how to think

cool. They were in-person, pre-pandemic workshops, but I believe could be

Hi,

The help for problems() shows that the expected argument has a default
value of .Last.value.  If you don't provide the input argument, it just
uses the last thing your R session evaluated.  That's great if you run
problems() right after your issues arises.  But you have inserted
stop_for_problems() before you get a chance to run problems().  So, in your
case, if you want to inspect the problems associated with x, you
should provide x explicitly ala problems(x).

Cheers,
Ben

Ben,

I've isolated one data file to import by removing both stop_for_problems()
and problems():
library(tidyverse)

cor_stage <- read_csv("../data/cor-stage.csv", col_names = TRUE,
                       col_types = list (
                           site_nbr = col_character(),
                           year = col_integer(),
                           mon = col_integer(),
                           day = col_integer(),
                           hr = col_double(),
                           min = col_double(),
                           ft = col_integer())
                       )

The gzipped data file can be downloaded from <https://tinyurl.com/5usc8wbz>.

R imports the file but when I look at it the last column has not been
imported and problems() doesn't return them:

There are 20 .csv files; a few import properly the rest don't. I've not
before needed to import this many data files for a project but using
read.csv() hasn't failed to import the data column, either.

Can someone please explain what Leonard Mada is trying to do? As far as I know, names is not generic and there is no names.data.frame because it?s not needed. (A data.frame seems to be just a named list with some extra functionality that depends on every element being a vector with the same length and some overloading of list functions to ensure that that is always true.) The other answers confused me more.

According to the help page, names() is a generic function.  Running 
`methods(names)` lists quite a few methods, but you're right, there's no 
names.data.frame because it's not needed, the default method is fine.

This seems to work fine for me:


library(readr)
cor_stage_file <- "cor-stage.csv"
cor_stage <- read_csv(cor_stage_file,
 ????????????????????? col_types = list(site_nbr = col_integer(),
 ?????????????????????????????????????? year = col_character(),
 ?????????????????????????????????????? mon = col_character(),
 ?????????????????????????????????????? day = col_character(),
 ?????????????????????????????????????? hr = col_character(),
 ?????????????????????????????????????? min = col_character(),
 ?????????????????????????????????????? tz = col_character(),
 ?????????????????????????????????????? ft = col_double()))

# Add a proper datetime column
date_string <- with(cor_stage, paste(year, mon, day, sep="-"))
time_string <- with(cor_stage, paste(hr, min, "00", sep=":"))
cor_stage['date_time'] <- as.POSIXct(paste(date_string, time_string, 
cor_stage$tz))

Why are you importing the last "ft" column as an integer when it's 
clearly decimal data?

Micha,

Probably because I was still thinking of the discharge data which are
integers. That explains all the issues.

Mea culpa!

Many thanks for seeing what I kept missing,

Other tibbles have doubles in the value column which mean() finds. For
example:

Hello,

Maybe


which(is.na(pdx_stage$ft))


Have you tried na.rm = TRUE?


mean(pdx_stage$ft, na.rm = TRUE)


Hope this helps,

Rui,

I just scrolled through the data file.

Yes, there are severeal NAs when the equipment was down and I hadn't put
na.rm = TRUE in the read_csv() import command.

I hadn't caught them before.

Thanks,

I want to thank all of you for your help the past few days. I now have all
data sets imported, datetime columns added, and distribution stats
calculated for each. No errors.

My searches on the web for what to do when problems() produces no results,
and the few comments on my stackexchange post, were not helpful. So I fell
back on how I debugged FORTRAN code in the 1970s: cut the data file in half
and run that. If the issue still exists, cut that half in half again. Rinse
and repeat until the problem line is found.

It turned out that one 416K line data file had a few double commas between
columns about line 1530 in the file. Finding those double commas showed me
the problem and the emacs search-and-replace changed the two commas to a
single comma.

Now all's well. It took another mug of coffee and a lunch break to work my
way down to the beginning of the large file to the errors, but it worked
just as it did before FORTRAN IV had a debugger. :-)

Stay well, all!

You are claiming behavior that is not something R does, but is something Excel does constantly.

Compare what your data file looks like using a text editor with what R has imported. Absolutely do not use a spreadsheet program to do this.

Hi Val,
Try this:

dat=read.csv("myfile.csv",stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

However, the apparently silent conversion of format is a mystery to
me. The only time I have struck something like this was when exporting
dates from Excel some years ago, and there was a silent conversion to
mm/dd/yyyy format if the dates were in dd/mm/yyyy format. Could you
post some sample data?

Jim

Hi

Not sure why the date format was changed but if I am correct R do not read dates as dates but as character vector. You need to transfer such columns to dates by asDate. The error is probably from your use two asDate commands.

	  My speculation is that Microsoft Excel recognized that as a date and 
saved it in the "mm/dd/YYYY" format you saw when reading it into R with 
dat=read.csv("myfile.csv").


	  "str" told you the format.  You can convert that from character to 
Date using as.Date(dat$mydate, '%m/%d/%Y'), as documented in 
help('as.Date').


NOTE: The error message, "character string is not in a standard 
unambiguous format" is almost appropriate:  In this case, it's clear 
that "09/16/2019" refers to month 09, day 16, and year 2019.  However, 
if it were "09/06/2019", we would not know if it were September 6 or 9 
June of 2019.  If it were  "09/06/08", we would have the added 
possibility with the year first, followed by month and day:  June 8, 
2009.  This ambiguity is resolved most forcefully by ISO 8601.


	  Hope this helps.
	  Spencer Graves

Then you are looking at a different file... check your filenames. You have imported the column as character, and R has not yet recognized that it is supposed to be a date, so it can only show what it found.

You will almost certainly find your error if you make a reproducible example.

Subject: [R] heatmap ploting
Message-ID: <CAF4LHoh_jUGkX4=Xc_uuCRBYvKVC7n5O2oZDQwdCxRjs_yGaUg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Community,

I have an example heatmap plot in this link
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ePaR0gC2IKXm2gkeGylZ4vM_MEsWyW0/view?usp=sharing>
which was generated by java I believe, I want to make a similar plot in R.
Any clues on how to do it? Thanks.

The column is a gene, and the rows are different cancer types with
different numbers of patients. The heatmap value represents the expression
value, such as FPKM, which can range from 0 to over several hundreds.


Much thanks!

Steve

Thanks for providing the code, but it's much easier to help you if you
provide the data, too. Use dput(head(...)) to make it easy for us to
copy-paste the data.

sex[j] extracts the `j`th column out of the `sex` data frame. Does
`sex` contain 68 columns? If you want the `j`th row, use sex[j,].

Also, it may help to use merge() and have the R language do some of the
work for you, if you organise your `names` and `sex` into a single
data.frame to merge V(FriendGraph) with.

Additionally, you might save some of the execution time if you move the
V(FriendGraph) calculation out of the loop.

Hi Steve,
That plot looks to me as though a value-to-color transformation is
performed on the logarithm of gene expression. The scale bar can be
roughly reproduced like this:

library(plotrix)
plot(0,xlim=c(0,3))
gradient.rect(0,-0.1,3,0.1,
 col=color.scale(seq(0,3,0.1),
 c(0.7,1,1,1,0.7,0.2),
 c(0.7,1,0,0,0,0),
 c(1,0,0,0.1,0.7,0.2)))
text(0:3,rep(0.2,3),c(0,10,100,1000))

The horizontal lengths of the stacked bars of the plot can then be
adjusted to the number of subjects in a given bin of log gene
expressions. A tricky plot, but it can be done in R.

Jim

Message-ID: <CAMk+s2Q+udXcNYKWpx5g2STd3A=YRoa90_7nu_4gXX6Phb+pvQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I am connecting R to a libreoffice-generated database (.odb) using the
ODB package.
I would like to link a dataframe to a specific table, but I cannot
manage to extract a given table:
```
> db =  odb.open(".../LOdatabase.odb", jarFile = NULL)
> odb.tables(db)
$demographic
field.name field.type data.type     name                  comment
1          ID    INTEGER   numeric       ID Unique identifier (auto)
2    Study_ID    INTEGER   numeric Study_ID            link to STUDY
[...]
> sqlQuery = "FROM TABLE demographic SELECT ALL"
> odb.read(db, sqlQuery, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, check.names = FALSE,
+ encode = TRUE, autoLogical = TRUE)
Error: Error while executing SQL query  : "Unable to retrieve JDBC result set

Error: Error while executing SQL query  : "Unable to retrieve JDBC result set

```
What is the correct syntax?
Thank you

Thank you All.
The issue was not reading different file. I just mistyped the column
name, instead of typing My_date I typed mydate in the email.  The
problem is solved by using this
    dat=read.csv("myfile.csv",stringsAsFactors=FALS)
suggested by Jim.

Hi,

Not sure where you have been looking, but on CRAN:

https://cran.r-project.org/index.html

there is a box at the top of the main page to Download R for macOS, 
which brings you to:

https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/

The first version there, 4.1.2, which is the pkg binary for macOS 10.13 
and higher for Intel CPUs is the one that you want.

Note that there is also a macOS specific FAQ here:

https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html

and finally, a macOS specific help list here:

https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-mac

You will also likely want to install XQuartz, which is available here:

https://www.xquartz.org

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Dear all,

I saved my work in a Rimage that contains multiple objects ;

the objects were generated with Monocle3 :

one object is called CDS.

How shall I extract this object CDS (that has a complex structure) from the
R image ?

Occasionally, additional packages in R are installed in my home folder :

You can't. You can only save and load whole .RData files. You can, of
course, save and load separate R objects in separate files. But note
in ?save.image:

"For saving single R objects, saveRDS() is mostly preferable to
save(), notably because of the functional nature of readRDS(), as
opposed to load(). "

You may wish to search on "data serialization" (e.g. on Wikipedia) or
similar to better understand the underlying ideas.

IMO you are being a bit too literal. It is absolutely possible to load the file into a dedicated environment and use the $ or [[]] extraction operator to access a specific object in that environment.

?load
?new.env

Or, you can attach the file, copy to a new variable, and detach. (see examples in ?load)

I would have imagined that one could simply extract the quantiles of the 
HodgesLehmann at the appropriate tail probabilities:


quantile(boot.out$t, c(0.025, 0.975))
 ??? 2.5%??? 97.5%
400.5000 488.0001


It doesn't seem reasonable to have bootstrap CI's that are much tighter 
than the estimates on the original data:

449.75 444.25 453.25??? # seems to be cheating

This cheating comes from wilcox.test, which is called by HodgesLehman to 
do the calculations. Below is a function calling wilcox.test directly, 
and the bootstrapped intervals are always equal, no matter what way they 
are computed.



A <- c(488, 437, 500, 449, 364)
dat <- data.frame(A)

med <- function(d,i) {
   temp <- d[i, ]
   HodgesLehmann(temp)
}
med2 <- function(d, i, conf.level = 0.95){
   temp <- d[i, ]
   wilcox.test(temp,
               conf.int = TRUE,
               conf.level = Coalesce(conf.level, 0.8),
               exact = FALSE)$estimate
}

set.seed(2021)
boot.out <- boot(data = dat, statistic = med, R = 100)
set.seed(2021)
boot.out2 <- boot(data = dat, statistic = med2, R = 100, conf.level = 0.95)

HodgesLehmann(boot.out$t)
#[1] 452.75
HodgesLehmann(boot.out2$t)
#[1] 452.75

HodgesLehmann(boot.out$t, conf.level = 0.95)
#     est   lwr.ci   upr.ci
#452.7500 447.2500 458.7499
HodgesLehmann(boot.out2$t, conf.level = 0.95)
#     est   lwr.ci   upr.ci
#452.7500 447.2500 458.7499

quantile(boot.out$t, c(0.025, 0.975))
# 2.5% 97.5%
#400.5 494.0
quantile(boot.out2$t, c(0.025, 0.975))
# 2.5% 97.5%
#400.5 494.0

boot.ci(boot.out, type = "all")    # CI's are
boot.ci(boot.out2, type = "all")   # the same



But the bootstrap statistic vectors t are different:



identical(boot.out$t, boot.out2$t)
#[1] FALSE
all.equal(boot.out$t, boot.out2$t)
#[1] "Mean relative difference: 8.93281e-08"




I haven't time to check what is going on in wilcox.test, its source is a 
bit involved, with many if/else statements, maybe I'll come back to this 
but no promises made.


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Exactly: In the eyes of most R experts, it is the only useful use of attach():

   attach(".RData") 
   ls.str(2) # -> get alevel-1 str(.) of the objects in your image

Subject: [R] Environmental oddity.
Message-ID: <20211107133508.5c134a28@rolf-Latitude-E7470>


I have two functions which appear to differ only in their environments.
They look like:

> d1
> function (x, mean = 0, sd = 1, log = FALSE) 
> (((x - mean)/sd)^2 - 1) * if (log) 1 else dnorm(x, mean, sd)/sd
> <environment: namespace:stats>

and

> d2
> function (x, mean = 0, sd = 1, log = FALSE) 
> (((x - mean)/sd)^2 - 1) * if (log) 1 else dnorm(x, mean, sd)/sd

Typing "environment(d1)" gives

> <environment: namespace:stats>

and typing "environment(d2)" gives

> <environment: R_GlobalEnv>

The d2() function however gives an incorrect result:

> d1(1,0,3,TRUE)
> [1] -0.2962963
> d2(1,0,3,TRUE)
> [1] -0.8888889

In d2() the result of the if() statement does not get divided
by the final "sd" whereas in d1() it does (which is the desired/correct
result).

Of course the code is ridiculously kludgy (it was produced by "symbolic
differentiation").  That's not the point.  I'm just curious (idly?) as
to *why* the association of the namespace:stats environment with d1()
causes it to "do the right thing".

Can anyone give me any insight?  Ta.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

In general, the search for symbols for a function Z in a package Y will span only those namespaces that the package Y specifies. The search for symbols in a function whose parent environment is the global environment will start there, thereby opening the door to find masking versions of functions instead of the intended package function.

Kind of hard to investigate your case from here.

It can't be as simple as that. I get the same result (as your d2) with
the following:

d <- function (x, mean = 0, sd = 1, log = FALSE) {
    (((x - mean)/sd)^2 - 1) * if (log) 1 else dnorm(x, mean, sd) / sd
}
d(1, 0, 3, TRUE)
environment(d)
environment(d) <- as.environment("package:stats")
d(1, 0, 3, TRUE)

This sounds like a difference in precedence. The expression

if (log) 1 else dnorm(x, mean, sd) / sd

is apparently being interpreted differently as

d1: (if (log) 1 else dnorm(x, mean, sd)) / sd
d2: if (log) 1 else (dnorm(x, mean, sd)) / sd)

It's unclear how environments could affect this, so it would be very
helpful to have a reproducible example.

Best,

Subject: [R] Dispatching on 2 arguments?
Message-ID: <fc751ccc-3793-b236-db9f-dc907f986bee@syonic.eu>

Dear List-members,


I would like to experiment with dispatching on 2 arguments and have a 
few questions.


p1 = data.frame(x=1:3, coeff=1)
class(p1) = c("pm", class(p1));

I want to replace variables in a polynomial with either:
another polynomial, or another variable (character) or with a specific 
value.


1.) Can I dispatch on 2 arguments?


replace.pm.? = function(p1, p2, ...) {...}
or classic:
replace.pm = function(p1, p2, ...) {
 ??? if(is.numeric(p2) || is.complex(p2)) return(replace.pm.numeric(p1, 
p2, ...));
 ?? ?if(is.character(p2)) return(replace.pm.character(p1, p2=p2, ...));
 ?? else ...

}


I will provide some realistic examples below.


2.) Advantages / Disadvantages of each method
What are the advantages or disadvantages to each of these methods?
I do not yet understand what should be the best design.


Real example:


### Quintic
p1 = toPoly.pm("x^5 - 5*K*x^3 - 5*(K^2 + K)*x^2 - 5*K^3*x - K^4 - 6*K^3 
+ 5*K^2 - K")
# fractional powers: [works as well]
r = toPoly.pm("K^(4/5) + K^(3/5) + K^(1/5)")
# - we just found a root of a non-trivial quintic!
#?? all variables/monomials got cancelled;
replace.pm(p1, r, "x", pow=1)

# more formal
r = toPoly.pm("k^4*m^4 + k^3*m^3 + k*m")
# m^5 = 1; # m = any of the 5 roots of unity of order 5;
pR = p1;
pR = replace.pm(pR, r, xn="x") # poly
pR = replace.pm(pR, "K", xn="k", pow=5) # character
pR = replace.pm(pR, 1, xn="m", pow=5) # value
pR # the roots worked! [no remaining rows]
# - we just found ALL 5 roots!


The code is on Github (see below).


Sincerely,


Leonard

If you want to use the 'methods' package, you could do something like:


replace <- function (p1, p2, ...)
{
    stop(gettextf("cannot 'replace' with arguments of class %s and %s",
        sQuote(class(p1)[1L]), sQuote(class(p2)[1L])))
}


methods::setGeneric("replace")


methods::setMethod("replace", signature = c(p1 = "pm", p2 = "numeric"),
definition = replace.pm.numeric)
methods::setMethod("replace", signature = c(p1 = "pm", p2 = "character"),
definition = replace.pm.character)


First, we make the default function. I'm not sure what you want that to
look like, but I've made an example above.
Second, you make it generic so that you can provide methods for it.
Last, you add the methods you want. You specify the name of the generic
function, "replace", the classes of arguments it will accept, and then its
function definition.
You can use ?methods::setGeneric and ?methods::setMethod for help with
either of these functions. I hope this helps!

This seems to be caused by the deparser producing the same source text
for different expressions:

( x <- expression(`/`(`*`(a, if (b) c else d), e)) )
# expression(a * if (b) c else d/e)
( y <- expression(a * if (b) c else d/e) )
# expression(a * if (b) c else d/e)
all.equal(x, y)
# [1] TRUE

The expressions *seem* to be the same, but:

as.list(x[[1]])
# [[1]]
# `/`
# 
# [[2]]
# a * if (b) c else d
# 
# [[3]]
# e

as.list(y[[1]])
# [[1]]
# `*`
# 
# [[2]]
# a
# 
# [[3]]
# if (b) c else d/e

Perhaps it could be possible to make the deparser output extra
parentheses at the cost of slightly uglier output in cases when they
are not needed. all.equal.language uses deparse(), so it will behave
correctly when the deparse() output is fixed.

In the original example, as.list(body(d1)) and as.list(body(d2)) should
show different results, too.

Fascinating:

R> pryr::call_tree(body(d1))
R> pryr::call_tree(body(d2))

clearly show that the two functions have a different idea to what
expression the final "/sd" is applied too (as an earlier poster
suggested), but I have no idea why.

Deriv() seems to return the correct function, but when it is displayed,
the deparser(?) somehow omits a crucial pair of braces.

Cheers,

Rolf said these were automatically produced functions.  Those don't 
always deparse properly, because manipulating expressions can produce 
things that can never be produced by the parser.  I'm not sure this 
happened in this case.  You'd need to examine the parse trees of d1 and 
d2 to see.

There's also a possibility that the srcref attached to them is lying, 
and we're not seeing the deparsed versions of the functions.  Printing 
removeSource(d1) and removeSource(d2) should reveal that.

Here's how to construct a similar deparsing error:

# e1 and e2 are obviously different expressions
e1 <- quote(5 * if (TRUE) 2 else 3/4)
e2 <- quote(5 * (if (TRUE) 2 else 3)/4)
# and they evaluate differently
eval(e1)

eval(e2)

# We can make an equivalent version of e2 by messing around in it
e3 <- e2
as.list(e3[[c(2,3)]])

Thanks Duncan.  It's good to know that the anomaly wasn't just a result
of my doing something stupid.

Subject: [R] Warning msg after reinstall?
Message-ID: <b116d191-52b3-6a21-dd11-46ce9f172462@ncf.ca>

Evening gents:

First to quickly try and set the scene.

I run R on Linux Mint 19.3. I had version 3.5 installed, but wanted to
try and upgrade to 4.1. So... I deleted all R stuff I could find, setup
the software sources file, and tried to install. Didn't work. I suppose
it needs a more recent edition of Mint. Backpedalled as best I could.
Now 3.5 was uncooperative. Finally found some notes describing how to
install 3.6. That worked. So now I again have a functioning copy of R,
with a current edition of Rstudio as my principle access tool. Adding
pkgs through the software manager doesn't seem to be work, but as long
as I fire it up using the sudo command I can add them through Rstudio.

The puzzle comes at the end of an install round. It seems I may have
taken out something I shouldn't have as I get the following warning.

Warning messages:
1: In readLines(file, skipNul = TRUE) :
  cannot open compressed file
'/usr/lib/R/site-library/labelled/DESCRIPTION', probable reason 'No such
file or directory'
2: In readLines(file, skipNul = TRUE) :
  cannot open compressed file
'/usr/lib/R/site-library/TH.data/DESCRIPTION', probable reason 'No such
file or directory'

I'm not really sure. I assume I got sloppy withe deletions. I ask for
assistance to solve this. What does it mean? What can I do to correct
the error? Thanks in advance.

ttyl...

The topic here is R language, not operating system surgery. You probably shouldn't hold your breath for a solution to this here.

That said, compiling and running without installing for access by the whole system is always an option if you can fix the support libraries.

Point taken Jeff, IF it were a Linux msg. But it's not, having appeared
within an active R session following the install of some pkgs, so I
thought here was a logical place to start. The directory is present but
apparently the file is not. No doubt I approached things in a
disorganized way and deleted it when I should have left it alone. So
perhaps you or one of the other group members could suggest how to
replace what R is seeking or, if not here, what R group I might approach
to find an answer for this R problem,

If my advice below doesn't help, let's continue this in the other
mailing list, r-sig-debian at r-project.org
<https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-debian>.

It seems that you've been installing packages into the system-wide
library. Could you try removing all R-related deb packages from your
system, wiping the directories /usr/lib/R and /usr/share/R, then
installing R again? Alternatively, write a script to search files and
directories in /usr/lib/R and /usr/share/R, use `dpkg -S` to see if
it's owned by a package and move it away if not. Both options are quite
a bit dangerous, though.

On second thought, what is in /usr/lib/R/site-library/labelled
and /usr/lib/R/site-library/TH.data? If the two directories are empty,
you can just remove them.

I would have imagined that one could simply extract the quantiles of the 
HodgesLehmann at the appropriate tail probabilities:


quantile(boot.out$t, c(0.025, 0.975))
??? 2.5%??? 97.5%
400.5000 488.0001


It doesn't seem reasonable to have bootstrap CI's that are much tighter 
than the estimates on the original data:


> HodgesLehmann(boot.out$t, conf.level=0.95)
?? est lwr.ci upr.ci
449.75 444.25 453.25??? # seems to be cheating
> HodgesLehmann(dat$A, conf.level=0.95)
?? est lwr.ci upr.ci
?? 449??? 364??? 500??? # Much closer to the quantiles above

This cheating comes from wilcox.test, which is called by HodgesLehman to 
do the calculations. Below is a function calling wilcox.test directly, 
and the bootstrapped intervals are always equal, no matter what way they 
are computed.



A <- c(488, 437, 500, 449, 364)
dat <- data.frame(A)

med <- function(d,i) {
? temp <- d[i, ]
? HodgesLehmann(temp)
}
med2 <- function(d, i, conf.level = 0.95){
? temp <- d[i, ]
? wilcox.test(temp,
? ? ? ? ? ? ? conf.int = TRUE,
? ? ? ? ? ? ? conf.level = Coalesce(conf.level, 0.8),
? ? ? ? ? ? ? exact = FALSE)$estimate
}

set.seed(2021)
boot.out <- boot(data = dat, statistic = med, R = 100)
set.seed(2021)
boot.out2 <- boot(data = dat, statistic = med2, R = 100, conf.level = 0.95)

HodgesLehmann(boot.out$t)
#[1] 452.75
HodgesLehmann(boot.out2$t)
#[1] 452.75

HodgesLehmann(boot.out$t, conf.level = 0.95)
#? ? est? lwr.ci? upr.ci
#452.7500 447.2500 458.7499
HodgesLehmann(boot.out2$t, conf.level = 0.95)
#? ? est? lwr.ci? upr.ci
#452.7500 447.2500 458.7499

quantile(boot.out$t, c(0.025, 0.975))
# 2.5% 97.5%
#400.5 494.0
quantile(boot.out2$t, c(0.025, 0.975))
# 2.5% 97.5%
#400.5 494.0

boot.ci(boot.out, type = "all")? ? # CI's are
boot.ci(boot.out2, type = "all")? # the same



But the bootstrap statistic vectors t are different:



identical(boot.out$t, boot.out2$t)
#[1] FALSE
all.equal(boot.out$t, boot.out2$t)
#[1] "Mean relative difference: 8.93281e-08"




I haven't time to check what is going on in wilcox.test, its source is a 
bit involved, with many if/else statements, maybe I'll come back to this 
but no promises made.


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Anyone know if there are Plotly issues ones need to be aware of. For example
I quite often receive the following error "Error in dirname(to) : path too
long." I find there is no one fix. Is there some sort of Windows /Plotly
naming restrictions???

 

# create a line chart displaying launches by agency type, with highlighting

shared_launches %>%

  plot_ly(x = ~launch_year, y = ~n, color = ~agency_type) %>%

  add_lines() %>%

  highlight()

As Plotly for R is a product of private company, your query is off
topic here (though you may get a response if you are lucky). They have
their own Help forum to which you should post instead:

I don't know any details of Plotly, but Windows does have a directory depth limit that can be very frustrating. I think there is a registry setting that can help alleviate, but it breaks some things so it is highly dependent on how you use your computer as to whether you can take advantage of that setting.

References: <61898124.7060902.ref@sbcglobal.net>
Message-ID: <61898124.7060902@sbcglobal.net>

I have uptodate Debian Buster on my Linux platform and have been 
compiling R distros for quite some time, usually with success.

This time I have encountered the same error in my attempts to compile 
v-4..1.2 and then, when that failed, I had the same error with v-4.1.0.

The error in both cases was:

/home/comp/Downloads/R Packages/R-4.1.0/R-4.1.0/etc/Makeconf:10: 
Packages/R-4.1.0/R-4.1.0/share/make/vars.mk: No such file or directory.

I don't have the faintest idea as to what is going on, and, even worse, 
I don't know how to fix it.

Help will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

This is the case of Make breaking things by splitting the file path by
whitespace. Line 9 of Makeconf even contains a comment regarding this:

>> ## This fails if it contains spaces, or if it is quoted

Rename "R Packages" to R_Packages (or anything else without spaces in
it) to work around the error.

I think you'll need to describe what you did that led to this error.

There is a dedicated mailing list for Mac specific questions. You should 
subscribe before posting further but your first posting will still get 
moderated so don't send second postings because you think it's taking 
too long:

r-sig-mac at r-project.org

And I'm a Mac user but do not understand what code was used. And I don't 
think the complete error message was included on the subject line. You 
should paste the complete code that was used and indicate whether it 
occurs with every file or only one particular file or file name. And do 
include the complete error message in the body of the email.

(I'm wondering if there could be an issue with encoding of a file name 
since you are using a US locale but the MacOS may be set for a Mexican 
locale.)

yes, follow David Winsemius' advice.

In this example, it looks not to be a mac issue, but a new R user issue.
The partial message in the subject says

read.csv(12agosto.csv

The correct syntax is to quote the name of a file, so it should be

read.csv("12agosto.csv")

Hopefully Ivan's suggestion solves your problem. One thing I'd suggest: 
building in a different dir than the source.  All you need is to put the 
source in some dir (e.g. "src"), switch to an empty dir, and run 
src/configure from there, followed by make.  This makes for a cleaner 
separation of source and products.

It looks as though you ran

  read.csv(12agosto.csv)

You need to put the filename in quotes:

  read.csv("12agosto.csv")

Hello,

We can't really answer your question, we don't have access to the file.
But here are some questions/tips.

1. R is case sensitive, is it TRUCKING.RDtata or TRUCKING.Rdtata?
2. In a clean R session, is there any warning or error message after 
running load("TRUCKING.Rdata")?
3. If not, what is the output of ls()? This will give you the objects in 
the global environment and RData files may store many objects. Exactly 
what was loaded?
4. I don't understand what do you mean by "trucking 4". Is it the name 
of a data set you expect to be in that file? If the file with "4 
carriers" was loaded, try running str(tablename) to see its structure. 
(tablename is to be replaced by the table's actual name).


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

That was certainly a red-faced forehead slapper!!

I should have known better. I changed the name of ~/Downloads/R Packages 
to ~/Downloads/R_Packages and the problem went away.

Many thanks to you all for your patience and solutions.

Hi,

I use that mailing list because I?ve tried to send a message to the
r-core address and received :

 I would like to borrow most of the code of stats :: window within my
package disaggR, which has an uncompatible license as it is MIT not
GPL2. window has some extra overhead because of the calling of time()
at the beginning of the function (that is only used for extend =
FALSE). Copying the function and modifying it would allow me a bit of
optimization, but I need some agreement as my package is MIT.
Is it possible ?

Thanks,

Arnaud FELDMANN

Questions about package development should be posted to
R-package-devel (**not R-devel**).
See https://www.r-project.org/mail.html  for details.

(I am not sure that they get into legal weeds there, but it seems like
the right place to try).

This question isn't a "how to do package development" question... this is about a specific package so you should send email to the package developer identified by the maintainer() function.

I can't foresee this request finding a positive response from R Core, but email seems the most correct approach.

I would assume not.  Most of R has many, many authors, and some of us 
will not agree to changing the license to a more permissive form.

I think Arnaud is the package developer; his question is whether he can 
copy R source into his package.

I understand that, but the reason he gives for copying code from the stats package is to change the license. That decision seems like something that requires a very direct communication with/permission from the maintainer.

The stats package doesn't give a valid maintainer() address.  It gives a 
vague reference to the r-project.org website, but that website doesn't 
give a contact address.

In fact, the authorship of R is very widely distributed among at least 
dozens of contributors.  Identifying and contacting them all would be a 
nightmare but probably isn't necessary.  However, identifying and 
contacting the necessary ones (the ones who hold copyright on the parts 
he wants to copy) would be very difficult.  Not contacting the relevant 
ones would mean Arnaud's work would be potentially in violation of their 
copyright.

Even if he did manage to contact all the copyright holders, some of them 
would probably not agree to more permissive licenses.  For example, I am 
a copyright holder on some parts of the source, and I wouldn't agree to 
relicensing.

Thanks for your answer. That is helpful even if that is disappointing
for me ;) I can see now that, as R (base and recommended packages) has
had contributions from a lot of people, it's not like a package, you
just can't have a punctual "okay do what you want". I'll have to stick
with a slow window call, I guess.

I was right to ask anyway, and thanks for your advices.

Rather you should think long and hard if and why you  really
really want to stick with a non-GPL licence for you package.
That is the real problem and a shame in my eyes!

R would almost surely never have grown big if the original authors,
Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman  hadn't decided to adopt the GNU Public 
Licence (GPL)  very early ... and Ross & Robert said it was to a
large extent because I had insisted that this was important and
would potentially bring quite a few highly qualified people (all
from academia at the time) to adopt and contribute to R.

So, *not* using  GPL  for your package feels slightly as a slap
in the face of all the people who made R what it is today.

and just for those it is not obvious:
You *could* easily copy part of R code into your package if
you switched to use GPL -- of course still attributing these
parts a copyrighted by the R Core team.
Quite a few package maintainers have done so, e.g.,
testthat, actuar, pryr, vetr, DPQ, round, ... {I count about 80
CRAN packages}

Message-ID: <CAMk+s2TGYd5Hs2O6-5eKy9n0xMy1FwbR4rXZPxGte+ZH8eDsYw@mail.gmail.com>

how can I connect to a LibreOffice base odb file using the package odbc for R?
I tried with:

+                  pwd = "",
+                  host = "localhost",
+                  port = 5432)
Error: nanodbc/nanodbc.cpp:1021: 00000: [unixODBC][Driver

```

What would be the correct driver/syntax?

Dear Luigi,

I found the package ODB

	https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ODB/ODB.pdf

and was able to install it after 
reconfiguring rJava ...  

The help page ?ODB::odb.open has this 
example:

	odbFile <- tempfile(fileext=".odb")
	odb.create(odbFile, overwrite="do")
	odb <- odb.open(odbFile)
	
	# New table
	odb.write(odb, "CREATE TABLE fruits (name VARCHAR(6) PRIMARY KEY)")
	odb.insert(odb, "fruits", c("banana", "pear", "peach"))
	
	# Writes to the file and closes the connection
	odb.close(odb, write=TRUE)

Best,
Rasmus

Thank you.
I have used ODB, it looks easier to use (and install since it needs
way fewer dependencies than odbc) but I can't run the SQL statement:
```
> library(ODB)
Loading required package: DBI
Loading required package: RJDBC
Loading required package: rJava
> db =  odb.open("proof.odb", jarFile = NULL)
> odb.tables(db)
$day
field.name field.type data.type   name comment
1     day_ID    INTEGER   numeric day_ID      NA
2        Day    INTEGER   numeric    Day      NA

$demographic
field.name field.type data.type       name                  comment
1          ID    INTEGER   numeric         ID Unique identifier (auto)
2    Study_ID    INTEGER   numeric   Study_ID            link to STUDY
[...]
> print(odb.read(db, "SELECT * FROM demographic"))
Error: Error while executing SQL query  : "Unable to retrieve JDBC result set
  JDBC ERROR: Table not found in statement [SELECT * FROM demographic]
  Statement: SELECT * FROM demographic"
```

the database contains a table `demographic` but I can't select it.
Would you know what is the correct syntax?

Are you willing to send me a part of the 
the proof.odb so I can run the query?  R

.... also Note in ?ODB::odb.read says:

	To query databases built with OpenOffice 
	or LibreOffice, it may be necessary to 
	quote table and/or column names in 
	?sqlQuery?, as the default behavior of 
	the HSQL engine is to convert unquoted 
	table and column names to uppercases.

Sure! I am attaching a simplified version of it. I did not see the
quote text; it might be difficult to call all table's names since
there are hundreds of columns..

Dear Luigi,

I tried quoting ...  This:

	odb = ODB::odb.open("proof.odb", jarFile = NULL)
	
	dput(sapply(names(ODB::odb.tables(odb)), function(tbl) {
	sqlQuery <- paste0('SELECT * FROM "', tbl, '"')
	ODB::odb.read(odb, sqlQuery)
	}, simplify=F))
	
	ODB::odb.close(odb, write=FALSE)

Yields this:

	list(day = structure(list(day_ID = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
	8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17), Day = c(1, 2, 3, 5, 7,
	9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 31)), row.names = c(NA,
	18L), class = "data.frame"), demographic = structure(list(ID = logical(0),
	    Study_ID = logical(0), Hosp_ID = logical(0), Hospital = logical(0),
	    Address = logical(0), Occ_ID = logical(0), Age = logical(0),
	    Sex = logical(0)), row.names = c(NA, 0L), class = "data.frame"),
	    hospitals = structure(list(Hosp_ID = c(0, 1, 2, 3), Hospital = c("Fatebenefratelli",
	    "Royal Free", "Santa Croce in Gerusalemme", "Sagrada Familia"
	    ), Address = c("Via Tiberina", "Tottenham Court road", "Via Latina",
	    "Barcelona")), row.names = c(NA, 4L), class = "data.frame"))

The demographics table is empty, but has 
headers ....  Maybe you selected the 
wrong file ...

Best,
Rasmus

I tried this:
```
x = dput(sapply(names(ODB::odb.tables(db)), function(tbl) {
sqlQuery <- paste0('SELECT * FROM "', demographic, '"')
ODB::odb.read(db, sqlQuery)
}, simplify=F))
y = x$demographic

so now `y` is the dataframe for the table `demographic`:

I have the code to create ggplot2 boxplots using two attributes (e.g.,
chemical concentration and month) from the same tibble. Is there an example
from which I can learn how to make boxplots from different
tibbles/dataframes (e.g., chemical concentrations and monitoring location)?

TIA,

To clarify: I'd like to produce a plot such as Naomi Robbins presents in
figure 4.11 of her book, "Creating More Effective Graphics."

In my case I want to present river boxplots of discharges over each
monitoring site's period of record as a vertical stack of horizontal
boxplots. The northern-most site actually has negative discharges twice a
day as it's tidally influenced at about 125 River Miles from the ocean and
the incoming tides push the water upriver.

Dear Luigi,

Yes, from the named list of dataframes, 
you access the demographic table like 
that.  

You can remove dput() now, I used it 
only to print the output; read ?dput, 
it's very handy the next time you ask 
questions on this list.  

Take a closer look at my obfuscated code 
...  To only query the demographic 
table, you would use 

	ODB::odb.read(odb, 'SELECT * FROM "demographic"')

Best,
Rasmus

I don't understand your question.  It looks like the example in ?lattice::panel.bwplot does
exactly what you want (modulo using ggplot instead of lattice).  Therefore it looks like creating a single column of y
from the y in each data.frame, and also a single column of x from the x in each data.frame should be enough.

Here is an even simpler example

y <- rnorm(20)
x <- rep(1:2, each=10)
library(lattice)
bwplot(x ~ y, horizontal=TRUE)

Richard,

I've used lattice in the past and am learning ggplot2 now.

Thanks for your lattice suggestion.

Bert,

My web search was for multiple boxplots and I didn't see what I wanted. I'll
continue reading the ggplot2 third edition and figure it out.

Rich,

I think many here may not quite have enough info to help you.

But the subject of multiple plots has come up. There are a slew of ways,
especially in the ggplot paradigm, to make multiple smaller plots into a
larger display showing them in some number of rows and columns, or other
ways. Some methods use facet_wrap() or facet_grid() type functionality that
let you plot multiple subdivisions of the data independently. These though
generally have to be in some way related.

Yet others let you make many independent graphs and save them and later
recombine them in packages like cowplot. 

So, although it may also be possible to do whatever it is you want within a
single plot, it may also make sense to do it as loosely described above.

Avi,

Actually, you've reflected my thinking.

My experience with facets (which I belive are like latice's conditioned
trellis plots has each plot in a separate frame in a row, column, or
matrix.) That won't communicate what I want viewers to see as well as would
having all in a single frame.

My data represent hydrologic and geochemical conditions at four locations
along the mainstem of a river. While the period of record for each
monitoring gauge is different, I want to illustrate how highly variable
conditions are at each location. The major factor of interest is discharge,
the volume of water passing a river cross section at the gauge location in
cubic feet per second. I have created boxplots for each site representing
the distribution of discharge for the entire data set and I'd like to place
each of the four horizontal boxplots stacked vertically with the
southern-most at the bottom and the northern-most at the top (the river
flows north).

I discovered cowplot yesterday but haven't yet read the PDF or vignette.

While I certainly may be wrong, I believe that seeing all four boxplots in
the same frame makes the differences in distribution most clear.

Rich

I googled for "ggplot2 boxplots by group" and the first hit was
  https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/265-grouped-boxplot-with-ggplot2.html
which displays lots of variants along with the code to produce them.  It
has links to ungrouped boxplots and shows how violin plots can better
display your data.

Bill,

I searched for 'ggplot2 multiple boxplots' so I missed that one.

Bill,

As I thought, all the returned pages use multiple groups within the same
dataframe. I'm still looking to learn how to pass multiple dataframes to one
ggplot() function, each with its own aesthetics.

I think that I've found the solution (haven't yet tested it, though):
<https://statisticsglobe.com/combine-two-ggplot2-plots-from-different-data-frames-in-r>.

It's from Statistical Globe and uses this code:
ggp <- ggplot(NULL, aes(x, y)) +    # Draw ggplot2 plot based on two data frames
   geom_point(data = data1, col = "red") +
   geom_line(data = data2, col = "blue")
ggp                                 # Draw plot

More when I try it with four boxplots.

I strongly recommend that you change your way of thinking when it comes to ggplot: if your data are not yet in one data frame then your data are not yet ready for plotting.

It is possible to specify separate data frames for different layers of the plot, but this severely complicates building legends.

Jeff,

I understand your concern and I'm willing to take the time to make each plot
as effective as is possible with ggplot2.

My data sets are large; the total is 7,344,118 lines; the largest set
contains 834,493 lines.

Thanks very much,

Rich

Rich,

Boxplots like many other things in ggplot can be grouped in various ways. I
often do something like this:

Say I have a data.frame with columns called PLACE and MEASURE others. The
one I call PLACE would be a factor containing the locations you are
measuring at. I mean it would be character strings of your N places but the
factors would be made in the order you want the results in. The MEASURE
variable in each row would contain one of the many measures at that
location. You probably would have other columns like DATE.

To display multiple boxplots subdivided by place is as easy as using the
phrase in an aes() clause like:

	ggplot(your_data, aes(..., color=PLACE)) + geom_boxplot()

There are other variants or using group= but it works fine usually for up to
six places as colors often get recycled.

My impression is that you want to sort of force ggplot to keep forgetting
earlier data and commence anew on new data and other attributes. Yes, there
is a way to ask ggplot to not inherit things from step to step and take new
instructions BUT you may not be aware of how different the ggplot paradigm
is compared to other graphics engines.

Some of the other plot repeatedly as you go along and new layers sort of
overlay old layers. Ggplot makes no plots whatsoever. It creates a huge
complex object and populates it as it goes along. Some changes in setting
simply overwrite earlier ones that are then gone. The plotting can be done
at any later time (or automatically when it finishes) using one of the
methods known to print(). So some of what you want may not work well as it
normally does not want to store multiple data sets.

In one sense, I would say the ggplot way is to focus on getting your data
into the right shape. In your case, have you considered reading in your
multiple data items into df1 through df4 or whatever and making changes so
each has a new column called something like PLACE that is the same for all
items in df1 and another for df2 and so on?

When you have done that and made all the dfN have the same names and numbers
for columns, you can combine them into one df_combined using something like
rbind().

You can then change the column in df_combined called PLACE to be a factor of
itself in the order you want based on the compass.

What you have then can be given to ggplot as described above. Note in some
places ggplot sees a factor in the order it is sequenced, i.e. it may see it
as containing a 1  and 2 and so on. So the easiest way to make it do some
things is before you call it. Somewhat more advanced users can do odd things
in midstream like y=refactor(something) with ggplot.

My experience with facets (which I belive are like latice's conditioned
trellis plots has each plot in a separate frame in a row, column, or
matrix.) That won't communicate what I want viewers to see as well as would
having all in a single frame.

My data represent hydrologic and geochemical conditions at four locations
along the mainstem of a river. While the period of record for each
monitoring gauge is different, I want to illustrate how highly variable
conditions are at each location. The major factor of interest is discharge,
the volume of water passing a river cross section at the gauge location in
cubic feet per second. I have created boxplots for each site representing
the distribution of discharge for the entire data set and I'd like to place
each of the four horizontal boxplots stacked vertically with the
southern-most at the bottom and the northern-most at the top (the river
flows north).

I discovered cowplot yesterday but haven't yet read the PDF or vignette.

While I certainly may be wrong, I believe that seeing all four boxplots in
the same frame makes the differences in distribution most clear.

Thanks,

Rich

I've designed and used multiple boxplots in many projects. They might show
geochemical concentrations at two locations or in two (or three) separate
time periods. All data in a single dataframe.

What I need to plot are multiple 'your_data' sets. I'll be testing this:
ggp <- ggplot(NULL, aes(x, y)) +    # Draw ggplot2 plot based on two data frames
   geom_point(data = data1, col = "red") +
   geom_line(data = data2, col = "blue")
ggp                                 # Draw plot

today, but using four boxplots.

Rich,

I think we have suggested something several times that you ignore as you are
focused on your way of thinking.

If you read the last part of the letter I wrote in public, I suggest
combining your multiple dataframes into one if they are compatible and
including a new column called something like PLACE. The existence of that
variable lets you tell ggplot you want MULTIPLE plots placed in a grid based
on that variable OR in other words, asking ggplot to subdivide your data
into four parts and make one plot for each and then place them into a
matrix. 

I will not spell out the many variations you can make but some variations
have you add another layer to the ggplot that may use formula notation to
specify what combination of variables to do the subdivisions by or
specifying you want then in rows (meaning vertically stacked) based on a
variable and so on.

Look up facet_grid() and facet_wrap() as various ways to do this. Note you
may want to examine some options such as setting the scales to be the same
or free.

You can always create a graphics layout  and then plot different
ggplot objects in the separate regions of the layout. See ?grid.layout
(since ggplots are grobs)  and ?plot.ggplot  . This also **may** be
useful by showing examples using grid.arrange()

Still, I suspect that Jeff Newmiller may be right about needing to
structure your data more appropriately for what you wish to do.

Bert,

For this plot I could create a new data set with only site_nbr, year and cfs
columns; it would be 3,016,005 rows long.

Or, I could create separate boxplots and arrange them in a row. That might
be the easiest.

Thanks,

Rich

Avi/Jeff/Burt,

Here are the head and tail of one data file:
site_nbr,year,mon,day,hr,min,tz,cfs
14174000,1986,10,01,00,30,PDT,11900

14174000,2021,09,30,23,57,PDT,5050

(Water years begin October 1st and end September 30th.)

The other three locations have the same format.

The boxplots for each PLACE (site_nbr) should summarize all MEASURE (cfs)
values for all recorded data (DATE).

The R tibbles have a datetime column which could be the DATE.

If I assemble all 4 sites into a single tupple I suppose it would have three
columns PLACE (the grouping factor), DATE (on the x axis), and MEASURE (cfs on
the y axis) and each boxplot would be grouped so the
command would be:

disc_plot <- ggplot(df, aes(x = group, y = cfs)) +
 	geom_boxplot()

Is this close?

Thanks,

Rich

As I replied to Rich privately for another message, I suggest that you may
well be able to fit what you need in memory, if careful. But my main point
is that when you have so much data, you do not need all of it to make a
representative graph. A boxplot made using 100,000 data points may well have
too many outliers to display resulting in a bushy tail and not be all that
much more accurate than one made using 10,000 randomly chosen data points
from it.

So the idea would be to read in df1 into memory, trimming away any columns
not needed, then use something like sample() to make a smaller version and
rm() the original and repeat by reading in the second and third and so on.

Now add a PLACE column to each of df1 through dfN and then cbind() them
together and again throw away anything no longer needed.

Finally, you can use factors as already discussed including as a way to use
less data as a factor is just an integer vector attached to a sort of
dictionary containing one copy of the text aspect of your data. 

Then call ggplot and ...

The results may vary depending on the size chosen and it may be wise to use
set.seed() to some value so it does the same thing each time you run it.

Your thought of going to make separate boxplots also can use as much memory
or more if you keep everything in memory as you go along.

And, BTW, for people using truly big data, there are approaches that get
them huge amounts of memory either within their own machines, or using web
services.

Thanks, Bert. See my last post showing data set structure and suggested
collection for use by grouping.

This desktop has 32G RAM and 2T disc space.

I just posted a sample of one data set and my interpretation of your
suggestion for grouping.

I need all the data for this initial distribution summary because it affects
chemical concentrations in the receiving waters and the size of the
regulatory mixing zone.

Rich,

This is not a place designed for using packages but since this discussion
persists, I will supply you with SAMPLE code thrown together in just a few
minutes to illustrate the IDEAS, but your would obviously be tweaked to your
needs. I made a very small amount of data to illustrate several approaches
and neglected worrying about the X dimension. And, you may well want to use
other variants such as facet_grid() instead if it does more like what you
want.

I then threw in cowplot() as an example of doing it another way. This is
more useful for combining heterogeneous graphs. Many of the thinks I show
just as a silly example have alternates and there are multiple packages that
do similar (and also different) things than cowplot does if you want to tue
the output with other niceties.

 If you copy the code below (installing needed packages first if needed) it
should run on your machine if you do it in chunks so you can see the graphs
one at a time.

#START of code

# Load libraries needed, using install.packages() first if needed.
library(tidyverse)

# Make sample data AS IF you have already read in from file and converted.
df1 <- data.frame(site_nbr=1, DATE=1:5,
cfs=c(11900,11800,11900,11700,11800))
df2 <- data.frame(site_nbr=2, DATE=3:7,
cfs=c(12900,12600,12900,12700,12300))

# Combine al your data into one df.
df <- rbind(df1, df2)
# rm (df1, df2)

# Make a factor in the order you want.
df$site_nbr <- factor(x=df$site_nbr, levels=c(2,1))

# ready for a ggplot segmented by site_nbr.
ggplot(data=df, aes(x=NULL, y=cfs)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(group=site_nbr))

# Or use color instead for a more specific grouping.
ggplot(data=df, aes(x=NULL, y=cfs)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(color=site_nbr))

# Or make multiple lattice-like plots, default may be horizontal.
ggplot(data=df, aes(x=NULL, y=cfs)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~site_nbr)

# Or make multiple lattice-like plots, specifying you want vertical.
ggplot(data=df, aes(x=NULL, y=cfs)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~site_nbr, nrow=2)

# The above has the same scale used, so if you want, change them.
ggplot(data=df, aes(x=NULL, y=cfs)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~site_nbr, nrow=2, ncol=1, scales="free")

# ALTERNATE METHOD of making multiple plots and combining them later.
require("cowplot")

# read in data to simulate what is shown below:
df1 <- data.frame(site_nbr=1, DATE=1:5,
cfs=c(11900,11800,11900,11700,11800))
df2 <- data.frame(site_nbr=2, DATE=3:7,
cfs=c(12900,12600,12900,12700,12300))

# Create and save two ggplots, or more in your case:

p1 <- ggplot(data=df1, aes(x=NULL, y=cfs)) +
  geom_boxplot(color="red", fill="yellow")


p2 <- ggplot(data=df2, aes(x=NULL, y=cfs)) +
  geom_boxplot(color="green", fill="pink")

# combine the two or more verically using the plot_grid() from cowplot
plot_grid(p1, p2, ncol=1)

Avi/Jeff/Burt,

Here are the head and tail of one data file:
site_nbr,year,mon,day,hr,min,tz,cfs
14174000,1986,10,01,00,30,PDT,11900

14174000,2021,09,30,23,52,PDT,5050
14174000,2021,09,30,23,57,PDT,5050

(Water years begin October 1st and end September 30th.)

The other three locations have the same format.

The boxplots for each PLACE (site_nbr) should summarize all MEASURE (cfs)
values for all recorded data (DATE).

The R tibbles have a datetime column which could be the DATE.

If I assemble all 4 sites into a single tupple I suppose it would have three
columns PLACE (the grouping factor), DATE (on the x axis), and MEASURE (cfs
on the y axis) and each boxplot would be grouped so the command would be:

disc_plot <- ggplot(df, aes(x = group, y = cfs)) +
 	geom_boxplot()

Is this close?

Thanks,

Rich

Avi,

I'll find a cowplot help site.

The data were already read in. Now I need to learn more of cowplot's
plot_grid to put the site name on the x-axis, turn the boxplots horizontal,
and change the plot box so it's not as wide as the default.

Thanks very much,

Rich

You should probably glance at the R Graphics Cookbook.  That was my
gateway to ggplot.  I believe ggplot is a part of the tidyverse so
there should good information.

I use macOS BigSur v.11.5
R v.4.0.5 macOS
package ?ltable? does power analysis based on GSL-2.7
Xcode v.13.1

It goes smoothly with all OK on Checking, building, installing both with R and RStudio v. 1.3.1093
The only problem appears with Installing package in RStudio immediately after deleting it (no help.rd file found) which is solved just by rebooting RStudio

John,

I have Hadley's ggplot2 book and keep referring to it but haven't used it
before this project.

Thanks for your suggestion,

I believe the R-package-devel list is where you should post this, not

Subject: [R] ggplot2: 'not finding <-<- error'
Message-ID: <6a25aa4-8c2a-62e9-fec-6e39fdd5374f@appl-ecosys.com>

I'm writing a script to plot data distributions. It worked in a basic form
and I'm now adding features and tweaking the presentation. When I sourced
the file this error appeared:

Error in p1 <- ggplot(data = pdx_disc, aes(x = NULL, y = cfs)) + geom_boxplot(color = "#00008B",  (from all_disc_boxplot.r#9) :
   could not find function "<-<-"

Line 9 in the script defines the first boxplot:
p1 <- ggplot(data = pdx_disc, aes(x = NULL, y = cfs)) +
     geom_boxplot(
         # custom boxes
         color='#00008B',
         fill='#00008B',
         alpha=0.2,
         # custom outliers
         outlier.color='#B22222',
         outlier.fill='#FF3030',
         outlier.size=2) +
     coord_flip() +
     xlab = 'Portland Discharge'

I don't see any <-<- (nor have I before now) and I need help understanding
the source of this error.

TIA,

Rich

I think it's your xlab.  Should be:

### creating reproducible example
library(tidyverse)

rnorm(50) %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  rename(cfs = value) -> pdx_disc


ggplot(data = pdx_disc, aes(x = NULL, y = cfs)) +
  geom_boxplot(
    # custom boxes
    color='#00008B',
    fill='#00008B',
    alpha=0.2,
    # custom outliers
    outlier.color='#B22222',
    outlier.fill='#FF3030',
    outlier.size=2) +
  coord_flip() +
  ### I think this is what you want for your xlab:
  xlab('Portland Discharge')

Chris,

Ah, I should know better, but I didn't relate the error message to that
line.

Thank you.

I have an R color chart downloaded from the Web March 4, 2015. Using it to
set ggplot2 colors R responds with 'Error: Unknown colour name: FF3030' for
a number of these colors.

There are several different color charts for R when I look for a new one but
I cannot tell which one has all colors recognized by the latest R version.

Avi,

That's really helpful. Names are more easily grokked than are hex numbers.

Thanks,

Hi Rich,

You don't show the actual code that you used, and I do not use ggplot, 
but if you want to use RGB hex codes to define a color, you need to use 
'#' as a prefix for the 6 character RGB code:

For example:

 > plot(1:10, col = "FF3030")
Error in plot.xy(xy, type, ...) : invalid color name 'FF3030'

versus:

plot(1:10, col = "#FF3030")

the latter which includes the '#' and works to generate the plot.

Otherwise, as Avi apparently replied separately, use colors() or 
colours() to see the actual color text names and ?colors for more help.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Subject: [R] Using update() within a function with a changed formula
Message-ID: <d936f30061a04707923f05509a745b79@UM-MAIL3214.unimaas.nl>

Hello all,

Say I would like to change the outcome in a formula to a variable not part of the original dataset. This works just fine:

res <- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl, data=mtcars)
res
y <- rnorm(nobs(x))
update(x, formula = y ~ .)

But not when doing so within a function:

rm(y)

f <- function(x) {
   y <- rnorm(nobs(x))
   update(x, formula = y ~ .)
}

f(res)

Is there a way to make this work? Using y <<- ... inside the function works, but I would like to avoid such a heavy-handed approach.

Best,
Wolfgang

Formulas have associated environments, and that's where functions using 
them look for variables.  update() leaves the formula environment 
unchanged, as documented in ?update.formula. Since yours started out as 
globalenv(), you would need to put y there, and that's what you want to 
avoid.

However, the default update() method (the one you call on res, that 
calls the formula method) allows you to change other things.

So you could do it this way:

res <- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl, data=mtcars)

f <- function(x) {
   y <- rnorm(nobs(x))
   newdata <- cbind(model.frame(x), y)
   update(x, formula = y ~ ., data = newdata)
}
f(res)

Subject: [R] Confidence Interval for p1-p2 and plot the CI with bar chart
Message-ID: <CAE9stmfn_GL891p-dcw2y0s_GDDuvOoXmg=+GM0BoMT-XcP3rw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All:



I do have a binary data set with multiple variables, event = 1 in all
variables. As an example, I attached a data set with 6 variables. The first
column is the grouping variable. Then the next 5 columns are the binary
data for 5 variables.



- Can we compute the confidence interval for the difference between the two
proportions of the event = 1 in both groups (say: G1 ? G2) for the 5
variables in one shut.



- I also need to create the Bar plot of individual proportions (both groups
side-by-side) and add the confidence intervals bar for the 5 variables in
one graph.





Example.Data <- read.table(file="F/Example_Data_for_R.csv", header=T,
sep=",")

Example.Data

attach(Example.Data)







#### For example, this is how I use the prop.test() function to get the CI
for p1-p2



x12 <- c(x1, x2)

n12 <- c(n1, n2)

prop.test(x12, n12, conf.level = 0.95)$conf.int



But, I am not sure how to use it for raw data, and for multiple pairs of
data in one shut if possible.



With many thanks in advance

Abou

Hi Abou,
Perhaps this will be helpful. Be aware that you will cop some flak for
putting error bars on a bar plot.

aadat<-data.frame(group=c(rep("Exp",50),rep("Con",50)),
 v1=sample(0:1,100,TRUE),
 v2=sample(0:1,100,TRUE),
 v3=sample(0:1,100,TRUE),
 v4=sample(0:1,100,TRUE),
 v5=sample(0:1,100,TRUE))
ggps<-function(x,group) {
 gns<-as.vector(table(group))
 return(by(x,group,sum)/gns)
}
testggps<-data.frame(
 group=c("A","A","A","B","B","B","B","C","C","C","C","C"),
 x=c(1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0))
aaprop<-sapply(aadat[,2:6],ggps,aadat[,1])
library(plotrix)
barpos<-barp(aaprop,ylim=c(0,0.65),col=c(2,3),names.arg=colnames(aaprop))
legend(2.5,0.65,c("Con","Exp"),fill=c(2,3))
dispersion(barpos$x,barpos$y,ulim=aaprop/10)

Hi All,

A new package `steprf` is now available on CRAN.  It introduces several
novel predictive variable selection methods for random forest (RF). They
are based on various variable  importance methods and predictive accuracy
in stepwise algorithms. Their performance can be seen in the references
cited in the description of the package.

Cheers,

'x' and 'n' must have the same length
```
Since `x` is "a vector of counts of successes, a one-dimensional table
with two entries, or a two-dimensional table (or matrix) with 2
columns, giving the counts of successes and failures, respectively." I
provided point$Class. The total number of tests is
length(point$Class).
There are three levels:
```
> unique(df$Class)
[1] negative  positive  uncertain
Levels: negative positive uncertain
```
I tried to remove the levels to check if the levels were interfering
with the test:
```
> df$Class = levels(droplevels(df$Class))
Error in `$<-.data.frame`(`*tmp*`, Class, value = c("negative", "positive",  :
replacement has 3 rows, data has 5000000
```
What would be the syntax for this test? The idea is to get the most
common value for each unique(df$Set) and prop.test will provide also
the 95% CI for the estimate.
Thanks

Contour needs the Z data in a grid, with the X and Y data corresponding 
to rows and columns.  The interp::interp() function in the interp 
package should be able to convert your data to this format; see its help 
page.  An alternative is the akima::interp() function, which may have 
licensing issues.

contour() works on matrices (sometimes called "wide format" data). Z
must be a numeric matrix, X must be a numeric vector with length(X) ==
nrow(Z), and Y must be a numeric vector with length(Y) == ncol(Z). This
is described in ?contour.

Since you have a three-column data.frame ("long format" data), you can
use lattice::contourplot instead (e.g. contourplot(Z ~ X + Y, data =
df)) or the appropriate combination of ggplot2 functions.

Alternatively, if your data is already on a grid, you can make a matrix
out of your three-column data.frame, but the procedure is a bit awkward:

ret <- reshape(
 df, direction = "wide", v.names = 'Z', idvar = 'X', timevar = 'Y'
)
contour(
 X <- ret[, 1],
 Y <- attr(ret, "reshapeWide")$times,
 Z <- as.matrix(ret[,-1])
)

(Can be also done with xtabs(); reshape2 and many other contributed
packages also offer some ways of doing that.)

Where did you get panel.smoother()? There is no such panel function in
lattice.

Is something like this what you want?

x <- 1:100
y <- rnorm(100, mean =5)
end <- 91 # tentative smooth after this
xyplot(y ~x, cutoff = end, col1 = "black", col2 = "red"
       , panel = function(x, y,  col1, col2, cutoff) {
          sqleft <- seq_len(cutoff)
          sqright <- seq.int(cutoff +1, length(x))
          col <- rep(c(col1,col2), times = c(cutoff, length(x) - cutoff))
          panel.points(x, y, col = col)
          ylo <- predict(loess(y ~ x))
          panel.lines(x[sqleft], ylo[sqleft], col = col1, lwd =2)
          panel.lines(x[sqright], ylo[sqright], col = col2, lwd = 2, lty =
"dotted")
       })

Notes:
1. This works because of loess default to predict at given x's. Modify as
required if you change to another smoother or wish to use different points
at which to plot the smoother.
2. This can almost certainly be done by creating a grouping variable to
separate the two plotting regimes and might be slicker and more robust with
that approach.

Subject: [R] How to create a proper S4 class?
Message-ID: <66a496db-7d5d-6ffa-ee2b-eea3eb9ea033@syonic.eu>

Dear List-Members,


I want to create an S4 class with 2 data slots, as well as a plot and a 
line method.


Unfortunately I lack any experience with S4 classes. I have put together 
some working code - but I presume that it is not the best way to do it. 
The actual code is also available on Github (see below).


1.) S4 class
- should contain 2 data slots:
Slot 1: the agents:
 ?= agentMatrix class (defined externally, NetlogoR S4 class);
Slot 2: the path traveled by the agents:
 ? = a data frame: (x, y, id);
 ?- my current code: defines only the agents ("t");
setClass("agentsWithPath", contains = c(t="agentMatrix"));

1.b.) Attribute with colors specific for each agent
- should be probably an attribute attached to the agentMatrix and not a 
proper data slot;
Note:
- it is currently an attribute on the path data.frame, but I will 
probably change this once I get the S4 class properly implemented;
- the agentMatrix does NOT store the colors (which are stored in another 
class - but it is useful to have this information available with the 
agents);

2.) plot & line methods for this class
plot.agentsWithPath;
lines.agentsWithPath;


I somehow got stuck with the S4 class definition. Though it may be a 
good opportunity to learn about S4 classes (and it is probably better 
suited as an S4 class than polynomials).


The GitHub code draws the agents, but was somehow hacked together. For 
anyone interested:

https://github.com/discoleo/R/blob/master/Stat/ABM.Models.Particles.R


Many thanks,


Leonard

I'm a bit unsure about your premise. If I understand correctly, the
data for the last week is incomplete and may change. When it does, the
loess smooth is potentially affected for the preceding weeks as well
(in your case, with span = 0.3, upto around 30% of the preceding
weeks). So wouldn't it be misleading to suggest that the smoother
lines are "tentative" only for the last week or two?

It makes more sense to me to just highlight the last data point as
(potentially) incomplete.

Best,
-Deepayan

Well, of course Deepayan is right. But perhaps worth noting is that the
U.S. government and presumably many others publishes tons of economic
estimates of time series that are revised as later data comes in --
employment statistics were a recent prominent example that made the news.

I leave it to the OP to figure out how he wants to deal with these
statistical realities. The simple truth is that simple truth may be
unattainable.

Best,
Bert

Hello,
I have generated a contourplot with lattice. How do I set the line
width? I tried with:
```
library(lattice)
contourplot(Z ~ X*Y, data = df, cuts = 3,
panel=function(x,y,...){
panel.contourplot(lty=1, lwd = 3)
})
```
but did not work...
Thank you

sorry, it was easier than expected: just add `lwd` to the main cal.
sorry I could not stop the message before checking...

Message-ID: <CAMk+s2Qqb8y_BzfQmBG4nUUmEz=OYJtVWVgyT36SU1C+nKHOzg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I have a dataframe with 3 variables. I want to loop through it to get
the mean value of the variable `z`, as follows:
```
df = data.frame(x = c(rep(1,5), rep(2,5), rep(3,5)),
y = rep(letters[1:5],3),
z = rnorm(15),
stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
m = vector()
for (i in unique(df$y)) {
s = df[df$y == i,]
m = append(m, mean(s$z))
}
names(m) = unique(df$y)
> (m)
a          b          c          d          e
-0.6355382 -0.4218053 -0.7256680 -0.8320783 -0.2587004
```
The problem is that I have one million `y` values, so the work takes
almost a day. I understand that vectorization will speed up the
procedure. But how shall I write the procedure in vectorial terms?
Thank you

If I follow what you are trying to do, you want the mean of z for each value of y.

tapply(df$z, df$y, mean)

Have a look at the base functions tapply and aggregate.

For example see:
- 
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#The-function-tapply_0028_0029-and-ragged-arrays 
,
- https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat484/lesson/9/9.2,
- or ?tapply and ?aggregate.

Also your current code seems to contain an error: `s = df[df$y == i,]` 
should be `s = df$z[df$y == i]` I think.

HTH,
Jan

Subject: [R] R lattice contourplot: select only specific values
Message-ID: <CAMk+s2SwKTKX8v42OvRjdK7MUuOHpDmjEMf2Vp3JxUrJGY5+sg@mail.gmail.com>

I have a dataframe of three variables: x, y, z. The value of z are:
```
> unique(df$z)
[1] 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.6 3.0 2.4 2.8
```
I would like to plot the contour where the data get integer values
(1.0, 2.0, 3.0) but also highlight where the 1.8 and 2.8 values
occurred. Thus, I am plotting the data with lattice's contourplot with
a cut of 3,  and I would like to add a layer with the contours for the
2.8 values. A sort of mean and 95% CI margins around it.
I selected a subset of the original dataframe, but it does not plot anything.
```
library(lattice)
library(latticeExtra)
ds = subset(df, z == 1.8 | z == 2.8)
a = contourplot(z ~ y*x, data = df, cuts = 3, lwd = 3, labels=FALSE)
b = contourplot(Class ~ y*x, data = ds, lwd = 1, col="blue")
P = a + as.layer(b)
print(P)
```

Is there a way to select only a subset of the contours? If I increase
`cuts` I get more levels, I am only interested in certain values...
Thank you

Subject: [R] How to create a proper S4 class?
In-Reply-To: <66a496db-7d5d-6ffa-ee2b-eea3eb9ea033@syonic.eu>

Hi Leonard --

Remember that a class can have 'has a' and 'is a' relationships. For instance, a People class might HAVE slots name and age

.People <- setClass(
    "People",
    slots = c(name = "character", age = "numeric")
)

while an Employees class might be described as an 'is a' relationship -- all employeeds are people -- while also having slots like years_of_employment and job_title

.Employees <- setClass(
    "Employees",
    contains = "People",
    slots = c(years_of_employment = "numeric", job_title = "character")
)

I've used .People and .Employees to capture the return value of setClass(), and these can be used as constructors

people <- .People(
   name = c("Simon", "Andre"),
   age = c(30, 60)
)

employees = .Employees(
    people, # unnamed arguments are class(es) contained in 'Employees'
    years_of_employment = c(3, 30),
    job_title = c("hard worker", "manager")
)

I would not suggest using attributes in addition to slots. Rather, embrace the paradigm and represent attributes as additional slots. In practice it is often helpful to write a constructor function that might transform between formats useful for users to formats useful for programming, and that can be easily documented.

Employees <-
    function(name, age, years_of_employment, job_title)
{
    ## implement sanity checks here, or in validity methods
    people <- .People(name = name, age = age)
    .Employees(people, years_of_employment = years_of_employment, job_title = job_title)
}

plot() and lines() are both S3 generics, and the rules for S3 generics using S4 objects are described in the help page ?Methods_for_S3. Likely you will want to implement a show() method; show() is an S4 method, so see ?Methods_Details. Typically this should use accessors rather than relying on direct slot access, e.g.,

person_names <- function(x) x at name
employee_names <- person_names

The next method implemented is often the [ (single bracket subset) function; this is relatively complicated to get right, but worth exploring.

I hope that gets you a little further along the road.

    Dear List-Members,


    I want to create an S4 class with 2 data slots, as well as a plot and a 
    line method.


    Unfortunately I lack any experience with S4 classes. I have put together 
    some working code - but I presume that it is not the best way to do it. 
    The actual code is also available on Github (see below).


    1.) S4 class
    - should contain 2 data slots:
    Slot 1: the agents:
      = agentMatrix class (defined externally, NetlogoR S4 class);
    Slot 2: the path traveled by the agents:
       = a data frame: (x, y, id);
      - my current code: defines only the agents ("t");
    setClass("agentsWithPath", contains = c(t="agentMatrix"));

    1.b.) Attribute with colors specific for each agent
    - should be probably an attribute attached to the agentMatrix and not a 
    proper data slot;
    Note:
    - it is currently an attribute on the path data.frame, but I will 
    probably change this once I get the S4 class properly implemented;
    - the agentMatrix does NOT store the colors (which are stored in another 
    class - but it is useful to have this information available with the 
    agents);

    2.) plot & line methods for this class
    plot.agentsWithPath;
    lines.agentsWithPath;


    I somehow got stuck with the S4 class definition. Though it may be a 
    good opportunity to learn about S4 classes (and it is probably better 
    suited as an S4 class than polynomials).


    The GitHub code draws the agents, but was somehow hacked together. For 
    anyone interested:

Subject: [R] Help with strange RGui behavior? Will not consistently run

Message-ID: <CAEyofh9W8WaWG=FqJYecG8NE=mCoNjGHE4BF1NxwUw+SoHkc=Q@mail.gmail.com>

So I've got an odd problem that I can't seem to nail down, and I'm not
totally sure even where I should go to ask about it. Hopefully this mailing
list is acceptable, and please do let me know if not.

I'm using the "Rgui.exe" interface for R in windows 10. I've used this for
more than a decade now with no problems, and for at least a year on this
computer specifically. But now, when I click "Run line or selection" or
equivalently use CTRL+R, it only sometimes runs the selection.
Specifically: the FIRST time I attempt to run any given selection, it

This issue only appears when I drag to select a snippet of text. It works
fine when I simply click on a line without selecting it. However, if I drag
and select a region of code and hit the command, the selection stops being
selected but it does not run the code. If I then drag and select the exact
same code a second time and do it again, it runs normally. If instead of
running the same code again I attempt to select different code, it once
again does not run.

Here's the really odd bit: this affects multiple installations of R. I have
multiple versions of R installed on my machine for testing purposes (R
3.4.4, 3.6.1, and 4.1.2), and this issue suddenly appeared simultaneously
on all three.

I've tested it hundreds of times in various situations on all three
installations and it is extremely consistent but utterly unreproducible. I
have a second computer with R installed that works normally, and I have
tried doing the exact same thing on that computer and it behaves as
expected.

It's not a hotkey capture issue or a hardware since it doesn't matter if I
use the hotkey or use the right-click menu. So far as I can tell nothing
else has changed. Are there hidden options in Rgui, or is there like an
Rprofile file or something somewhere that all the R installations will run
on startup? Are there R commands that alter options in the gui itself?

I'm not even sure who I should contact or what list I should use, since
this isn't really an issue with the R programming language itself but
rather an issue with the GUI. The issue doesn't involve any keywords that I
can think of to search for others with the same issue ("run R on selection"
appears a lot in unrelated pages).

Hi Stephen,
Does the problem still occur if you connect remotely to your computer from
a different computer?
e.g. via remote desktop?

Your code is unnecessarily complex.
contourplot() will by default use the panel.contourplot() function and pass
down graphical arguments to it.

So this suffices:
contourplot(Z ~ X*Y, data = df, cuts = 3, lwd =2)

Customization of the panel function appears to be unnecessary for your
needs.

Try using at=c(1.8, 2.8) to specify the contour levels you want (and omit
the cuts= argument).

It didn't work because you left out the ... on the inside.

it should be
panel.contourplot(..., lty=1, lwd = 3)

As Bert pointed out, you don't need to specify the panel function unless you are doing something complex.

Thank you! yes, I thought line width was controlled by some kind of
panel function...

Dear Martin,


thank you very much for the guidance.


Ultimately, I got it running. But, for mysterious reasons, it was 
challenging:

- I skipped for now the inheritance (and used 2 explicit non-inherited 
slots): this is still unresolved; [*]

- the code is definitely cleaner;


[*] Mysterious errors, like:

"Error in cbind(deparse.level, ...) :
 ? cbind for agentMatrix is only defined for 2 agentMatrices"


One last question pops up:

If B inherits from A, how can I down-cast back to A?

b = new("B", someA);

??? as.A(b) ???

Is there a direct method?

I could not explore this, as I am still struggling with the inheritance. 
The information may be useful, though: it helps in deciding the design 
of the data-structures. [Actually, all base-methods should work natively 
as well - but to have a solution in any case.]


Sincerely,


Leonard

Hi,

This issue bears some similarity to a problem I?ve been experiencing over the last few days. R 4.0.3, Windows 10, RGui. My ability to adjust window dimensions took a serious slide (cursor on edge or corner, click and tug). Usually only works now if I pause for awhile after the click before moving the cursor, while it used to work immediately every time. Similarly my ability to select text with a scroll became more difficult, but shift-clicking works fine. I just assumed my mouse was succumbing to age (still think that likeliest), or possibly related to the last Windows update a few days back (coincidental timing). So I doubt this is pertinent but thought I should mention it just in case.

Hi Stephen,
Does the problem still occur if you connect remotely to your computer from
a different computer?
e.g. via remote desktop?

From my example, 

  as(employees, "People")

more general coercion is possible; see the documentation ?setAs.

From your problem description I would have opted for the solution that you now have, with two slots rather than inheritance. Inheritance has a kind of weird contract when using another package, where you're agreeing to inherit whatever generics and methods are / will be defined on the object, by any package loaded by the user; a usual benefit of object-oriented programming is better control over object type, and this contract seems to total undermine that.

I actually don't know how to navigate the mysterious error; the secret is somewhere in the cbind / cbind2 documentation, but this seems quite opaque to me.

    Dear Martin,


    thank you very much for the guidance.


    Ultimately, I got it running. But, for mysterious reasons, it was 
    challenging:

    - I skipped for now the inheritance (and used 2 explicit non-inherited 
    slots): this is still unresolved; [*]

    - the code is definitely cleaner;


    [*] Mysterious errors, like:

    "Error in cbind(deparse.level, ...) :
       cbind for agentMatrix is only defined for 2 agentMatrices"


    One last question pops up:

    If B inherits from A, how can I down-cast back to A?

    b = new("B", someA);

    ??? as.A(b) ???

    Is there a direct method?

    I could not explore this, as I am still struggling with the inheritance. 
    The information may be useful, though: it helps in deciding the design 
    of the data-structures. [Actually, all base-methods should work natively 
    as well - but to have a solution in any case.]


    Sincerely,


    Leonard

Likely you will want to implement a show() method; show() is an S4 method, so see ?Methods_Details. Typically this should use accessors rather than relying on direct slot access, e.g.,

Those two indicies are "" in the dtpaigd list. So they're skipped. 
That's what coalesce does.


If you want to push the values from dtpmgd into dtpaigd, wherever 
dtpaigd is an empty string, maybe this will help:


dt_combined <- ifelse(dtpaigd == "", dtpmgd, dtpaigd)


>> dput(dtpaigd)

I have not tried that. I'm not certain if I have the permissions for remote
desktop, but I will find out and give it a shot if possible.

HI Stephen,
The reason I suggested the test was that I had a real flakey and
annoying GUI problem a couple of years ago.
It had to do with selection by mouse etc. The IT group could not
reproduce the problem (when they connected remotely) and I realized
that when I worked from home I also avoided the problem.
By fluke I found that when the problem arose I could "fix it"
(temporarily) by disconnecting/reconnecting my USB keyboard. My point
is that the problem was some weird interaction between hardware and
software. Eventually the problem more or less disappeared with some
updated version of Windows 10. (I was somewhat relieved to find that a
lot of people were complaining of the same symptoms, but no one could
provide a fix that worked for me.)

Good luck!

Usually only works now if I pause for awhile after the click before moving the cursor, while it used to work immediately every time. Similarly my ability to select text with a scroll became more difficult, but shift-clicking works fine. I just assumed my mouse was succumbing to age (still think that likeliest), or possibly related to the last Windows update a few days back (coincidental timing). So I doubt this is pertinent but thought I should mention it just in case.

I haven't been able to get remote desktop working, I suspect it's disabled
for security reasons.

Any other thoughts/suggestions?

Hello,

Use an index giving the "" positions.


i <- nchar(dtpmgd) == 0L
dtpmgd[i] <- dtpaigd[i]



Or, in one line,


dtpmgd[nchar(dtpmgd) == 0L] <- dtpaigd[nchar(dtpmgd) == 0L]



Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Hi RosalinaZakaria,
Talk about using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. In your example the
two objects are character vectors. How about:

dt_comb1gd <-paste0(dtpaigd,dtpmgd)

Subject: [R] the opposite of pluck() in purrr
Message-ID: <7a70a5fe-3319-520e-e1f5-7bbabfc6e771@binghamton.edu>

I've just learned about pluck() and chuck() in the purrr package. Very
cool!  As I understand it, they both will return one element of a list,
either by name or by [[]] index, or even "first"  or "last"

I was hoping to find a way to return all *but* one specified element of
a list. Speaking loosely, pluck(-1) or pluck(!1) or !pluck(1), but none
of those of course work. Thinking of English language, I had hopes for
chuck(1) as in "chuck element 1 away, leaving the rest"  but that's now
how it works.

Any tidyverse-centric ways to return all except one specified element of
a list?

Thanks.

tidyverse is an RStudio ecosystem of packages -- it is not part of R's
"standard" package distro, so as the posting guide linked below says:

"For questions about functions in standard packages distributed with R (see
the FAQ Add-on packages in R
<https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Add-on-packages-in-R>), ask
questions on R-help.
If the question relates to a *contributed package* , e.g., one downloaded
from CRAN, try contacting the package maintainer first. You can also use
find("functionname") and packageDescription("packagename") to find this
information. *Only* send such questions to R-help or R-devel if you get no
reply or need further assistance. This applies to both requests for help
and to bug reports."

While you may nevertheless get lucky here, a better bet is to post on
RStudio's own forum, set up specifically to provide such help:
https://community.rstudio.com/

Cheers,

Bert Gunter

Why (on earth!) hand-cuff yourself to someone else's prescription of
how things should be done?  Why not just do it yourself, especially
given that it's so easy in this instance?

Use mung[[1]] to get the first entry of a list named "mung".
Or mung[1] of one if you want a *list* whose sole entry is the
first entry of mung.

Likewise mung[-1] will give you the "all but" results.
Fewer key strokes, even.  Tell tidyverse/purrr to pluck off! :-)

cheers,

As noted, this is not the place to ask about dplyr but the answer you may
want is perhaps straight R.

If you have a list called weekdays and you know you o not want to take the
fifth, then indexing with -5 removes it:

> weekdays <- list("Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat")
> weekdays[-5]
[[1]]
[1] "Sun"

[[2]]
[1] "Mon"

[[3]]
[1] "Tue"

[[4]]
[1] "Wed"

[[5]]
[1] "Fri"

[[6]]
[1] "Sat"

In general, any function you use to get one or more indices can be used sort
of like this:

> odder <- seq(from=1, to=length(weekdays), by=2)
> weekdays[-odder]
[[1]]
[1] "Mon"

[[2]]
[1] "Wed"

[[3]]
[1] "Fri"

So do you need to really search for dplyr functionality, such as how to take
all but some in a list  in a pipeline. use the odd function `[` to access
the subset.

> weekdays %>% `[`(-5)
[[1]]
[1] "Sun"

[[2]]
[1] "Mon"

[[3]]
[1] "Tue"

[[4]]
[1] "Wed"

[[5]]
[1] "Fri"

[[6]]
[1] "Sat"

> weekdays %>% `[`(odder)
[[1]]
[1] "Sun"

[[2]]
[1] "Tue"

[[3]]
[1] "Thu"

[[4]]
[1] "Sat"

Computing the wrong distances is a serious problem. Perhaps you could
take a chance at contacting the original package author via
https://www.gmge.org/ ? Perhaps Georg M. Goerg could be persuaded to
publish this small fix.

Message-ID: <CAGxFJbSsyG6Nv=pbJ3GGqk4v2PZuWjpkLoOF+JJZe3W=Q6=K=w@mail.gmail.com>

A long-ish article on code/data-analysis reproducibility in scientific
research for those of you who may be interested. Questions related to this
occasionally appear on this list. R is mentioned. Apologies if I have
strayed too far.

https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/11/keeping-science-reproducible-in-a-world-of-custom-code-and-data/

Rhetorical question: What does "reproducibility" mean for (complex)
simulation studies?

Because this is off-topic, if you care to respond, please do so to me
privately, off-list.

Best,
Bert Gunter

 Dear All:



I am conducting a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) for the attached data.
Here is what I did. please see below

I do need your help with the structure of the model. I believe that what I
used is the correlated CFA model. If I am wrong, please fix me. I need your
help with the structure of the CFA uncorrelated model.



Thank you very much for your help in advance

Please read the posting guide linked below, which says:

"Questions about statistics: The R mailing lists are primarily
intended for questions and discussion about the R software. However,
questions about statistical methodology are sometimes posted. If the
question is well-asked and of interest to someone on the list, it may
elicit an informative up-to-date answer."

Also note:

"For questions about functions in standard packages distributed with R
(see the FAQ Add-on packages in R), ask questions on R-help.
If the question relates to a contributed package , e.g., one
downloaded from CRAN, try contacting the package maintainer first. You
can also use find("functionname") and
packageDescription("packagename") to find this information. Only send
such questions to R-help or R-devel if you get no reply or need
further assistance. This applies to both requests for help and to bug
reports."

So do not be surprised if you do not get a response here. Cross Validated, i.e.
stats.stackexchange.com
*might* be a better alternative.

Cheers,
Bert Gunter

Subject: [R] Predictably puzzled.
Message-ID: <20211120151214.76232e19@rolf-Latitude-E7470>


Consider the following toy example:

    set.seed(42)
    y <- rnorm(20)
    x <- rnorm(20)
    y[c(3,5,14,15)] <- NA
    fit <- lm(y~x)
    predict(fit)

This for some reason, which escapes me, does not provide predicted
values when the response/dependent variable is missing, despite
there being no missing values in the predictor/independent variable.

I can get predicted values for all values of x if I set

    ddd <- data.frame(y=y,x=x)

and execute

    predict(fit,newdata=ddd)

Note that y is (unnecessarily) included in ddd.  I thought that
predict() might omit any rows of the data in which there are missing
values, but not so.

OK.  I have a workaround which gives me the predicted values that I
want, but:

(a) Why does predict() behave in this way?  It makes no sense to me,
but I figure there *must* be a rationale.

(b) Is there a way of getting predict() to behave as I would like, by
specifying an appropriate value for na.action?  I could not find such
an appropriate value.

Thanks for any enlightenment.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

?predict.lm says:

model.frame(fit) is:

All you need is predict(fit, data.frame(x)) or if you had started with
a data frame:

xy <- data.frame(x, y)
fit <- lm(y~x, xy)
predict(fit, xy)

I have named NUMEROUS objects (each containing, e.g., 48 obs. of 5 
variables), such as
 ? mec1.p.emb
 ? mec2.p.emb
 ? meb1.p.emb
 ? meb2.p.emb
 ? mej12.p.emb
 ? mej22.p.emb

How would I rename these objects removing the silly ".emb", into objects
 ? mec1.p
 ? mec2.p
 ? meb1.p
 ? meb2.p
 ? mej12.p
 ? mej22.p

Thank you!

Use a global search and replace on your source code, and create them 
with the correct names.

Hello,

You can get all objects to be changed into a list, change the list's 
names attribute and assign back to the globalenv. Something like the 
following.
First see if the objects exist in the global env.

ls()
#[1] "meb1.p.emb"  "meb2.p.emb"  "mec1.p.emb"  "mec2.p.emb"
#[5] "mej12.p.emb" "mej22.p.emb"


Now the code to change their names



# create a vector of names of the objects
# whose names are to be changed
obj_names <- ls(pattern = "\\.emb$")

# this is instruction is not strictly needed
# it's meant to check if the regex works (it does)
sub("\\.emb$", "", obj_names)
#[1] "meb1.p"  "meb2.p"  "mec1.p"  "mec2.p"  "mej12.p" "mej22.p"

# get the objects into a list
tmp_list <- mget(obj_names, envir = .GlobalEnv)
# change the list's names
names(tmp_list) <- sub("\\.emb$", "", obj_names)
# assign them to the global environment
list2env(tmp_list, envir = .GlobalEnv)

# clean up
rm(tmp_list)
rm(list = obj_names)

# check to see if it worked (it did)
ls()
#[1] "meb1.p"  "meb2.p"  "mec1.p"  "mec2.p"  "mej12.p" "mej22.p"


Hope this helps,

Agreed... This Is The Way.

To interactively sit at the R console and type in commands without keeping those commands in an editor and running them from scratch periodically to insure that they achieve your goals is a only a recipe for mystery, not for data analysis.

R is a tool for transforming raw data into i interpretable forms. If you are not keeping track of how you used it, how can you convince yourself or others that you did it right? And if you are keeping track, then you should feel comfortable editing that set of transformation steps so they do the right thing the first time.

Please read and follow the posting guide linked below, which says:

"For questions about functions in standard packages distributed with R
(see the FAQ Add-on packages in R), ask questions on R-help.
If the question relates to a contributed package , e.g., one
downloaded from CRAN, try contacting the package maintainer first. You
can also use find("functionname") and
packageDescription("packagename") to find this information. Only send
such questions to R-help or R-devel if you get no reply or need
further assistance. This applies to both requests for help and to bug
reports."

You might check to see if the package has its own help resources. Some do.

Subject: [R] Date read correctly from CSV, then reformatted incorrectly by R
Message-ID: <CAMVDa_7AH3sEaGMQvLB2zWuCwj5FAgjByhc8V+9QjxE07tdT-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Simple but infuriating problem.

Reading in CSV of data using :

```
# CSV file has column headers with date of scene capture in format
dd/mm/yyyy
# check.names = FALSE averts R incorrectly processing dates due to '/'
data <- read.csv("C:/R_data/Bungala (b2000) julian.csv", check.names =
FALSE)

# Converts data table from wide (many columns) to long (many rows) and
creates the new object 'data_long'
# Column 1 is the 'Buffer' number (100-2000), Columns 2-25 contain monthly
data covering 2 years (the header row being the date, and rows 2-21 being a
value for each buffer).
# Column headers for columns 2:25 are mutated into a column called 'Date',
values for each buffer and each date into the column 'LST'
data_long <- data %>% pivot_longer(cols = 2:25, names_to = "Date",
values_to = "LST")

# Instructs R to treat the 'Date' column data as a date
data_long$Date <- as.Date(data_long$Date)
```

Using str(data), I can see that R has correctly read the dates in the
format %d/%m/%y (e.g. 15/12/2015) though has the data type as chr.

Once changing the type to 'Date', however, the date is reconfigured.  For
instance, 15/01/2010 (15 January 2010), becomes 0015-01-20.

I've tried ```data_long$Date <- as.Date(data_long$Date, format =
"%d/%m.%y")```, and also ```tryformat c("%d/%m%y")```, but either the error
persists or I get ```NA```.

How do I make R change Date from 'chr' to 'date' without it going wrong?

Suggestions/hints/solutions would be most welcome.  :)

Thanks for your time,

Hi Philip,
This is a recurring question and there are many ways to do this.
My preference is to use the lubridate package.

library(lubridate)
a <- "15/01/2010"
b <- dmy(a)
b
# "2010-01-15"
class(b)
# [1] "Date"

HTH,
Eric

a) R data frames are column oriented. Do not fight this.

b) Data frame header names are character type. Period. Do not fight this.

It sounds like you need to reshape your data after you read it in. Provide the first five lines of your CSV file (or a reasonable facsimile if your data are confidential) and someone (me if I get to it first) can help make it more adapted to R.

Also, make sure you configure your email software to send plain text... formatted email gets damaged to varying degrees by the automatic stripping of formatting performed by the mailing list. And periodically read the Posting Guide for other advice.

Thanks Eric & Jeff.

I'll certainly read up on lubridate, and the posting guide (again)
(this should be in plain text).

The as.Date function for a character class argument will try reading in two
formats (%Y-%m-%d and %Y/%m/%d).


This does not look like the format you have provided, which is why it
doesn't work. Try something like:


x <- c("28/10/2016", "19/11/2016", "31/12/2016", "16/01/2016", "05/03/2017")
as.Date(x, format = "%d/%m/%Y")


which produces this output:


> x <- c("28/10/2016", "19/11/2016", "31/12/2016", "16/01/2016",
"05/03/2017")
> as.Date(x, format = "%d/%m/%Y")
[1] "2016-10-28" "2016-11-19" "2016-12-31" "2016-01-16" "2017-03-05"
>


much better than before! I hope this helps

Beat me to it! But it is also worth noting that once converted to Date or POSIXct, timestamps should be treated as data without regard to how that data is displayed. When you choose to output that data you will have options as to the display format associated with the function you are using for output.

My take:

dta <- read.table( text=
"Buffer    28/10/2016    19/11/2016  31/12/2016    16/01/2017    05/03/2017

Thanks, Andrew.  I didn't realise as.Date *only* read two formats, I
think I was tripped up by using %y instead of %Y, though I also know
that '/' is a special character in R (if that's the right term) and as
such know there is special syntax to use (which I don't know).

Thanks, Jeff.

I follow what you're doing below, but know I need to read up on Date /
POSIXct.  Helpful direction!  :)

When you choose to output that data you will have options as to the display format associated with the function you are using for output.

"I also know that '/' is a special character in R (if that's the right term) "

That is false. I think you are confusing "/" with "\", which is R's
*escape* character.

> cat("a/nb")
a/nb
> cat("a\nb")
a
b

It gets confusing especially in regex's, because "\" is used in regex
syntax also.

This seems to be a topic that comes up periodically. The various ways in R
and other packages for reading in data often come with methods that simply
guess wrong or encounter one or more data items in a column that really do
not fit so fields may just by default become a more common denominator of
character or perhaps floating point.

There are ways that some such programs can be given a hint of what you
expect or even be supplied with a way to coerce them into what you want
while being read in. But realistically, often a more practical  method might
be to take the data.frame variety you read in and before using it for other
purposes, check it for validity and make any needed changes. Simplistic ones
might be to see how many columns were read in to see if it matches
expectations or generate an error. Or you may trim columns (or rows) that
are not wanted.

In that vein, are there existing functions available that will accept what
types you want one or more columns to be in and that validate if the current
type is something else and then convert if needed? I mean we have functions
like as.integer(df$x ) or more flexibly as(df$x, "integer") and you may
simply build on a set of those and create others to suit any special needs.

Of course a good method carefully checks the results before over-writing as
sometimes the result may not be the same length (as shown below) or may
violate some other ideas or rules:

> as(c(NULL, NA, 3, 3.1, "3.1", list(1,2,"a")), "character")
[1] "NA"  "3"   "3.1" "3.1" "1"   "2"   "a"  

So if you have dates in some format, or sometimes an unknown format, there
are ways, including some others have shown, to make them into some other
date format or even make multiple columns that together embody the format.

What people sometimes do is assume software is perfect and should do
anything they want. It is the other way around and the programmer or data
creator has some responsibilities to use the right software on the right
data and that may also mean sanity checks along the way to  see if the data
is what you expect or alter it to be what you need.

Thanks, Jeff.

I follow what you're doing below, but know I need to read up on Date /
POSIXct.  Helpful direction!  :)

output.

 Date read correctly from CSV, then reformatted incorrectly by R
In-Reply-To: <CAMVDa_7AH3sEaGMQvLB2zWuCwj5FAgjByhc8V+9QjxE07tdT-Q@mail.gmail.com>

CSV data is very often strangely laid out.  For analysis,
Buffer Date Reading
100    ...  ...
100    ...  ...
and so on is more like what a data frame should be.  I get
quite annoyed when I finally manage to extract data from a
government agency only to find that my tax money has been
spent on making it harder to access than it needed to be.

(1) You do NOT need any additional library to convert dates.
    ?strptime is quite capable.

(2) Just because reshaping CAN be done in R doesn't mean it
    SHOULD be.  Instead of reading data in as the wrong format
    and then hacking it into shape every time, it makes sense
    to convert the data once and only once, then load the
    converted data.  It took just a couple of minutes to write

      (CSVDecoder read: 'transpose-in.csv') bindOwn: [:source |
        (CSVEncoder write: 'transpose-out.csv') bindOwn: [:target |
          source next bind: [:header | "Label date-1 ... date-n"
            target nextPut: {header first. 'Date'. 'Reading'}.
            [source atEnd] whileFalse: [
              source next bind: [:group |
                group with: header keysAndValuesDo: [:index :reading :date |
                  1 < index ifTrue: [
                    (date subStrings: '/') bind: [:dmy |
                      (dmy third,'-',dmy second,'-',dmy first) bind: [:iso |
                        target nextPut: {group first. iso.
reading}]]]]]]]]]]].

    in another programming language, run it, and turn your example into
Buffer,Date,Reading
100,2016-10-28,2.437110889
100,2016-11-19,-8.69674895
100,2016-12-31,3.239299816
100,2017-01-16,2.443183304
100,2017-03-05,2.346743827
200,2016-10-28,2.524329899
200,2016-11-19,-7.688862068
...
   You could do the same kind of thing easily in Perl, Python, F#, ...
   Then just read the table in using
   read.csv("transpose-out.csv", colClasses = c("integer","Date","numeric"))
   and you're away laughing.

(3) Of course you can do the whole thing in base R.

    h <- read.csv("transpose-in.csv", header=FALSE, nrows=1,
stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
    d <- strptime(h[1,-1], format="%d/%m/%Y")
    b <- read.csv("transpose-in.csv", header=FALSE, skip=1)
    r <- expand.grid(Date=d, Buffer=b[,1])
    r$Result <- as.vector(t(as.matrix(b[,-1])))

    Lessons:
    (A) You don't have to read a CSV file (or any other) all in one piece.
        This pays off when the structure is irregular.
    (B) You don't HAVE to accept or convert column names.
    (C) strptime is your friend.
    (D) expand.grid is particularly handy for "matrix form" CSV data.
    (E) Someone who suggests doing something in another language because
        it is easier can end up with egg on his face when doing the whole
        thing in R turns out to be easier, simpler, and far more obvious.
        (A) really is an important lesson.
    (F) It's *amazing* what you can do in base R.  It is useful to
        familiarise yourself with its capabilities before considering other
        packages.  Compositional data?  Not in base R.  Correspondence
        analysis?  Not in base R.  Data reshaping?  Very much there.

	  I've written Ecfun::asNumericDF to overcome some of the common 
problems with read.data, read.csv, etc.:


https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/Ecfun/versions/0.2-5/topics/asNumericDF


	  I use it routinely to help parse numbers, dates, etc., that are read 
as character. I'm sure it can be improved.  It's on GitHub in case 
anyone would like to take the time to suggest improvements:

	  Hope this helps.

It reads other formats _if you specify them_. After all, no computer (or human) can tell whether 11/03/1959 is November 3 or March 11 without further hinting. So it tries the two ISO-like formats and leaves other cases for the user.

Message-ID: <bf6ddce2-a225-e5b1-ac00-eead599c0a5b@shdawson.com>

Hi,


New to the list, first post.

I have reviewed the file:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/arules/arules.pdf

I am unable to find what I am after, so I am asking the mailing list for 
assistance, please.

I am using arules to accomplish apriori for reviewing some association 
rules work output from a colleague. I have validated I have the exact 
same output as my colleague in the syntax I am running. However, I read 
my colleague has ext listed as FALSE in their parameter specification. I 
would like to set my ext to FALSE on my end, as it is set to TRUE now.

QUESTION
What is the syntax to set my apriori parameter specification for ext to 
FALSE?

Thank you in advance for your assistance.


Kindest Regards,

Greg Williams has a book titled "Data Mining with Rattle and R", which 
has a chapter on association rules and the arules package. Williams' 
Rattle GUI package for R also lets you define an association rules model 
using a graphical interface (which creates the R code for you in the log 
file for Rattle). I use this textbook in one of the MS-level R courses 
that I teach and found it to be a good way to convey these concepts 
especially for those new to R and AI/ML generally.

Hello!

My colleague and I have continually run into this error and would like to better understand why and how to remedy. We have been able to run other regressions, but when we go to run a certain set of variables, we both are getting this message each time we try.

Any insight would be helpful as to 1) why and 2) how to remedy.

Attaching our package as well here if it is helpful:



#This loads the required package. Always select UK Bristol as a CRAN MIRROR / LOCATION

#1. Highlight the below code and run (3rd icon or right click)



require(relaimpo)

install.packages('relaimpo',dep=TRUE)

install.packages('iterators')

install.packages('foreach')


Thanks!

Hello,

You ask a question on a certain regression that exhausts vector memory 
but don't post the regression(s) code (and data, btw).
And load package relaimpo before installing it.

Can you please read the posting guide linked to at the bottom of this 
and every R-Help mail? As is there's nothing to answer to.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

It would help if you provided more information about how exactly you
run this regression (e.g. "I'm running `reg <- lm(y ~ X)`") and what
are the sizes of the matrices involved (e.g. "dim(X) is c(10000,
1000)"). A reproducible example we could run ("When I copy&paste the
following code into my R session, I always get the error") would be
ideal, but it's not always possible.

I'm assuming you run relaimpo::boot.relimp, but with what kind of data?

(Perhaps you had attached an example, but the mailing list ate the
attachment. It eats most kinds of attachments:
https://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html)

Adding more RAM to the computer running R would probably help. If the
code makes excessive copies of data (by taking a large variable,
changing something in it and keeping it referenced, maybe indirectly
via an environment), perhaps it could be restructured to avoid doing
that. I'm afraid it's hard to be more specific without more information.

Subject: [R] read_csv() error I cannot find
Message-ID: <cfde2a82-5052-a989-4378-e6b04ba2e45c@appl-ecosys.com>

Applying read_csv() on certain data files produce this error:
Error in list(site_nbr = col_character(), sampdate = col_date(), param = col_character(),  :
   argument 6 is empty
In addition: Warning messages:
1: The following named parsers don't match the column names: param, unit 
2: The following named parsers don't match the column names: site_nbr, sampdate, param, quant, unit 
3: The following named parsers don't match the column names: site_nbr, sampdate, param, quant, unit

I don't see any argument 6.

My web searches for this error returned nothing relevant.

My syntax for other .csv files with different column titles don't generate
this error.

Here are the head of one data file and the read_csv() command to import it:
$ head upriv-chla.csv 
site_nbr,sampdate,param,quant,unit
10350,1989-07-18,chl-a,2.50,ug/l

10350,1991-10-07,chl-a,4.70,ug/l

upriv_chla <- read_csv("../data/geochem/upriv-chla.csv", col_names = TRUE,
                        col_types = list (
                            site_nbr = col_character(),
                            sampdate = col_date(format = "D"),
                            param = col_character(),
                            quant = col_double(),
                            unit = col_character()
                            ))

Note: I added the date format after seeing the error but that did not fix
the problem.

Running 'grep -axv '.*' upriv-chla.csv' to see if there are non-ASCII
characters in the file shows there aren't any.

I've no idea how to identify the source of this error beyond what I've done.

Suggestions needed.

This typically happens when you leave a trailing comma at the end of a
list() call:

list(
 site_nbr = col_character(),
 sampdate = col_date(format = "D"),
 param = col_character(),
 quant = col_double(),
 unit = col_character(), # <-- this comma causes the error
)

As for the rest of it, I'm not sure. Does read.csv() work on your file?

Yes. I figured that out yesterday but didn't change the draft message. There
no longer are any extraneous commas in the script.

Did the 3 warnings come from three separate calls to read_csv?  If so, can
you identify which files caused the warnings?  E.g., change the likes of
   lapply(files, function(file) read_csv(file, ...))
to
   options(warn=1) # report warnings immediately
   lapply(files, function(file){ cat(file, "\n"); read_csv(file, ...)})
Then look at the first lines of those files and see if they have the
expected column names.

Bill,

No. Yesterday while I tried to find the error source there was only the one
warning. Today there were three.

I moved all but one of the data files to a temporary storage file, sourced
the script, added another data file. No errors are displayed. I thought of
this yesterday but it was late and I put it off and forgot to do this today
until I read your message.

There was one data file that had the parameter name in the header rather
than the string, 'param.' That must have been the source of the error.

Thanks for reminding me to back up and do a step-wise import.

Regards,

Rich

What is the size of OrigData? How much random-access memory does the
computer have? If there's a lot of memory, are you running a 32-bit or

Which function call crashes with "vector memory exhausted", the lm()
one, the calc.relimp() one, or some other one? What does traceback()
show after the error?

Subject: [R] Help needed to understand an error message produced from furrr
 and future packages
Message-ID: <520b17eb-6ca7-546c-8a93-8acf41ba16ef@e-mail.jp>

Dear R-users

I need help to understand the error message from furrr function.
I am trying to build a parallel compute system which combines two
desktop computers, one of which is a host computer, and runs ubuntu
over wsl2, and the other is a slave, which runs ubuntu. as its OS.
They are mutually connected on LAN.

The host computer has 8 physical cores (16 logical cores), and the
slave has 4 physical cores(8 logical cores).

I wrote a code chunk, which is;

 > nodes<-c(rep("localhost",7),rep("192.168.1.11",4))
 > plan(list(tweak(cluster, workers = nodes),tweak(multicore,workers=2)))
 > system.time(VCtransfrm("typeIII"))

in which VCtransfrm() is the target function, in which future_pmap and 
future_map
are being called tporogically.?? The variable "typeIII" shows the file 
which is sent to
the VCtransfrm function. the typeIII file is the largest and has 165MB 
of data while
a typeII file is smaller and has only 7 MB of data.

The chunk runs just fine when the typeII data is fed.? However, when the 
typeIII data
was fed, it gave the following error messages? and returned to the R 
prompt.? Oddly,
multiple R sessions were still running under the host computers when I 
obsered its
behaviour by the top command of ubuntu.? The error messages are:

Error in unserialize(node$con) :
 ? ClusterFuture (<none>) failed to receive results from cluster 
RichSOCKnode #10 (PID 47955 on localhost ?localhost?). The reason 
reported was ?error reading from connection?. Post-mortem diagnostic: No 
process exists with this PID, i.e. the localhost worker is no longer 
alive. Detected a non-exportable reference (?externalptr?) in one of the 
globals (?...furrr_fn? of class ?function?) used in the future 
expression. The total size of the 8 globals exported is 3.77 MiB. The 
three largest globals are ?...furrr_chunk_args? (3.30 MiB of class 
?list?), ?...furrr_fn? (456.55 KiB of class ?function?) and 
?...furrr_map_fn? (11.91 KiB of class ?function?)
Timing stopped at: 2.285 4.291 37.53

I hastily add that the part of "multicore" in the chunk is changed to 
"multisession",
the chunk runs without a problem even when the typeIII file is fed.

I need to understand what this messages mean and how to fix this 
problem?Since
the chunk runs just fine for the smaller data, I reasoned that the 
problem could not
be a logical matter of the code.

Please direct me to the solution of the problem.
Any suggestion will be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

Hiroto

Hello,

Here is your code, simplified and maybe corrected.
Some previous notes:

1. You don't need to attach()

2. You don't need to create categorydata<- as.data.frame(OrigData), 
read.csv already outputs a data.frame. In the code below, I use Origdata.

3. The file has many missing values, so I have cleaned the data. The 
code lines with the new pipe operator (R 4.1.0) give the dim of OrigData 
after cleansing and create the data.frame CleanData, with all complete 
rows, no missing values. There are a total of 968 rows with missing 
values so CleanData only has 840 rows.

4. Instead of having a very long regression formula, I use grep to get 
the column names starting with "B6_" and then a series of paste 
assembles the regression formula.



library(relaimpo)

# Read the data in. I've downloaded it to this directory
path <- "~/tmp"
filename <- "BB HTTF stacked B1, B3, B5, B6, C9 + FILTERED.csv"
filename <- file.path(path, filename)
OrigData <- read.csv(filename)

###### BRAND PERFORMANCE ADVOCACY (B5) ####

# Runs a standard linear regression.

resp <- "B5"
regr_names <- grep("B6_", names(OrigData), value = TRUE)
regr <- paste(regr_names, collapse = " + ")
fmla <- as.formula(paste(resp, regr, sep = " ~ "))

dim(OrigData)
#[1] 1808   63
OrigData[c(resp, regr_names)] |> na.omit() |> dim()
#[1] 840  28

CleanData <- OrigData[c(resp, regr_names)] |> na.omit()

linmod4 <- lm(fmla, data = OrigData, na.action = na.exclude)
linmod4_b <- lm(fmla, data = CleanData)

all(coef(linmod4) == coef(linmod4_b))
#[1] TRUE

# Runs Shapley Value Regression with all the
# coefficients set to sum a hundred

# Any of these first two equivalent forms
# take a very long time
f4_lmg <- calc.relimp(
   linmod4_b,
   type = "lmg",
   rela = TRUE
)
f4_lmg_b <- calc.relimp(
   formula = fmla,
   type = "lmg",
   rela = TRUE,
   data = CleanData
)

# These equivalent forms are quickly done
f4_firstlast <- calc.relimp(
   linmod4_b,
   type = c("first","last"),
   rela = TRUE
)
f4_firstlast_b <- calc.relimp(
   formula = fmla,
   type = c("first","last"),
   rela = TRUE,
   data = CleanData
)

Coefficient4 <- f4_lmg$lmg
Rsq4 <- f4_firstlast$R2
Proportion4 <- Coefficient4 * Rsq4



Hope this helps,

 Help needed to understand an error message produced from furrr

This question is off-topic here (see the Posting Guide, you are asking about a contributed package). Like walking down the street and asking this question, someone might know about it, but most will be puzzled.

You should know that multicore is quite sensitive to which kinds of operations you put into the worker threads, and you may be lucky that it returned an error because it can easily return an invalid result with no error. Getting reliable results with it is a bit of an art and may require detailed knowledge about your OS to avoid trouble with it. I don't claim such knowledge... good luck.

Dear All:



Re: Post-hoc pairwise Fisher?s exact tests with confidence Intervals



I am trying to conduct a Post-hoc pairwise comparison for comparing the
proportions of the ones in the 7 groups using the fisher exact test. I have
a data with 7 variables, data = (0,1). Event = 1.



*Q1.* Is there a way to have the confidence intervals of Pi-Pj in the R
output of the R function ?*pairwise_fisher_test()*?. Also, R yields only
the p values of the first 10 pairs (Pi,Pj).



*Q2.* I used the summary of the raw data, please see below. Is there a way
to use the raw data instead, please see the attached file?



*Q3.* I got an error message when I tried to use the R function ?
*fisher_test()*?





#### R codes





Data1 <- as.table(rbind(

  c(24,9,28,37,18,10,28),                       # number of ones

  c(65,80,61,52,71,79,61)                       # number of zeros

))



dimnames(Data1) <- list(

  cases = c("yes", "no"),

  vars = c("x1", "x2", "x3", "x4", "x5", "x6", "x7")

)



Data1



install.packages("rstatix")

library(rstatix)





fisher_test(Data1, detailed = TRUE)



##### pairwise fisher test: Compare the proportion of ones between groups



pairwise_fisher_test(Data1)







With many thanks

abou

Note the following  alternative to formula paste gymnastics:
## regr_names as in Rui's post
allnames <- c("B5", regr_names)
linmod4 <- lm(B5 ~. , data = OrigData[allnames], na.action = na.exclude)
## or even
linmod4 <- lm(OrigData[allnames], na.action = na.exclude)

see ?formula for details, especially the end of the "Details" section.
But the following should give you some idea of why this works:

> d <- data.frame(a = 1:3, b= runif(3), c = runif(3), d=runif(3))
> formula(d)
a ~ b + c + d
> formula(d[c("b","a","c")])
b ~ a + c

I assume this should also work for your calc.relimp invocations also
(without explicitly invoking formula(...)) , but you'll have to check
of course.
Note also that there may be some negatives to this approach e.g.
perhaps because of greater memory requirements. Others more
knowledgeable (or more ambitious and willing to check) than I will
have to comment if so.

message that the package is not available. Please advise. below is the

You seem to be confused. The package appears to be "prob" containing a
function prob.def1(). If I am correct about this, you need to review
these materials in your course to proceed.

You got messages telling you that some of the package's dependencies
could not be installed. So the package cannot possibly work. Try
uninstalling and reinstalling. After that, I have no idea. I have
cc'ed this to the list so that others may help, which you should
always do unless there is some specific reason not to.

Anyone could write a function named prob.def1, and it is not part of base R so it is off-topic here and there is no way for people on this list to definitively know the answer. As far as Google can tell me it is not from CRAN either. OP should go talk to whoever wrote this code.

Hi Amanze,
The package is apparently "apsurvival", hosted on GitHub:

https://rdrr.io/github/carolinewei/apsurvival/

There seem to be instructions on how to install this, but the
maintainer (Caroline Wei?) doesn't seem to have an email address
listed. Perhaps the easiest thing for you to do is ask your teacher
how to install this package and remember to load it:

library(apsurvival)

after installing when you need the function.

Subject: [R] Large data and space use
References: <00de01d7e3b8$27f5b260$77e11720$.ref@verizon.net>
Message-ID: <00de01d7e3b8$27f5b260$77e11720$@verizon.net>

Several recent questions and answers have mad e me look at some code and I
realized that some functions may not be great to use when you are dealing
with very large amounts of data that may already be getting close to limits
of your memory. Does the function you call to do one thing to your object
perhaps overdo it and make multiple copies and not delete them as soon as
they are not needed?

 

An example was a recent post suggesting a nice set of tools you can use to
convert your data.frame so the columns are integers or dates no matter how
they were read in from a CSV file or created.

 

What I noticed is that often copies of a sort were made by trying to change
the original say to one date format or another and then deciding which, if
any to keep. Sometimes multiple transformations are tried and this may be
done repeatedly with intermediates left lying around. Yes, the memory will
all be implicitly returned when the function completes. But often these
functions invoke yet other functions which work on their copies. You an end
up with your original data temporarily using multiple times as much actual
memory.

 

R does have features so some things are "shared" unless one copy or another
changes. But in the cases I am looking at, changes are the whole idea.

 

What I wonder is whether such functions should clearly call an rm() or the
equivalent as soon as possible when something is no longer needed.

 

The various kinds of pipelines are another case in point as they involve all
kinds of hidden temporary variables that eventually need to be cleaned up.
When are they removed? I have seen pipelines with 10 or more steps as
perhaps data is read in, has rows removed or columns removed or re-ordered
and grouping applied and merged with others and reports generated. The
intermediates are often of similar sizes with the data and if large, can add
up. If writing the code linearly using temp1 and temp2 type of variables to
hold the output of one stage and the input of the text stage, I would be
tempted to add a rm(temp1) as soon as it was finished being used, or just
reuse the same name of temp1 so the previous contents are no longer being
pointed to and can be taken by the garbage collector at some time.

 

So I wonder if some functions should have a note in their manual pages
specifying what may happen to the volume of data as they run. An example
would be if I had a function that took a matrix and simply squared it using
matrix multiplication. There are various ways to do this and one of them
simply makes a copy and invokes the built-in way in R that multiplies two
matrices. It then returns the result. So you end up storing basically three
times the size  of the matrix right before you return it. Other methods
might do the actual multiplication in loops operating on subsections of the
matrix and if done carefully, never keep more than say 2.1 times as much
data around. 

 

Or is this not important often enough? All I know, is data may be getting
larger much faster than memory in our machines gets larger.

First priority is to obtain a correct answer. Second priority is to document it and write tests for it. Third priority is to optimize it. Sometimes it is useful to keep intermediate values around to support supplemental calculations ala "summary", that may or may not lead to using rm where you might think it should be. But often the optimization step is simply neglected.

If you have enough data that running out of memory is a serious problem,
then a language like R or Python or Octave or Matlab that offers you NO
control over storage may not be the best choice.  You might need to
consider Julia or even Rust.

However, if you have enough data that running out of memory is a serious
problem, your problems may be worse than you think.  In 2021, Linux is
*still* having OOM Killer problems.
https://haydenjames.io/how-to-diagnose-oom-errors-on-linux-systems/
Your process hogging memory may cause some other process to be killed.
Even if that doesn't happen, your process may be simply thrown off the
machine without being warned.

It may be one of the biggest problems around in statistical computing:
how to make it straightforward to carve up a problem so that it can be
run on many machines.  R has the 'Rmpi' and 'snow' packages, amongst others.
https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=HighPerformanceComputing

Another approach is to select and transform data outside R.  If you have
data in some kind of data base then doing select and transform in the
data base may be a good approach.

I have successfully used this package (on Linux and macOS) and I think
it is a great way of storing hashed data across different platforms
and programming languages.

See for instance my notes on "Key-value Stores" comparing packages
like 'hash', 'filehash', 'fastmap', or 'rredis' at

https://github.com/hwborchers/LightningTalks/blob/main/key-value_stores/collatz.md

What exactly is your question ?

Subject: [R] Syntax help for 'Pivot_longer'
Message-ID: <CAMVDa_4_ktvBh2rgrKZtnNveCpbOwkrmwbM8aeG=wx3kF=gs5g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a wide table that I transform to a long table for analysis.
The wide table has 25 columns - the first is labels, then columns 2:25
are monthly data of LST which is in 19 rows.

I mutate this with :

data_long <- data %>% pivot_longer(cols = 2:25, names_to =
                                     "Date", values_to = "LST")

I've decided to add some weather data which might be relevant,
inputting this as an additional 7 rows of data in the wide format (see
example below of the first 5 months of data).

I have belatedly realised that I cannot work out how to pivot this
into the long format I need - the documentation doesn't provide enough
syntax examples for me to work it out (I've not long been using 'R').

How do I mutate this to provide the additional columns in the long
table for the weather variables?

Thanks for your time,

Philip

Hi!

If I understood this correctly, you want to pivot the columns from 2 to
25 and use the first column as a "key". Your data has 27 columns in
total, right?

I tested it with your data and seems that the parameter 'cols' does
have some problems. It takes all variables irrespectively of the range
defined. I tired it with '2:25', '2:10' etc. and always the columns nor
included in 'cols' are present in the long table as separate columns.

Could this be an error in the function? Or can someone from the list
explain this, in my eyes a bit unlogical behaviour...

Best,

Kimmo

Often the issue is that different variables in the wide format are of different types so won't simply 
pivot_longer without you making decisions which the function shouldn't make for you.  However, I think
the error messages when that happens are fairly clear so perhaps that's not what's happening here.

I'm happy to have a look at this as I've slowly become a convert to using tidyverse principles and tools
(sometimes seen, legalistically correctly I think, as outside the remit of this Email list) but I agree 
that the help for pivot_longer() and many other tidyverse functions is not as good as it could be particularly
for people new to R.  Often there is better documentation in vignettes (so look for that) or in other things
on the web. 

However, for me the data that was posted are mangled by the post coming in HTML format.  Please read the
list documentation and resubmit the question in raw text Email and submit a bit of your data using 
dput() (see ?dput and search out "R reproducible examples") and then I'll look at it.

Very best (all),

Chris

Questions on "non-standard" packages such as the TidyVerse universe
are off topic here: per the posting guide:

"If the question relates to a contributed package , e.g., one
downloaded from CRAN, try contacting the package maintainer first. You
can also use find("functionname") and
packageDescription("packagename") to find this information. Only send
such questions to R-help or R-devel if you get no reply or need
further assistance. This applies to both requests for help and to bug
reports."

More to the point, RStudio has its own Help site for these questions:
https://www.tidyverse.org/help/  ## and, in particular,
https://community.rstudio.com/

Thanks for your suggestions, Chris.

I'm writing from Gmail's web client, and have checked the message is
being sent as plain text (though I also did this previously so it may
be that I need to change to Outlook).  Let me know if it doesn't work.

Hopefully I've used dput properly (see example below with apologies to
Burt and the PG).   In my defence, I have very limited time due to
caring responsibilities so am time-poor out of necessity rather than
laziness.

Reading the 'pivot_longer' documentation I think I need to use
'names_pattern' to split the weather data into different columns, but
I don't understand the required syntax.

Thanks for your help,

Philip

Richard,

 

I currently have no problem with running out of memory. I was referring to people who have said they use LARGE structures and I am pointing out how they can temporarily get way larger even when not expected. Functions that temporarily will balloon up might come with notifications. And, yes, some transformations may well be doable outside R or in chunks. What gets me is how often users have no idea what happens when they invoke a package.

 

I am not against transformations and needed duplications. I am more interested in whether some existing code might be evaluated and updated in somewhat harmless ways as in removing stuff as soon as it is definitely not needed. Of course there are tradeoffs. I have seen times only one column of a data.frame was needed and the entire data.frame was copied and then returned. That is OK but clearly it might be more economical to ask just for a single column to be changed in place. People often use a sledgehammer when a thumbtack will do.

 

But as noted, R has features that often delay things so a full copy is not made and thus less memory is ever used. But people seem to think that since all ?local? memory is generally returned when the function ends, so why bother micromanaging it as it runs.

 

Arguably, some R packages may make changes in what is kept and for how long. Standard R lets you specify what rows and what columns of a data.frame to keep in a single argument as in df[rows, columns] while something like dplyr offers multiple smaller steps in a grammar of sorts so you do something like a select() followed (often in a pipeline) by a filter() or done in the opposite order. Each additional change is sometimes done by programmers in minimal steps so that a more efficient implementation is harder to do as each one does just one thing well. That may also be a plus, especially if pipelined objects are released in progress and not all at the end of the pipeline.

Subject: Re: [R] Large data and space use

 

If you have enough data that running out of memory is a serious problem,

then a language like R or Python or Octave or Matlab that offers you NO

control over storage may not be the best choice.  You might need to

consider Julia or even Rust.

 

However, if you have enough data that running out of memory is a serious

problem, your problems may be worse than you think.  In 2021, Linux is

*still* having OOM Killer problems.

https://haydenjames.io/how-to-diagnose-oom-errors-on-linux-systems/

Your process hogging memory may cause some other process to be killed.

Even if that doesn't happen, your process may be simply thrown off the

machine without being warned.

 

It may be one of the biggest problems around in statistical computing:

how to make it straightforward to carve up a problem so that it can be

run on many machines.  R has the 'Rmpi' and 'snow' packages, amongst others.

https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=HighPerformanceComputing

 

Another approach is to select and transform data outside R.  If you have

data in some kind of data base then doing select and transform in the

data base may be a good approach.

Several recent questions and answers have mad e me look at some code and I
realized that some functions may not be great to use when you are dealing
with very large amounts of data that may already be getting close to limits
of your memory. Does the function you call to do one thing to your object
perhaps overdo it and make multiple copies and not delete them as soon as
they are not needed?



An example was a recent post suggesting a nice set of tools you can use to
convert your data.frame so the columns are integers or dates no matter how
they were read in from a CSV file or created.



What I noticed is that often copies of a sort were made by trying to change
the original say to one date format or another and then deciding which, if
any to keep. Sometimes multiple transformations are tried and this may be
done repeatedly with intermediates left lying around. Yes, the memory will
all be implicitly returned when the function completes. But often these
functions invoke yet other functions which work on their copies. You an end
up with your original data temporarily using multiple times as much actual
memory.



R does have features so some things are "shared" unless one copy or another
changes. But in the cases I am looking at, changes are the whole idea.



What I wonder is whether such functions should clearly call an rm() or the
equivalent as soon as possible when something is no longer needed.



The various kinds of pipelines are another case in point as they involve all
kinds of hidden temporary variables that eventually need to be cleaned up.
When are they removed? I have seen pipelines with 10 or more steps as
perhaps data is read in, has rows removed or columns removed or re-ordered
and grouping applied and merged with others and reports generated. The
intermediates are often of similar sizes with the data and if large, can add
up. If writing the code linearly using temp1 and temp2 type of variables to
hold the output of one stage and the input of the text stage, I would be
tempted to add a rm(temp1) as soon as it was finished being used, or just
reuse the same name of temp1 so the previous contents are no longer being
pointed to and can be taken by the garbage collector at some time.



So I wonder if some functions should have a note in their manual pages
specifying what may happen to the volume of data as they run. An example
would be if I had a function that took a matrix and simply squared it using
matrix multiplication. There are various ways to do this and one of them
simply makes a copy and invokes the built-in way in R that multiplies two
matrices. It then returns the result. So you end up storing basically three
times the size  of the matrix right before you return it. Other methods
might do the actual multiplication in loops operating on subsections of the
matrix and if done carefully, never keep more than say 2.1 times as much
data around. 



Or is this not important often enough? All I know, is data may be getting
larger much faster than memory in our machines gets larger.

Apologies, all.  No offence was intended.

I'll go away and do a lot more reading and thinking then come back
with a clearly articulated query if and when that is appropriate.
I'm out of time this week, so it won't be for some time.

Thank you all for the helpful replies.

Best wishes,

Philip

Dear R-list users,
I thought I was able to manage easily POSIXct, but this is not true.
I am not going to load the input txt file because I know that attachments are not allowed. The structure of my input txt file is

data_POSIX,Sensor_code,value
2002-11-01 00:00:00,1694,7.2
2002-11-01 00:00:00,1723,10.8
...

I load it with
myfile <- read.table(file="mypath/myfile.txt", header = TRUE, sep=",", dec = ".", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

When I try to convert the data_POSIX column (which is a character) to POSIXct with

myfile$data_POSIX <- as.POSIXct(myfile$data_POSIX, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", tz="Etc/GMT-1")

the outupt is

2002-11-01 1694 7.2
2002-11-01 1723 10.8
...

Why I keep loosing hours, minutes and seconds? Wher eis my mistake or my misunderstanding?

Sorry again if I have not been able to reproduce the R code, and thank you for your support.
Stefano

Hi

You probably has zero hours in all your data

see
> temp
           data_POSIX Sensor_code value
1 2002-11-01 00:00:00        1694   7.2
2 2002-11-01 00:00:00        1723  10.8

without hours
> as.POSIXct(temp$data_POSIX, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", tz="Etc/GMT-1")
[1] "2002-11-01 +01" "2002-11-01 +01"

add value to hours

Voila, hours are back.

So nothing wrong in uyour code, hours are there but they are probably not printed to console and hours are there but hidden. 

Cheers
Petr

Hi,
Petr is right. Apparently as.POSIXct drops the smallest increments if
all are zero:

ssdf<-read.csv(text="data_POSIX,Sensor_code,value
2002-11-01 00:00:01,1694,7.2
2002-11-01 00:00:00,1723,10.8",
stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
ssdf$data_POSIX<-as.POSIXct(ssdf$data_POSIX,"%Y-%m-%d HH:MM:SS")
ssdf

           data_POSIX Sensor_code value
1 2002-11-01 00:00:01        1694   7.2
2 2002-11-01 00:00:00        1723  10.8

but if there is a single small increment, they all show up.

That's not as.POSIXct doing anything:  there's no way to drop 
increments, the POSIXct format records a number of seconds and that 
can't be changed.

What is happening is simply the default formatting.

Be explicit about the format if you want to see the seconds, e.g.

 > format(ssdf$data_POSIX, format = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
[1] "2002-11-01 00:00:00" "2002-11-01 00:00:00"

Hi, 

that is what I tried to show to Stefano. That the issue was only with printing the values on console or as you explained in more depth the default formating when all time values (HMS) are zero.

So that Stefano used correct syntax.

Cheers
Petr

                      ))

The response from R:
source('../scripts/test.r')
Warning message:
The following named parsers don't match the column names: sampdate, param

I searched the web to see if 'temp' is causing the problem and didn't find
an answer; my search term might have been flawed.

If that string is a problem please suggest an alternative.

TIA,

It seems like the headers are misnamed, that should be a comma between
sampdate and param, not a period

In header the row of the sample data file, the column names, "sampdate" 
and "param" are separated by a period, not comma. That would cause the 
error you're getting.

Andrew is right - it's a typo.

More broadly, there's no restriction of that sort on the contents of
your data frame - reserved words can't be used for object names. The R
Language Definition is the best resource for identifying those words.

It would help if you provided the package for read_csv, since not
everyone uses tidyverse by default, although it isn't necessary for
this question.

Andrew,

I completely missed seeing this, probably because I expected a comma and
didn't look closely enough.

Thanks very much for catching this,

Rich

Subject: [R] Question about Rfast colMins and colMaxs
Message-ID: <f6735434-7d5a-c648-c892-0fa1ccc5c774@shdawson.com>

Hi,


I am working to understand the Rfast functions of colMins and colMaxs. I 
worked through the example listed on page 54 of the PDF.

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rfast/index.html

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rfast/Rfast.pdf

My data is in a CSV file. So, I bring it into R Studio using:
Data <- read.csv("./input/DataSet05.csv", header=T)

However, I read the instructions listed on page 54 of the PDF saying I 
need to bring data into R using a matrix. I think read.csv brings the 
data in as a dataframe. I think colMins is failing because it is looking 
for a matrix but finds a dataframe.

 > colMaxs(Data)
Error in colMaxs(Data) :
 ? Not compatible with requested type: [type=list; target=double].
 > colMins(Data, na.rm = TRUE)
Error in colMins(Data, na.rm = TRUE) :
 ? unused argument (na.rm = TRUE)
 > colMins(Data, value = FALSE, parallel = FALSE)
Error in colMins(Data, value = FALSE, parallel = FALSE) :
 ? Not compatible with requested type: [type=list; target=double].

QUESTION
What is the best practice to bring a csv file into R Studio so it can be 
accessed by colMaxs and colMins, please?


Thanks,

Subject: [R] Degree symbol as axis label superscript
Message-ID: <7974ab4-92ad-9a75-98f6-a7914bb8e5@appl-ecosys.com>

I want to present the temperature on the Y-axis label as 'Water Temperature
(oC)' with the degree symbol as a superscript.

My web search found a couple of methods; one put the entire example string
in the axis label, the other is close, but still incorrect.

Source example:
#define expression with superscript
x_expression <- expression(x^3 ~ variable ~ label)
# The example axis label is:
'X3 variable label' (with the 3 as a superscript)

My use:
# Set degree symbol as superscript in plot's y axis:
y_expression <- expression(^o ~ C)

R's error message:
Error in source("../scripts/all_temp_plots.r") :
   ../scripts/all_temp_plots.r:10:28: unexpected '^'
9: # Set degree symbol as superscript in plot's y axis:
10: y_expression <- expression(^
                                ^

What is the proper way to display a degree symbol in a plot's axis label?

RStudio is **not** R. In particular, the so-called TidyVerse consists
of all *non*-standard contributed packages, about which the PG says:

"For questions about functions in standard packages distributed with R
(see the FAQ Add-on packages in R), ask questions on R-help.
[The link is:
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Add-on-packages-in-R
This gives the list of current _standard_ packages]

If the question relates to a contributed package , e.g., one
downloaded from CRAN, try contacting the package maintainer first. You
can also use find("functionname") and
packageDescription("packagename") to find this information. Only send
such questions to R-help or R-devel if you get no reply or need
further assistance. This applies to both requests for help and to bug
reports."

Note that RStudio maintains its own help resources at:
https://community.rstudio.com/
This is where questions about the TidyVerse, ggplot, etc. should be posted.

You can use as.matrix() to convert your data.frame to a matrix, but that
loses the speed/space advantages of colMins (as well as causing issues if
some columns are not numeric).  You could write to the maintainer of the
package to ask that data.frames be directly supported.  In the meantime you
could use

plotmath didn't have the solution; the use of the LaTeX ^ for a superscript
had a character or number preceeding it. Using 'degree' prints that string
on the axis.

What does work is using the unicode for the degree symbol as prefix to
either C or F. In my case:
 	ylab('Water Temperature (\u00B0C)')
does the job.

I found this solution with the DDG search string, 'degree symbol in R plot
axis label'. This stackexchange thread has the answer:

I don't know anything about this package, but read.csv returns a data frame. How you go about forming a matrix using that data frame depends what is in it. If it is all numeric then as.matrix may be all you need.

Half of any R data analysis is data... and the details are almost always crucial. Since you have told us nothing useful about the data, it is up to you to inspect your data and figure out what to do with it.

The following makes degree signs appropriately, as shown in ?plotmath:
    plot(68, 20, xlab=expression(degree*F), ylab=expression(degree*C))
If you want the word "degree" spelled out, put it in quotes.

I think you have to not put the word degree in quotes, something like:


graphics::plot(
    x = 1,

    xlab = quote(
        32 * degree
    )
)


works for me, though yours seems like a good solution too

Really? What was wrong with this?


plot(1, 1, xlab=expression(32^degree) )? # the example given on ?plotmath

Bill,

I missed that last point; thought it was always spelled out.

David,

Absolutely nothing. When there's no specific degree value in the label
because the axis represents a range of values there's no digit preceeding
the ^ symbol.

The axis label is 'Temperature (oC)' with the degree symbol preceeding a
character, not following a specific digit.

True, but unnecessary with UTF-8 encodings of unicode (subject to some
caveats, though):

plot(1:5, runif(5),xlab = "Temp (?F)", ylab = "result")

should work fine, where the ? ("degree") symbol was inserted by the
symbol insertion facility on my Mac. Windows has something similar.
See the comments in the plotmath documentation just before the
examples for more details on this, along with some caveats about the
need for a suitable display/plot device.

More laboriously, but perhaps more informatively, one can look up
"unicode code point for degree symbol" to find that it is decimal 176.
Then R's intToUtf8() function converts this to the UTF-8 encoding that
**should** display as a "degree" symbol, subject to the above
referenced caveats.
Hence:
> intToUtf8(176)
[1] "?"  ##degree character

## So, for example, you can do:
> degrF <-paste0(intToUtf8(176),"F")
> degrF
[1] "?F" ("degrees F")

> plot(1:5, runif(5),xlab = paste0("Temp (", degrF,")"), ylab = "result")

As Andrew said, you can use plotmath to do this, too; it just isn't
needed for simple insertion of "standard" symbols.

NOTE: As I am far from an expert on all of this, I would appreciate
clarification or correction of any errors or misstatements in the
above.

Right, R Studio is not R.

However, the Rfast package is part of R.

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rfast/index.html

So, rephrasing my question...
What is the best practice to bring a csv file into R so it can be 
accessed by colMaxs and colMins, please?

Thanks, Bill.

How do you go about getting maximum and minimum values from your 
columns? Do you simply do them one column at a time? The functions I am 
identifying from Rfast do this work in bulk.

Well, no it is not. The email list stripped off the attachment.

The data is numeric, happens to be all whole numbers.

... but Rfast is *not* a "standard" package, as the rest of the PG
excerpt says. So contact the maintainer and ask him/her what they
think the best practice should be for their package. As has been
pointed out already, it appears to differ from the usual "read it in
as a data frame" procedure.

Oh, you are segmenting standard R from the rest of R.

Well, that part did not come across to me in your original reply. I am 
not clear on a standard versus non-standard list. I will look into this 
aspect and see what I can learn going forward.
