I think this request is like saying "I want a unicorn." There are many organizations that will enter your name into a certificate form for a fee, possibly with some credibility... but if they put "r-project.org" down as the name of the organization granting this "certificate" then you are probably getting fooled.

Hello Jeff !

Yes, you are right.. and that?s why I am asking this question - just like other governing bodies that issue certification on their respective technologies, does "r-project.org" also have a learning path ? and then a certification.

Say - Microsoft issues certificate for C#, .Net, etc..
Then, Oracle issues certificates for Java, DB etc..

These are authentic governing bodies for learning and issuing certificates 

On exactly similar lines -  "r-project.org" would also be having some learning path and then let "r-project" take the proctored exam and issue a certificate...

I am not looking at any external institute for certifying me on "R" - but, the governing body itself..

So, the question again is - "does r-project provide a learning path and issue certificate after taking exams"

Thanks, Mukesh

Hallo Mukesh

R project is not Microsoft or Oracle AFAIK. But if you need some certificate you could take courses on Coursera, they are offering certificates.

Cheers

Thanks Petr !

I will look at other training bodies as Coursera, or few others... but I was just wondering if there could be a  certificate from the "originators" itself, I mean an "R" certificate from "r-project" itself and that would carry more importance than external / unauthorized certificate bodies.

But, if you suggest there is no such certification provided by "r-project", then the only option for me is to search else where like - Coursera or few others.

I now have got my answers, but later the day - if ever "r-project" comes up with "R Language" certifications, do keep me informed.


Thanks, Mukesh

Hi Mukesh,

Have a look at the blurb that prints at the start-up of R.

"R is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY."

This is a hint that the R-Project is unlikely to be issuing certificates.

	  If you go to "https://cran.r-project.org" and click, "Download R for 
macOS", you will find several versions that you can download and that 
have a "digital signature".


	  After downloading, you can "check the integrity of the downloaded 
package by checking the signature: pkgutil --check-signature R-4.2.2.pkg".


	  Beyond that, RStudio and other companies will happily sell you a 
maintenance contract, which will get you more polite answers than from a 
list serve like this ;-)

Will surely do.

Hi Mukesh,

 

Have a look at the blurb that prints at the start-up of R.


"R is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY."

 

This is a hint that the R-Project is unlikely to be issuing certificates.

I will look at other training bodies as Coursera, or few others... but I was just wondering if there could be a  certificate from the "originators" itself, I mean an "R" certificate from "r-project" itself and that would carry more importance than external / unauthorized certificate bodies.

But, if you suggest there is no such certification provided by "r-project", then the only option for me is to search else where like - Coursera or few others.

I now have got my answers, but later the day - if ever "r-project" comes up with "R Language" certifications, do keep me informed.


Thanks, Mukesh

Hallo Mukesh

R project is not Microsoft or Oracle AFAIK. But if you need some certificate you could take courses on Coursera, they are offering certificates.

Cheers
