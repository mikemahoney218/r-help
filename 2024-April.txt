Hi,

why would this simple procedure not work?

--- snip ---
mydf <- data.frame(id_station = 1234, string_data = c(2024, 12, 1, 0, 0),
rainfall_value= 55)

mydf$string_data <- as.factor(mydf$string_data)

values<-as.integer(levels(mydf$string_data))

for (i in 1:length(values)) {?
	assign(paste("VAR_", i, sep=""), values[i])?
}

--- snip ---

Best,

Kimmo

Subject: [R] How to tweak genomic plot with genoPlotR?
Message-ID: <CAMk+s2QBherJTKkzOeJDJ4B4B1mBGsHMv3RSY-C+aeN3d=PJeg@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to use your genoPlotR package
(doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq413) to compare the genomes of two
isolates of E. coli K-12 that I have. One is a K-12 that was in my
lab's fridge; the other is a derivative of K-12 bought some time ago,
HB101.
I tried to use genoPlotR, but I could not understand some functions
from your vignette. I would like to ask you whether you could help me
with this.

I aligned the genomes (reference K-12 plus my isolates) with
`progressiveMauve --weight=15 --output=./K12_Aln.fa K12_multi.fa`,
where K12_multi.fa contains the fasta sequences of the reference and
the consensuses I obtained from my isolates after Illumina NGS. I then
ran this script:

```
## get data
bbone_file = "./K12_Aln.backbone"
bbone = read_mauve_backbone(bbone_file, ref=2)
names(bbone$dna_segs) = c("K-12 ref.", "K-12 Ho", "HB101 Ho")

## calculate lengths
for (i in 1:length(bbone$comparisons)) {
  cmp = bbone$comparisons[[i]]
  bbone$comparisons[[i]]$length = abs(cmp$end1 - cmp$end1) +
                                  abs(cmp$end2 - cmp$end2)
}

## plot
plot_gene_map(dna_segs = bbone$dna_segs,
              comparisons = bbone$comparisons,
              global_color_scheme = c("length", "increasing", "red_blue", 0.7),
              override_color_schemes = TRUE)
```
I got the following plot: https://u.cubeupload.com/Gigiux/Rplot.png
My questions are:
- How can I load the annotations? I have the K-12 annotations in gff3
and genebank formats, but how do I load them in the system so that I
plot it here?
- Is it possible to zoom in?
- Is it possible to change the color scheme?
Thank you

According to https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/genoPlotR/index.html
the maintainer of genoPlotR is

Lionel Guy <lionel.guy at imbim.uu.se>

Send your question also to him.

Using levels rather than length might cause problems. 2024 1, 1, 0, 0 will have a different number of levels than 2024, 3, 8, 0, 0 and I cannot assume that the two tailing zeros are zero for all records. The code can be simplified if you can assume more. It might require more work if I have assumed too much. Maybe there is another data set where the string is something like 2, 2, 2024, 0, 0? Then you need code to figure out the order of values in the string, reorganize it into a common format before trying to merge the data.

The other thing is that values of the string are now different rows. You will need a bit more code to reshape mydf from long to wide. If all of the last two elements of the string are zero, I would remove these from the data first before reshaping.

Hi,

why would this simple procedure not work?

--- snip ---
mydf <- data.frame(id_station = 1234, string_data = c(2024, 12, 1, 0, 0), rainfall_value= 55)

mydf$string_data <- as.factor(mydf$string_data)

values<-as.integer(levels(mydf$string_data))

for (i in 1:length(values)) {
        assign(paste("VAR_", i, sep=""), values[i]) }

--- snip ---

Best,

Kimmo

Note:

[1] "0" "1"

the vector

Does that answer your question or have I misunderstood.

Cheers,

Message-ID: <1006764782.7826419.1712289516806@mail.yahoo.com>

Hello,
I found what looks to me like an odd edge case for duplicated(), unique() etc. on data frames with zero columns, due to duplicated() returning a zero-length vector for them, regardless of the number of rows:
df <- data.frame(a = 1:5)df$a <- NULLnrow(df) # 5 (row count preserved by row.names)duplicated(df) # logical(0), should be c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)anyDuplicated(df) # 0, should be 2nrow(unique(df)) # 0, should be 1
This behaviour isn't mentioned in the documentation; is there a reason for it to work like this?I'm struggling to see this as anything other than unintended behaviour, as a consequence of the do.call(Map, `names<-(c(list, x), NULL)`) expression in duplicated.data.frame returning an empty list instead of a list of empty lists.
Other data frame libraries have similar behaviour: tibble does the same; data.table, Python's pandas and Rust's polars drop all the rows as soon as there are zero columns, because they don't preserve the row count via the row names.
---
I admit this is a case we rarely care about.However, for an example of this being an issue,?I've been running into it when treating data frames as database relations, where they have one or more candidate keys (irreducible subsets of the columns for which every row must have a unique value set).Sometimes, a generated relation can have an empty candidate key, which limits it to only having zero or one rows.Usually, I can check a relation contains no duplicated key values by using anyDuplicated:
df2 <- unique(ChickWeight[, c("Chick", "Diet")])keycols <- "Chick"?# Each chick only has one diet (Chick -> Diet)!anyDuplicated(df2[, keycols, drop = FALSE]) # TRUE, so Chick values are unique
When the key is empty, any row after the first must be a duplicate, but anyDuplicated doesn't detect these because of the above edge case, so I have to add special handling:
df3 <- data.frame(a = rep(1, 5)) # relations shouldn't have duplicate rowskeycols <- character(0) # a is constant, so key is empty!anyDuplicated(df3[, keycols, drop = FALSE]) # TRUE because equivalent to !any(logical(0)) by above, should be FALSE

Part of the problem is that it's not obvious what should be a
zero-column but non-zero-row data.frame mean.

On the one hand, your database relation use case is entirely valid. On
the other hand, if data.frames are considered to be tables of data with
row.names as their identifiers, then duplicated(d) should be returning
logical(nrow(d)) for zero-column data.frames, since row.names are
required to be unique. I'm sure that more interpretations can be
devised, requiring some other behaviour for duplicated() and friends.

Thankfully, duplicated() and anyDuplicated() are generic functions, and
you can subclass your data frames to change their behaviour:

duplicated.database_relation <- function(x, incomparables = FALSE, ...)
 if (length(x)) return(NextMethod()) else c(
  FALSE, rep(TRUE, nrow(x) - 1)
 )
.S3method('duplicated', 'database_relation')

anyDuplicated.database_relation <- function(
 x, incomparables = FALSE, ...
) if (nrow(x) > 1) 2 else 0
.S3method('anyDuplicated', 'database_relation')

x <- data.frame(row.names = 1:5)
class(x) <- c('database_relation', class(x))

duplicated(x)
# [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
anyDuplicated(x)
# [1] 2
unique(x)
# data frame with 0 columns and 1 row

Do you mean the row names should mean all the rows should be counted as non-duplicates?Yes, I can see the argument for that, thanks.I must say I'm still puzzled at what interpretation would motivate the current behaviour of returning a logical(0), however.

(I do not know how to make Outlook send plain text, so I avoid apostrophes.)

For what it is worth, I agree with Mark Webster. The discussion by Ivan Krylov is interesting, but if duplicated really treated a row name as part of the row then any(duplicated(data.frame(?))) would always be FALSE. My expectation is that if key1 is a subset of key2 then all(duplicated(df[key1]) >= duplicated(df[key2])) should always be TRUE.

Incidentally, the examples for duplicated and the documentation of unique hint that unique(x) is the same as (but more efficient than) x[!duplicated(x)] (for a vector) or x[!duplicated(x)],,drop=FALSE] (for a data frame), and this seems to be true even in the corner case (with what I consider incorrect output from both functions) . On the other hand, I do not see any explicit guarantee about the order of entries in unique(x) (or setdiff(?) or intersect(?)). Code using these functions could be more efficient with explicit guarantees, but maybe the core team wants to preserve its own flexibility. My suggestion is to include some options so users can at least lock in the current behaviour (with a note that future versions may achieve it less efficiently). Other options might include sort=TRUE in case the core team develops something more efficient than sort(unique(?)).

Regards,
Jorgen.

That's a good argument, thank you!

Would you suggest similar changes to duplicated.matrix too? Currently
it too returns 0-length output for 0-column inputs:

# 0-column matrix for 0-column input
str(duplicated(matrix(0, 5, 0)))
# logi[1:5, 0 ] 

# 1-column matrix for 1-column input
str(duplicated(matrix(0, 5, 1)))
# logi [1:5, 1] FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE

# a dim-1 array for >1-column input
str(duplicated(matrix(0, 5, 10)))
# logi [1:5(1d)] FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE

Subject: [R] Question regarding reservoir volume and water level
Message-ID: <CANTxAmJrvE5tHoyU1dgs0epeKrMv4tqg-R9K53CPA_TcR8sOvQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all;
I have a question about the water level of a reservoir, when the volume
changed or doubled.
There is a DEM file with the highest elevation 1267 m. The lowest elevation
is 1230 m. The current volume of the reservoir is 7,000,000 m3 at 1240 m.
Now I want to know what would be the water level if the volume rises to
1250 m? or what would be the water level if the volume doubled (14,000,000
m3)?

Is there any way to write codes to do this in R?
I would be more than happy if anyone could help me.
Sincerely

Hello,

This is a simple rule of three.
If you know the level l the argument doesn't need to be named but if you 
know the volume v then it must be named.


water_level <- function(l, v, level = 1240, volume = 7e6) {
   if(missing(v)) {
     volume * l / level
   } else level * v / volume
}

lev <- 1250
vol <- 14e6

water_level(l = lev)
#> [1] 7056452
water_level(v = vol)
#> [1] 2480

Aside from the fact that the original question might well be a class exercise (or homework), the question is unanswerable given the data given by the original poster. One needs to know the dimensions of the reservoir, above and below the current waterline. Are the sides, above and below the waterline smooth? Is the region currently above the waterline that can store water a mirror image of the region below the waterline? Is the region above the reservoir include a flood plane? Will the additional water go into the flood plane?

The lack of required detail in the question posed by the original poster suggests that there are strong assumptions, assumptions that typically would be made in a class-room example or exercise.

Chris, since it does indeed look like homework, albeit a deeper looks
suggests it may not beI think we can safely answer the question:

>Is there any way to write codes to do this in R?

The answer is YES.

And before you ask, it can be done in Python, Java, C++, Javascript, BASIC,
FORTRAN and probably even COBOL and many forms of assembler.

And, it can be done even without a computer using your mind and pencil and
paper.

I have seen similar problems discussed using a search and wonder if that is
where you should go, or perhaps consult your textbook or class notes.

OK, levity aside, what is the real question? 

If you want help designing an algorithm that solves the problem, that is
outside the scope of this forum and may indeed count as helping someone for
free with their homework or other work.

If this was a place for tutoring help you might  be asked to try to show
some work and point out where one step seems stuck. You might get answers.

Perhaps a better question is to look at your problem and see what it might
need and ask if someone knows of one or more R packages that handle your
needs.

But as I read your message, assume people reading it have no idea what a DEM
file is. I looked it up and it a Digital Elevation Model. I then searched to
see if anyone discussed how to bring the contents of the file into an R
session and found some suggestions but note I have not, nor plan, to try any
of them.

Your request does not specify any particular shape for the containment of
existing water or what is above. If it is from a DES file, it would have
info about what likely may be quite irregular surfaces that vary with depth.
That is not as simple a calculation as asking what happens if the container
is a cylinder or cone . It depends on the data we cannot see. It sounds way
beyond basic R as it likely involves working with 3-D matrices or something
similar.

So I looked for packages you can search for too and I see one called,
appropriately, DEM. I see other packages called Terra and CopernicusDEM  and
whitebox and you may want to do searching and see if anything solves parts
of your problem.

And, of course, it may be something you find will do it easily for you if
someone has provided say a module for Python.

Good Luck.

 With respect to duplicated.data.frame taking account of row names to return all the rows as unique: thinking about this some more, I can see that making sense in isolation, but it's at odds with the usual behaviour of duplicated for other classes, e.g. primitive vectors, where it doesn't take account of names.
> Would you suggest similar changes to duplicated.matrix too? Currently

duplicated.matrix is an interesting one. I think a similar change would make sense, because it would have the dimensions that people would expect when using the default MARGIN = 1. However, it could be argued that it's not a needed change, because the Value section of its documentation only guarantees the dimensions of the output when using MARGIN = 0. In that case, duplicated.matrix does indeed return the expected 5x0 matrix for your example:
str(duplicated(matrix(0, 5, 0), MARGIN = 0))# logi[1:5, 0 ]

John,

Your reaction was what my original reaction was until I realized I had to
find out what a DEM file was and that contains enough of the kind of
depth-dimension data you describe albeit what may be a very irregular cross
section to calculate for areas and thence volumes.

If I read it correctly, this can be a very real-world problem worthy of a
solution, such as in places like California where they had a tad more rain
than usual and some reservoirs may overflow. Someone else provided what
sounds like a mathematical algorithm but my guess is what is needed here is
perhaps less analytic since there may be no trivial way to create formulas
and take integrals and so on, but simply an approximate way to calculate
incremental volumes for each horizontal "slice" and keep adding or
subtracting them till you reach a target and then read off another variable
at that point such as depth.

Some care must be taken as water level has to be relative to something and
many natural reservoirs have no unique bottom level. Some water may also be
stored underground and to the side and pour in if the level lowers or can be
used to escape if the level rises.

Subject: Re: [R] Question regarding reservoir volume and water level

Aside from the fact that the original question might well be a class
exercise (or homework), the question is unanswerable given the data given by
the original poster. One needs to know the dimensions of the reservoir,
above and below the current waterline. Are the sides, above and below the
waterline smooth? Is the region currently above the waterline that can store
water a mirror image of the region below the waterline? Is the region above
the reservoir include a flood plane? Will the additional water go into the
flood plane?

The lack of required detail in the question posed by the original poster
suggests that there are strong assumptions, assumptions that typically would
be made in a class-room example or exercise.

Hello,

This is a simple rule of three.
If you know the level l the argument doesn't need to be named but if you
know the volume v then it must be named.


water_level <- function(l, v, level = 1240, volume = 7e6) {
   if(missing(v)) {
     volume * l / level
   } else level * v / volume
}

lev <- 1250
vol <- 14e6

water_level(l = lev)
#> [1] 7056452
water_level(v = vol)
#> [1] 2480


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas
