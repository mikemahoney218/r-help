Suppose that the predictors a, b, c, d, e, f are arranged in the
descending order of contribution to the model.

Consider a forward stepwise algorithm that is asked to choose three
variables.

It starts by testing a, b, c, d, e, f, and chooses a.

It continues by testing a + b, a + c, a + d, a + e, a + f, and chooses
a + b.

It continues by testing a + b + c, a + b + d, a + b + e, a + b + f, and
chooses a + b + c.

By being greedy, it doesn't consider, for example, the model d + e + f,
because for that it would have to pick d before a.

A greedy algorithm for K variables out N tests N + (N-1) + ... +
(N-K+1) = N*K - K(K-1)/2 models. An exhaustive search would have to test
choose(N,K) = N!/(N-K)!/K! models.

Subject: [R] R facets including two kinds of charts
Message-ID: <6b69af2baaeeaf7679053b7b9430ef08@philipsmith.ca>

I am asking for help with a ggplot2 program that has facets. There are 
actually 100 facets in my program, but in the example below I have 
limited the number to 3. There are two kinds of charts among the facets. 
One kind is a simple line plot with all of the y-values greater than 
zero. The facet for "A" in my example below is this kind. The other kind 
is a line plot combined with a bar chart with some of the y-values being 
positive and others negative. The facets for "B" and "C" in my example 
are this kind.

The facets for "B" and "C" look the way I want them to. However the 
facet for "A" has a scale on the y-axis that starts at zero, whereas I 
would like the minimum value on this scale to be non-zero, chosen by 
ggplot2 to be closer to the minimum value of y for that particular 
facet.

My example may not be the most efficient way to achieve this, but it 
works except for one aspect. Chart A, for which I do not wish to show a 
zero line, does indeed not show a zero line but it nevertheless chooses 
a scale for the y-axis that has a minimum value of zero. How can I 
adjust the code so that it chooses a minimum value on the y-axis that is 
non-zero and closer to the minimum actual y-value (as would be the case 
for a simple line chart alone, without any facets)?

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

df <- data.frame(
   date=c(1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6),
   
nm=c("A","B","C","A","B","C","A","B","C","A","B","C","A","B","C","A","B","C"),
   val0=c(NA,-5,4,NA,-3,3,NA,2,4,NA,3,3,NA,3,1,NA,-3,-4),
   val1=c(NA,-3,6,NA,-1,4,NA,5,5,NA,7,2,NA,4,3,NA,-2,-2),
   val2=c(50,NA,NA,53,NA,NA,62,NA,NA,56,NA,NA,54,NA,NA,61,NA,NA),
   zline=c(NA,0,0,NA,0,0,NA,0,0,NA,0,0,NA,0,0,NA,0,0)
)

ggplot(df)+
   geom_col(aes(x=date,y=val0),na.rm=TRUE,fill="white")+
   geom_line(aes(x=date,y=val1))+
   geom_line(aes(x=date,y=val2))+
   geom_hline(aes(yintercept=zline),na.rm=TRUE)+
   facet_wrap(~nm,scales="free_y")

Thank you for your assistance.

Philip

Hello,

Try to remove

scales="free_y"

from facet_wrap(). With scales="free_y" each facet will have its own y 
limits, given by the data plotted in each of them. If you want a global 
y limits, don't use it.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Thanks for the suggestion, but this does not give me what I want. Each 
chart needs its own unique scale on the y-axis.

Hello,

I hadn't understood the problem, sorry.
The problem are the bar plots, ggplot is plotting one in the "A" facet. 
And since there is nothing to plot, the bars start at 0.

A hack is to plot facet "A" separately and then combine the plots with 
one of several ways to combine ggplot plots. Below is an example with 
cowplot::plot_grid


library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(cowplot)

p1 <- df %>%
   filter(nm == "A") %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = date)) +
   geom_line(aes(y = val2)) +
   facet_wrap(~ nm, scales = "free_y") +
   theme(plot.margin = unit(c(0.2, 0, 0.1, 0), "cm"))

p2 <- df %>%
   filter(nm != "A") %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = date)) +
   geom_col(aes(y = val0), na.rm = TRUE, fill = "white") +
   geom_line(aes(y = val1)) +
   ylab("") +
   facet_wrap(~ nm, scales = "free_y")

plot_grid(p1, p2, rel_widths = c(1, 2))


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Thank you. That approach could work and I might use it, but a 
complication is that the 100 facets must be in a specified order and 
that order mixes charts of type A and B/C in an unsystematic way. I 
suppose I could write two functions, use them to create all the plots 
and then join them together with cowplot. Or perhaps I could use 
patchwork, with which I am more familiar. I was of course hoping this 
could just be done with facets.

Incidentally this used to work fine with facets (I post the results on 
the web periodically. See 
http://www.philipsmith.ca/Canadian_macroeconomic_indicators/) but 
something must have changed in one of the packages (I'm guessing) and 
that approach suddenly stopped working.

Subject: [R] grep

Good Morning. Below I like statement like

j<-grep(".r\\b",colnames(mydata),value=TRUE); j

with the \\b option which I read long time ago which Ive found useful.

Are there more or these options, other than ? grep? Thanks.

dstat is just my own descriptive routine.

You can find more by reading through ?regex as well as Perl documentation
(which you can find online).

Hello,

The metacharacters reference is the documentation ?regex.
If you want to know whether there are more metacharacters similar to \b,
there are \< and \>. low are examples of using them instead of \b.

Also, the pattern '.r' does not match a period followed by an 'r', the 
period matches any character ('.'). To match a literal period you must 
escape it. The correct regex is '\\.r'.



x <- c("age", "sleep", "primary", "middle", "high", "somewhath", "veryh",
        "somewhatm", "verym", "somewhatc", "veryc", "somewhatl", "veryl",
        "village", "married", "social", "agricultural", "communist",
        "minority", "religious")
colnms <- c("depression", "sleep", "female", "village", "agricultural",
             "married", "communist", "minority", "religious", "social", 
"no",
             "primary", "middle", "high", "veryh", "somewhath", "notveryh",
             "verym", "somewhatm", "notverym", "veryc", "somewhatc", 
"notveryc",
             "veryl", "somewhatl", "notveryl", "age", "village.r", 
"married.r",
             "social.r", "agricultural.r", "communist.r", "minority.r", 
"religious.r",
             "male.r", "education.r")

grep("\\.r\\b", colnms, value = TRUE)
#> [1] "village.r"      "married.r"      "social.r"       "agricultural.r"
#> [5] "communist.r"    "minority.r"     "religious.r"    "male.r"
#> [9] "education.r"
# the same as above
# \\> matches the empty string at the end of a word,
# \\b matches the empty string at both ends of a word
grep("\\.r\\>", colnms, value = TRUE)
#> [1] "village.r"      "married.r"      "social.r"       "agricultural.r"
#> [5] "communist.r"    "minority.r"     "religious.r"    "male.r"
#> [9] "education.r"

# 4 col names have a 'm' and end in '.r' therefore 4 matches
grep("m.*\\.r\\>", colnms, value = TRUE)
#> [1] "married.r"   "communist.r" "minority.r"  "male.r"
# only the strings starting with 'm'
grep("\\bm.*\\.r\\b", colnms, value = TRUE)
#> [1] "married.r"  "minority.r" "male.r"
grep("\\<m.*\\.r\\>", colnms, value = TRUE)
#> [1] "married.r"  "minority.r" "male.r"


Hope this helps,
