Subject: [R] help files for libraries that aren't in the defaults library tree
Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.3.91.981201074948.10784A-100000@oriole.er.usgs.gov>

Hello,

I created a library for a bunch of functions that I use frequently
so that I dont have to carry duplicate copies around to wherever I fire
up an R sesssion.  However, I have problems locating the help files
for those functions.  Here are some details.

I created the library "myR" and installed this in /home/royle/R
using:

R INSTALL -l /home/royle/R /home/royle/Rpackages/myR

This went well, and I can access all of those functions in the
usual way....i.e. like:

 library(myR,lib.loc="/home/royle/R/")


But, I found that to get the help files I have to type:

 help(interp,lib.loc="/home/royle/R/")

and so it is kind of a pain to have to specify the lib.loc argument
every time I want to see a help file (not like I need to see the
help files because I wrote the functions, but I can imagine this
to be a pain for anyone who installs a package into a library tree
other than the defaults).

In any case, I went on an installed the library in $RHOME/library
and everything seems to work out ok.  But, I think that generally
one would need root access to install to RHOME/library and so folks
might be inclined to install elsewhere.

The question: is there a way to make these help files accessible 
when installed in a something other than the default library tree 
_without_ using the lib.loc option in help? 

Possible solution: It seems to me that I could add my new library tree 
to .lib.loc but wouldn't I have to create a new .lib.loc in every R session?


Thanks in advance for assistance.

The online help [?.lib.loc  or ?library ..]
gives the solution:

So,

1) in a  [t]csh environment, you'd write in your  ~/.login

	setenv RLIBS /home/royle/R

2) in  [ba|k]sh	environment, you'd have in your ~/.profile

	RLIBS=/home/royle/R  export RLIBS

Sorry to all bothering you with a trivial question:
I am using R (rw0630 for Win32) and am simply unable to read-in the *.txt data. 
I've tried to copy the file (prum.txt) to different directories of rw0630 but get 
uniformly the answer "object "prum.txt" not found". Which is the default 
directory for read.table() ??
Thanks!

Also, as a general Unix security note, you wouldn't need to be root to
write to the R library tree. A safer alternative is to make that directory
owned by a special user or group, so that selected people can be given the
power to install R libraries but not necessarily to destroy the entire
file system.

  read.table("c:\\Fryderyk\\Chopin\\prum.txt") #full path,
                                               #note the double slash
  or
  read.table("c:/Fryderyk/Chopin/prum.txt") #full path, Unix like name
  
  You can also give path relative to the current directory
  which is set by Windows using its convention, not by R,i.e.,
  1) if you launch R from a Windows command console
     c:\Amadeus\Mozart> ....rw06330\bin\R.exe <ret>
     you can use something like
     read.table("../../Fryderyk/Chopin/prum.txt")
     since "current directory"=c:\Amadeus\Mozart
  2) if you launch Rusing a short-cut "current directory"=../rw0630/bin
     or what you set in the property panel of the short-cut.

Hello:

  I modified benchmark used in
http://www.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/~stst/benchspl.txt now the attached
code will work with R, except for last test for some reason (Sorry ran out
of time to play with this).
  Immediate problem is that R does not show fraction of seconds. So, that
kinda makes comparison some what hard. I also looked at memory and CPU usage
on NT console. R seems to go into hybernation when not focused. The results
are mixed. I am sure if I add something complicated or/and loops that Splus
will slow down to crawl.
  Another interesting thing is that the random generator on Splus is a
rocket.
  I had many things running on the computer while trying to do this, so I am
very confident about results.
  Has anyone done something similar? If so let me know.

You need to put the name of the file in quotes, i.e.
R> read.table("prum.txt")

If the argument is not in quotes then read.table expects the argument to
be an R "object". In this case, the object would be a string containing
the name of the file, so

R> myfile <- "prum.txt"
R> read.table(myfile)

would work too.

It is the working directory of R (normally the bin directory in the R
home tree, but you can change this by creating a shortcut and changing
the "Start in" field in the properties dialogue).

In R, you can only dyn.load dll files, not obj files.  In addition they
have to be built with the Mingw32 compiler (either directly on a Win9*
system, or cross-compiled from a unix system).  Even then, there is a
bug in Win9* built dll's which may prevent dynamic loading (cross-
compiled OK).  See Guido's help file for more information on building
dll's.

Perhaps you are confusing R with S+ where an obj file can be dynamically
loaded with dyn.load, provided the obj file was created with the Watcom
10.* compiler.

Did he design it for use with R on a Windows system ?  What compiler did
he use ?

You really do need to say that you did this on Wintel, and give versions of
the packages you used.  As R does not have a BATCH mode that runs on NT
AFAIK, I assume you source-ed the code, which is not a good idea and can be
most misleading due to different memory usage from typing at the command
line.  In short, with benchmarks the details do matter greatly.

No, it isn't!  As RNGs go it is quite slow, but the R one is very slow
(despite the title of the paper `efficient' for which they  never gave any 
evidence).  Lots of timings in a paper of mine written a decade ago:

Ripley, B. D. (1990) Thoughts on pseudorandom number generators. J. Comput.
Appl. Math. 31, 153-163. 

Not that in many real tasks you will notice the difference: there are some
but I would not do those in R.

These sort of tests do not test the language nor typical uses of it.
They test a few of the built-in routines, thereby mainly testing the
compilers used but also the accuracy/speed compromises used. Thus for
example for an eigendecomposition I do want to know not only the speed but
also the accuracy.

I have run fairly extensive tests of real code (from V&R, for example),
mainly to find problems.  I won't give you extensive sets of numbers, but
re-iterate what I said recently on R-devel: the times are almost always
within a factor of two, and on Solaris S-PLUS 3.4 is usually a little
faster than R 0.63.0. (I am not going to comment on something as
experimental as R on Windows as although I do now have a batch mode running
reliably on Win9x, this is very recent.)

Note that, having tried it, I do NOT believe `if I add something
complicated or/and loops that Splus will slow down to crawl'. Your
prejudices are showing!

Subject: [R] benchmarks 
Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.3.91.981202081710.14492J-100000@oriole.er.usgs.gov>

While we're on the subject, I ran a few tests on several of our platforms 
here and although I don't claim that these are very sophisticated 
(or even general), I did find some results that were interesting to me 
(in determining my computing platform).  This is my summary:

(1) Matrix operation benchmark on a Sun Sparc 20:

     R : 69 seconds 
     S+: 43 seconds

(2) Looping benchmark doing lots of flops (same machine):

     R : 6 seconds  
     S+: 24 seconds

(3) Matrix operation benchmark on Pentium II - 400 running NT:

     R : 30 seconds
 
(4) Matrix operation benchmark on Pentium II - 400 running Linux:

     R : 11 seconds

I can't afford Splus on my PC so I can only compare R across OS's ,
but that was sufficiently useful for my purposes.  I found it interesting
that the performance was so different between NT and Linux, but I suspect
it has something to do with the preferred development platform.

The matrix operation benchmark basically involved generating 
a huge matrix of random numbers, doing  X'X and inverting that,
(and maybe something else, I forget).  The looping benchmark
did a small number of muliplications 10000 times or something.

I also did an I/O benchmark where S+ was 20 or 30% faster by
my recollection, but I think this was flawed.

Subject: [R] Benchmark
Message-ID: <A1AFC4253BA3D111BFF70001FA7E9AAC4DDBAE@EWFD19>

Prof,

  The reason I rewrote the code was to compare it to work already done by
Stefan. 
  You are right, given that 0.63.0 NT version of R's status and many things
I have running. The results should NOT be taken literally (I think I missed
NOT part in the earlier letter) and interpreted with much caution.
  It also happens that no one can agree on any benchmark. This code just
happened to be around and much work has been done already. I have seen many
benchmark studies. I still have not seen one that people could agree on. Not
to start a flame war, but MS claims that VB is as fast as C++. Inprise
claims that Delphi is faster than VB. Java camp claims 1/2 the speed of C++,
when compiled native. VB claims that Java is slower by factor of teens. 
  Everyone has a benchmark to prove their point. Virtually any benchmark can
be stacked for one lang or another. I can show that Numeric Python is fast
as C, while Perl can show that it can cut files less than 1/2 the speed on
Python by using some tricks.
  Only thing that really matters is a "how fast would my application run."
Well, we can NOT write same application over and over again in every
possible lang choices. We have to take some sample measures with "Grain of
salt."

  I will probably say that "look at ANY benchmark with great skeptism."
Still, they can be useful in some narrow contexts.  

  The reason I provided full source is so any one can try this and modify it
without doing this work over again. Especially with my machine running 10
things at once. I would expect others to try it on their machine and
different platforms.
  Given that I have been using R for less than a week, I needed some guiding
post and wanted to share what I had.

>From http://www.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/~stst/ncrunch.html#Speed
7. Speed comparison
The following speed comparison have been performed on a PENTIUM PC with 90
MHz and 96 MB RAM running under
Windows NT 4.0 with Windows versions of the programs (all timings are
displayed in seconds)
                                                  Gauss    Mac-syma Maple
Mathmatica Matlab MuPad OMtrx  Ox     Splus
400 x 400 random matrix^1000     16.476     136.747     > 1h      30.023
5.468  > 1h     0.400  1.011   1.260

On NT machines Splus ranks as close third and much faster than R for
generating Random Matrix. Comparatively speaking, it seems a Rocket compared
to many that takes over an hour and even compared to Gauss (which I have
been using for last 5 years).


	>Note that, having tried it, I do NOT believe `if I add something
	>complicated or/and loops that Splus will slow down to crawl'. Your
	>prejudices are showing!

I think no one will doubt that Splus is about the one of the worst languages
to do loops in. Back in Salomon Bros (before "Citi Traveling Barney
Brothers"), we used to joke about S in Splus really stands for Slow.
Everytime I have to anything remotely like a loop, I just abandoned Splus.
The reason I said that R might be faster on loops is the impression I gained
from various sources including CRAN and this e-mail list. Why just other
day:

>Problems which require lots of looping and cannot be re-coded as
vector/matrix
>operations are theoretically possible but practically infeasible in S,
unless
>they  are coded in C or Fortran and called from S. These problems seem to
run fine in R.
>
>Paul Gilbert

I really hope that Paul is right about this. I guess this was more a case of
"wishful thinking" than "prejudices." Acually, given that my speed results
seemed quite close to each other, I wanted to make sure that others know
that I am not contradicting what they have already stated.

I would like to see other people run this test on their machines and report
back. I also would like to see additional tests and make a better comparison
possible. Although I do not think there is real test that can be performed
that shows absolute advantage, we can look at the test and pick out the most
important feature for our particular need.

BTW: Given the nature of the trading floor, sometimes I have to write these
letters very quickly. Many times, errors will be creeping in (like not
adding NOT to: "I had many things running on the computer while trying to do
this, so I am ^^^
very confident about results" on earlier letter). My apologies in advance.

Yes. This is not true for S-PLUS (see the V&R2 programming complements)
and the same reasoning applies to R. You can build DLLs on other
compilers, but then don't expect to be able to call system routines.

BTW: Douglas Steele's caveat on DLLs is out of date: we do know how
to build them natively on Windows in a way that works on all Windows
platforms. Look back in instructions in the V&R2 `R complements' for
details. (www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/MASS2/sites.html)

Well, yes, obviously, but there is no problem _here_. You should get

> print.default
function (x, digits = NULL, quote = TRUE, na.print = NULL, print.gap =
NULL, 
    right = FALSE, ...) 
.Internal(print.default(x, digits, quote, na.print, print.gap, 
    right))

and I expect the final argument is missing. It isn't when I unpack a fresh
copy here, so I can only assume you have used my base5.zip that does
not apply to that version but to rw0630, or otherwise have some 0.63.0
things around.

Please don't use R-help for messages about development versions. I have
only put that version up to allow batch mode to be tested. Treat it like
anything else based on an R snapshot, as potentially suspect, and contact
the author or R-devel.

Actually, I said that the restriction on the Watcom compiler requirement
for S+ ONLY related to loading OBJ files.  Any compiler able to make a
32bit DLL could be used to create a loadable dll file for S+.  With S+
if one links to a copy of the system import lib, then system commands
can be called.

The most recent information I know on this is Guido's approach...

  "So, as Mumit said we need a binutils for Win32 
   which does not use the Windows crtdll.dll. One
   possibility is to use the cygnus binutils which 
   use the cygnus C library. So, I made the following two
   attempt:
   A) I replaced the egcs-1.1. binutils with the one from
   Cygnus B20 (only the binutils not the compiler); 
   recompiled rw0624 and its dll's;
   B) same but using gccwin32 (not egcs1.1).
   I tested the dll's so built on:
   a)Win98+rw0624;
   b) win95+rw0624;
   c)Win95+rw0623
   without problems."


And I tested Guido's dll's on my system (Win95b) which could not load
Win95 natively built dll's  (that is built in SOME Win95 systems,
including mine).  Guido's dll worked OK.  However, his always did on my
system; some Win95 built dll's seemed OK on my system.

The only real test is to make the dll on a Win95 machine, using Guido's
approach, which up until that time had produced dll's which refused to
load.  I would be interested to hear if this specific test has been
done.  (I would have, but now use S+/Watcom/f2c and no longer have
enough space available).

If there have been further developments since then I would of course be
interested.

  Douglas,
  dll's made natively using the linker of the Cygnus B20 seems
  to work well everywhere. 
  Brian Ripley (look to the Instructions in his makehelp.zip 
  file, or to the V&R R complement) has detailed what must be
  done.
  And thanks again for all your testing.

Hello,

This is perhaps a little off-topic, but I am curious as to what compilers
people use to compile R (under unix/linux).  I am primarily interested in
the use of egcs or gcc, g77 or f2c, etc.  It seems most of the gcc
interest and development is towards egcs, and while a gcc 2.8.1/g77
combination did work and compile R on my primary linux machine, it also
managed to produce kernels that did not allow me to run X.  I have
reinstalled 2.7.2.1 (?? it's a machine at home) and have re-made my
kernels, but I'm a little baffled as to what to do next.  I admit my gcc
2.8.1/g77 installation was a bit odd but before I try and redo things I
thought I'd find out what everyone else is using.

egcs 1.1 seems to work ok, egcs 1.0.2 does not (generates wrong code
with -O2).

Subject: [R] image ()
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.96.981203140843.660A-100000@iamgygax.unizh.ch>

Dear all,

I am working with R Version 0.62.2  (July 10, 1998) on a SuSE Linux 5.2.

I have troubles in understanding the function image (). Can someone
enlighten me?

I'd like to draw a square image-plot (with every little part of the image
a square as well) and add some (straight) lines to it. Also, I create an
empty z matrix which I need to fill step by step. Thus I tried to find out
how exactly the image squares are fitted into the x-y axis. 

(in S-plus, one way to do it is to have x and y one integer bigger than
the dimensions of the z matrix. Thus x and y give the corner coordinates
of the little image squares. Or, x and y are the same length as the
dimensions of the z-matrix and then x and y give the center of the image
squares.) 

Now I don't really see how it is done in R from the help file thus I did a
simple example:

> test.mat <- matrix (1:9, ncol= 3)
> image (1:3, 1:3, test.matrix)
> iamge (1:4, 1:4, test.matrix)

both commands are executed without error.

BUT the first one splits the two axis at 1.5 and 2.5 (starting at 1 and
ending at 3) and thus not all the little image squares (or rather
rectangles) are the same size.

In the second case, again the image rectangles at the edge are smaller
than in the center and part of the plot stays empty as there are 16 fields
but only 9 values in the matrix (no complaint that the axes and the
dimensions of the matrix don't match).

If I leave out the x and y (as suggested in the help file) the image looks
the same as with 1:3, the only difference being that the scale runs from 0
to 1 (with splits at 0.25 and 0.75). 

Can I influence this behaviour and how?

Thank you for your help! Regards,

Message-ID: <A1AFC4253BA3D111BFF70001FA7E9AAC4DDBBC@EWFD19>

http://www.troll.no/announce/tmake-12.html

Hi,

  Givn all this talk about compilers and dyn.load, I just wanted to point
out the above address. The tmake does following: (from the website)

tmake is an easy-to-use tool for creating and maintaining makefiles across
many platforms and compilers. The idea is that you should spend your time
writing code, not makefiles. The tmake project was started around mid 1996
and has become a popular tool for creating makefiles. tmake can also
generate Microsoft Visual Studio project (.dsp) files, something which
facilitates efficient use of Visual Studio in the development of Qt
programs. 
tmake was originally written for creating Qt-based programs, but can also be
employed for other types of projects: 
     C and C++ programs and libraries 
     Qt programs 
     OpenGL programs 
     X11 programs 
     Unix shared objects 
     Windows applications 
     Windows DLLs (e.g. Netscape Plugins) 
     Shared and static libraries 
     Custom makefiles (requires some knowledge of Perl) 
tmake is based on interpreting makefile templates containing Perl code and
is therefore very customizable. 
Supported platforms: AIX, Data General, FreeBSD, HPUX, SGI Irix, Linux,
NetBSD, OpenBSD, OSF1/DEC, SCO, Solaris, SunOS, Ultrix, Unixware and Win32. 
-------------------------------
  Given how many different platform R supports, I think this would be nice
to use. I frankly would love to just use VC++ rather than other compilers on
NT (possible conflict with VC++ with Cygnus when I type make on the
prompt). Some of you might know about tmake, but I thought others might not.
It uses Perl (yuk), but I heard pretty good things about it from Python
people too.
  I just decided to sneak this in while things are still little off-topic.

BTW: I am not a MS fan, but my Sys Admin told me that I am on my own if I
use something else besides VC++. I "love" to keep on getting support.

I had this same question about two days ago and I think I concluded
that the [1,1] element of the matrix is the upper left corner of
the image plot, which is the (1,n) coordinate in the plot space.
The [n,1] element of the matrix is the (1,1) coordinate in the plot
space, the [1,n] element is the (n,n) coordinate and the 
[n,n] element is the (n,1) coordinate.  
This actually makes sense if the grid coordinates are indexed like:
 
1  5  9  13
2  6  10 14
3  7  11 15
4  8  12 16

which is pretty standard (then points in the data matrix
correspond to the matrix that indexes grid points...or the
ith element of the vec of the data matrix corresponds to the
ith grid point), then the pixels in the image that you view 
are arranged like the grid points. Also, this indexing of
grid points  is convenient for locating the neighbors of any point.

In any case, I had a question about putting a legend on an
image plot.  Can someone give me advice on that?  I was hoping
that a canned legend function exists for image, but it doesn't
appear so.

One other question: Contour does not appear to label contour lines.
Was this a neglected detail, or a feature?

regards,
andy

I have a paid ``volunteer'' who started work yesterday.  His job will
include upgrading contour, image, persp etc.  In addition I hope that
he will also add some mapping facilities along the lines of GMT (using
their shoreline database).

Now would be a good time to make suggestions about desirable features.

Subject: [R] Rweb ... Using R over the Web
Message-ID: <l03130301b28c8607409f@[207.0.103.166]>

Over the past year I have been working on a Web interface to R, Rweb.
Anyone that is interested in trying it out can point their browser at:

	http://www.math.montana.edu/Rweb

The main Rweb page provides access to three versions of Rweb. A simple text
entry form that returns output and graphs, a more sophisticated Javascript
version that provides a multiple window environment, and a set of point and
click modules that are useful for introductory statistics courses and
require no knowledge of the R language. All of the Rweb versions can
analyze Web accessible datasets if a URL is provided.

A paper on Rweb will (hopefully) appear soon in the Journal of Statistical
Software (http://www.stat.ucla.edu/journals/jss/). The paper provides a
detailed explanation of the different versions of Rweb and an overview of
how Rweb works.

All of the source code for Rweb (mostly Perl scripts) is available at:

	http://www.math.montana.edu/Rweb/Resources.html

We have used Rweb in most of our introductory statistics courses, and a few
advanced courses, with great success. It has significantly reduced the
problems we used to have in the computer labs.

Any comments, suggestions, questions, or criticisms are welcome.

OK this may be a long shot.
I often have to make a plot of like this: the heights (z) of trees in a
forest (whose locations are unif rand x,y) are recorded. Now we make a 3D
shaded surface plot of the (x,y,z) data. A triangular mesh is made by
finding the Delaunay triangulation (nearest neighbours are connected).

I am not talking about doing some form of interpolation (hence forcing the
data onto a regular grid).

Right now I make this type of plot with Mathematica, but it would be nice
to do this in R and get rid of Mma.

Thanks very much Ross for getting the persp() function into R.

  - ability to save and re-plot contours (e.g., for doing contours with
annotation, or selecting different pieces of a contour "object")

  - a good way to save the state of the last perspective used (in S-PLUS
3.3 and earlier you have to keep a "perspective" object around and pass it
with every call

  - flexible ways of specifying 3-D objects to add to a perspective plot,
grids for back and sides of plot space, etc.

  I always found the S-PLUS 3-D plotting routines klugey and fragile (for
example, you had to play around a lot with margins a lot in non-obvious
ways just to get things to show up on the plot) and it would/will be
lovely to have open, robust 3-D plotting primitives.

  thanks,

I assume that means S 3-D plotting routines: the last five years have
brought Trellis and Axum versions to S-PLUS. Interactive rotation of
perspective plots would be a great boon, as would shading options for
perspective plots, including contouring on such plots.

I am envisioning a division into static and dynamic plots.  The static
version will concentrate on rendering as nice a picture as possible -
anti-aliasing (if supported) arbitrary text rotation etc, whereas the
dynamic version will shoot for speed.  It would be possible to use
direct manipulation in a dynamic plot of a wire-frame to select a
viewing direction and then have a nicely rendered version of the
surface produced in a separate (static) plot.

This separation is motivated by the fact that there will soon be some
rather nice rendering tools available for Unix/Linux (anti-aliasing
built-in), but their performance will be limited.  One day we will all
have OpenGL hardware acceleration and then we can have just one
graphics system (maybe).

Shading is possible with the current version of "persp", but you
have to compute the shades yourself :-(.  An automated version of this
is on my list, as is contouring on (and under) the rendered surface
and draping.

Of course, as always, limited resources may well curtail what we can
produce.  I giving fairly high priority to being able to draw maps, as
that is something I personally will need for teaching.

I have a slightly off-topic question, but I think I got it
originally from this list:

I am looking for an article (probably to some mailing-list)
titled "A Statistical Scandal" (I think), which I once have
seen, but now cannot find. It was about how bad some 
statistical packages handles certain tasks. I also remember
the phrase "four-letter acronym" regarding the name of
one such package.

Can anyone help me finding this article? Thanks!

It was on Allstat (find the online archive with yor favourite search

Rather than adding every capability known to science, improved interfaces
between R and other programs (e.g., GMT), would be a better investment
of resources.

Commercial packages (S-plus, Matlab) end up trying to incorporate every
application for which there is a market, and have no great incentive to
make it easier for people to work with external applications.

In contrast, free packages should strive to support flexible interfaces
between applications, although getting that to work smoothly outside unix
may not be feasible.

This principle is demonstrated by contrasting octave with matlab. Octave
provides a pipe routine and (as a script, popen2).  Although matlab and
octave support essentially the same interface for binary I/O on files,
octave has a few extras (popen, waitpid) that make all the difference. If
you want to pass data thru an external program in Matlab most people will
end up writing temporary files rather than fuss with named pipes.  One
technical issue that limits the utility of pipes outside unix is the
problem of DOS/Win/OS2 "text" mode.

My work involves remote sensing images where files are large enough that
I/O time is an issue and one must be careful about allocating space for
temporary files.  Octave makes a very useful "glue" tool for this work. In
R it appears to be necessary to do the I/O via temporary files, which is
inefficient and, for very large data sets, impractical.  Indeed, I often
use octave to format data from several binary files into temporary ASCII
files suitable for use with R's read.table, but R would be much more
useful if I could read directly from (multiple, binary, assorted format)
files.

It is certainly possible to add binary I/O capabilities to R via a
(binio?) library, although not a trivial project to support all the
data types and big/little endian conversions.  R and octave share 
similar limitations on the internal data types, so you would often
be reading, say "unsigned char" data into double precision arrays.

In practice, a binio library would probably need file handles so that
you can open a file and read or write arbitrary locations using arbitrary
data conversions.  Changes to current file I/O functions might be
useful, e.g., so read.table could be connected to the output of a
filter called via "popen2".

Returning to Bill's problem, many GMT routines can read from stdin and
will issue messages to stderr or stdout.  Most people write shell scripts
to run the series of GMT commands (programs) needed to perform an analysis
or generate a plot.  Such scripts often use awk or perl to perform some of
the calculations.  Currently, one could use R to save data to an ASCII
file and then run such scripts using "system".  For many problems,
however, translating the shell script to a series of popen2() commands
with data piped directly from R to a GMT program would save considerable
system resources and allow the use of R's computational capabilities.

Subject: [R] R-0.63.1 is released
Message-ID: <x21zmgoulc.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


I've put up R-0.63.1.tgz up for FTP from Auckland some minutes ago.
As usual, don't get it from there unless you are desperate, but wait
for it to be mirrored at a CRAN site near you within a day or two.

For those who *are* desperate, I've left a copy in
	ftp://blueberry.kubism.ku.dk/pub/R-devel/R-0.63.1.tgz 
(Be gentle, that's my desktop PC!)

The person who fetched R-0.63 *from New Zealand* last time might
prefer ftp.stat.auckland.ac.nz, though...

There's also a version split in two for floppies and a patch file if
you prefer that.

Here is the relevant part of the NEWS file:

		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.63.1

NEW FEATURES

    o   new function mosaicplot().

    o	xy.coords(.) has a  "recycle = FALSE" argument,	 used in text().

    o	RNGtype() allows to choose different Random Number Generators.
		__EXPERIMENTAL__

    o	print.default(.) now also works with a `right = TRUE' argument.
	{{ print.matrix(.) is bound to become deprecated... }}

    o	new help page `Memory' on the usage of command line options
	--vsize and --nsize. Error message if R runs out of memory
	points to help(Memory).

    o	rowsum() and improved na.omit() added from survival4
    
    o	backsolve(.) has new arguments "upper.tri = TRUE,  transpose = FALSE"

    o	hist() has new "right = TRUE" argument;	 
	"right = FALSE" gives  [a,b) intervals

    o	help() has "htmlhelp" argument, allowing to suppress htmlhelp after
	help.start().  This is desired for ESS.

    o   quantile(.) has an "names = TRUE" argument for speed.
	It is much better documented now.


BUG FIXES

    o	build-help --dosnames should now also work for text help,
	latex and examples.

    o	seq() should work better now (fuzz-factor 1e-7 inserted)

    o	multiple arguments to return caused value to be a pairlist

    o	data.frame choked on long names from deparse()

    o	data.edit now works (dataedit doesn't need pairlist()s anymore)

    o	as.pairlist(NULL) is ok

    o	ts(1:5, start=2, end=4) now work.  Further plot(ts(..), ts(..))

    o	eigen() returns $vectors in any case [S compat].

    o	apply(cbind(1,1:9, 2, quantile) doesn't drop quantile names anymore

    o	array(1, dim=(1:3)[c(F,F,F)]) is now valid == array(1,NULL) == c(1);
	the same for array(a,d, list())

    o	fix problem with step() and offsets

    o	drop attributes on matrix subsetting

    o	kappa(.) now works [dtrco now in load table (ROUTINES)].

    o	pmin() and pmax() now preserve attributes.

    o	handle null models arising in drop1(), step, etc.

    o	partial matching problem with $ indexing

    o	matplot(.) works with lwd (vectors)

    o	par("cex.axis") now has the desired effect...

    o	which(.) now omits NAs in its argument.

    o	rbind.data.frame caused character-to-factor coercion a bit too often

    o	couple of messups in dotplot

    o	z[[1]] <- ~x probl fixed as suggested by J.Lindsey 

    o   do_modelframe could lose contrast attributes

    o	"make check" needed standardisation of locale

    o	unlist(...,recursive=F) got names wrong

It is an e-mail from John Nelder.  I saw this on the "allstat"
mailing list, although of course it may be available elsewhere.
It is archived at

There is GPLed Delaunay triangulation code in Java (including a fast
approximate algorithm) as part of Visad
(http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/visad.html). There is an old C
implementation which may well have the same algorithms.

There is Delaunay code in the R package tripack, and, implicitly, in
package akima which may well be helpful: if I understand Bill
correctly he wants to put a plane on each triangle to get a surface (which
is interpolation) and Akima was more sophisticated and used quintics
to achieve a smooth interpolated surface. We may be missing the crux
here: was it to have a means of displaying such surfaces?

Yes, bang on. I knew of the existence of the Delaunay code in the R
libraries. Yes I want to make a picture that places a planar facet on each
triangle. The resulting surface looks like the surface of a cut diamond
for example (assuming the cuts give triangular facets). So far as I know
there is no way to display such a 3D plot in R. persp uses rectangular
rather than triangular mesh.

>From the description of the akima package, it sounded like it just did
some of the work required PRIOR to making the 3D plot. But that is useless
if I can't make the plot.

I think of it as the 3D version of the 2D  
connect-the-dots-with-line-segments plot. Now the points are connected by
planes rather than lines.

This is a pretty crucial point.  The technology in R (and S and Octave
for that matter) is OLD, and is not well suited to what you propose.
However, I think that a number of new things are coming along which
will help.

The first of these is CORBA which allows very general communication
between computational processes, the other is Java.  I'm not really a
Java fan, but I don't think that it can be ignored - it just has too
much momentum.

A number of us (including the current S authors) have been having
discussions about how we can use this new technology. I would expect
that the next couple of years will begin to see a new generation
software begin to emerge.  And yes, it will be open software, although
with a BSD style licence rather than GPL.

I guess I have a couple of problems with GMT.  1) It is postcript only
and 2) it is pretty rigid.  But the authors have done an enormous
service in making their GSHHS database available.  All I'm really
proposing is to provide a simple R interface to that.

For binary data, the latest R has an interface to the HDF (version 5)
library (provided by Marcus Daniels).  This moves in the direction
of providing a standard means for binary data exchange.

Once the trianglation was produced it would be just a minor change in
the present "persp" function to plot it.  The algorithm I use is to
sort the facets by depth and then to plot them, back to front.  This
works just as well for triangular facets as rectangular ones.

If you'd care to define some data structures (or better yet a class)
which will hold a desciption of the triangulation, I can have my student
tweak the present code to display the structure.

Sorry to be such an idiot but I'm afraid that's beyond me.
Should I try to figure out the output of akima, then tell you what I find
out? I imagine that would be the input to the triangle version of persp.

Thanks very much Ross.

We have a interface which provides a generic way for applications to read and
write objects to a database. (This is not a query interface.) I use it for
transferring time series data between S/R and Fame, but there is nothing which
makes it especially specific to S or R or Fame. The protocol is not specific to
time series, but the data format we use is. It handles endian problems and uses
RPC so it works over the Internet. It communicates directly and does not write
intermediate files. I work in Unix but a commercial vendor has  implemented a
Windows version and also a version for Matlab. (I have not used these.) There
should be no cross-platform problem. Details and the code are available at
<http://www.bank-banque-canada.ca/pgilbert>. (I have a version of the code which
works with R but it is not on the web site yet. If you want that please contact
me.)

There appears to be some overlap between what we have done and HDF or NetCDF but
I am not too familiar with these. (If someone knowledgeable would be prepared to
brief me I would appreciate that.)

I expect someday CORBA will be the way to go. There is an ongoing effort to by
an OMG "Special Interest Group/ Domain Task Force" to define statistical objects
and they currently have an RFP/RFI for which I believe they are hoping to have
reponses by Dec. 19. (A few more details are attached below. I can provide more
information if anyone is interested, please email me directly rather than
through the list.) I believe this is being co-ordinated with the UN/EDIFACT
"generalized statistical message" (GESMES) effort.

I have updated my package of R-0.63.1 to the released version and added the

http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/R/win32/new/bdr0631.zip

There are only a few other changes (timings to 0.01 sec, for one).  Still
view this as experimental, although it works well for me on Win95.
All the code you need to build libraries is there (but not the tools).

Subject: [R] FREE DEMO of Web Promotion Software That Submits Your Site to 1100+ 
         Search Engines!
Message-ID: <btcjkdgp>

Greetings!

I thought I would take some time today to let you know about a wonderful new software package that will dramatically increase your web site's visibility.  It's called The Spider, and I have been using it for several months and enjoyed a tremendous increase in my website's traffic.

This software has impressed me so much that I decided to buy the reseller rights to it.  And now, we are offering it on a FREE DEMO basis.  Before I let you in on our secret download location, let me tell you a bit more about it.

1) 1100 + Supported Search Engines (Pro), 450 for standard edition

2) Batch Processing - allows you to take control of your website promotions - for all of your pages and sites. With a built in on-board database and batch processing, you can accurately register as many sites or pages as you like, all at once. 

3) Categorized submissions - accuracy is critical when placing your site; our program recognizes and properly places you in all of our supported search engines. Don't be fooled by the competition - the shotgun approach does not work!

4) True CGI based registration - while other programs simply email your site information to search engine webmasters in the vain hope they will manually enter your information, The Search Engine Spider interacts with the server directly, custom formatting your site information for each and every supported engine. 

5) Small Size, Fast Execution : The Spider is written entirely in the C programming language, and takes advantage of the true 32 bit multithreaded programming environment provided therein. It's fast: in our internal testing, the new program will perform 450 individual registrations in just under 18 minutes. Testing was done on a 28.8 dialup line.

6) Automatic Update Feature: No more weekly and monthly downloads! In an effort to keep up to date with search engine changes and updates, we have now incorporated a feature that will automate this task. Here's how it works:
a.. Each time the program is loaded, it will automatically connect to our server and verify that the current search engine database is loaded on your user's machine. If it is not, it will automatically initiate a download.
b. Once the download is complete (typically 20-30 seconds on a 28.8K connection), normal program operation will resume with the new database.

7) Improved Error Checking: anytime an error is generated during submission, by any user anywhere, the program updates our server with the search engine name, time and date of the error, and the nature of the error. Our resource manager for this project checks his log daily and investigates each and every error and has the ability to dynamically and instantly update the master database with the corrections. Once the correction is made, the Automatic Update Feature kicks in, distributing the updated registration database to every user worldwide the next time they use the program.

To get your FREE DEMO of this amazing software, please visit:
http://www.getmoretraffic.com

If you would prefer us to send you a CD with The Spider, along with free demos of over 10 of our other web promotion software packages, please visit:
http://www.getmoretraffic.com/order/process_cd.htm

If you are having problems connecting to the above links, please give us a call at 773-271-8484 and we will arrange another way for you to get your FREE DEMO.

Thanks again for your time and please let me know if you have any questions.

I have uploaded to CRAN a port of Roger Koenker's
quantreg (2.0) package for S-plus. Two .zip files:

Quantreg-win    Precompiled for windows (wr06..., bdr0631)
Quantreg-gen    Only source.

There was some questions on the list about L1 regression, this package
could be used for that, too, but is more general. (the algorithm used
is a generalization of the one from S l1reg)

Subject: [R] R-0.63.1 library() command
Message-ID: <13931.55655.22099.100127@c1186.ae.ge.com>

Hello,
 I just installed 0.63.1 (from diffs, patch seemed to work OK). I just 
noticed that library() command is behaving differently. It is
outputting one line a time and I have to hit the "q" key to advance a
single line ! library(help=modreg) seems to be working OK. So are
other help commands (e.g. ?library). I can use less directly on the
LibIndex file without any problems (pages OK). What could be wrong?
I am on hpux10.20 using a bash shell, PAGER set to "less". I also
tried "more" or "most" : same problem. 
 TIA

An inelegant side effect of  .Platform$show.file(title)  which tries
to do things in a portable (even to Windows) manner. It seems that
this could use some rethinking.

PAGER="less -XE" should do the trick for now (no screen-switching,
exit on eof -- are there similar options for HP "more"?) Of course,
this also affects ordinary help pages, and it doesn't actually page if
you have more than a screenful of packages.

Windows DLLs are tricky business, anything may depend on anything.

  Main problem here is that Brian isn't lazy as I am. Hence, he recompiled
  R-0.63.1 just after the releasing for Unix starting from
  my experimental release which has support for batch under Win32
  (and adding some enhancements, too). In this release, there is
  a big dll (R.dll) with all the R code and other dll's must be linked
  against it. This implies that dll's linked as before against R.exe must be
  recompiled.
  During next days, I will (i) merge Brian's changes in my source,
  (ii) add a couple of other features (in particular support for animation
  without `tricks`) and (iii) make it available.
  After this, Brian wrote to me that he will provide binary version
  of the additional packages.
  In the meantime, note that Brian bdr... file contains support
  for compiling other packages under Windows.

First, I think Heberto Ghezzo missed the Subject: line and the crucial
word `Windows' or `win32' (since that message replied to was not from me,
and I can't find a single message which contains the informatin referred
to).

The current situation is that we can now build compiled packages that
work on  W95/8 and NT4.0, at least, but Guido and I have agreed to link
against the new R.dll and not R.exe which is how the packages currently
made available are linked. One day soon we will have a unified version
and this confusion will go away, but that depends on two very busy
people merging in each other's contributions and testing.  Until then I
have made available a development version for people who want to use
some of its features, and have received some very valuable feedback. It
uses my initials as I hoped that people would know to ask *me* not
Guido Masarotto or Robert Gentleman or .... or R-help!

Hi,

  I saw some ref to R on HDF site and found some e-mails regarding them on
Feb.
Has there ben any developement on either of these software (HDF or netCDF)?
  I am primary interested in NT side, but Unix side will help to some
degree.
  Thanks much in advance,

Before I start trying to write something myself, are there functions
for response surface analysis available in R or in a freely-available
S library?

I would like to be able to specify a formula, automatically generate
the full quadratic model, and do a canonical analysis of the quadratic
terms as in Box, Hunter, and Hunter (1978), "Statistics for
Experimenters", Wiley.

I looked in the index of Venables and Ripley (1997) and did not see
any mention of "response surface".

I wanted to produce a simple graph of Y~X with Y in three groups and would like to specify symbols and colours for each group. In the "notes" by Venables either pairs or coplot are mentioned to display multivariate variables but neither seem to apply.

Subject: [R] basic graphics
Message-ID: <199812072225.LAA11224@stat1.stat.auckland.ac.nz>

Here is a simple example showing how to use colors and symbols:

	# create some fake data, x, y, and group
	x <- runif(100)
	y <- runif(100)
	g <- rep(1:4, 25)

	# colors: plot with col=1 for group1, col=2 for group2 ...
	plot(x, y, col=g)

	# symbols: plot with pch=1 for group1, pch=2 for group2 ...
	plot(x, y, pch=g)

	# Both colors and symbols
	plot(x, y, col=g, pch=g)

	# customised colors and symbols
	plot(x, y, col=c("red","green","blue","yellow")[g])
	plot(x, y, pch=c(1,3,7)[g])

To see why these last two work, just print the value of

	c("red","green","blue","yellow")[g]

Hope this helps.

The problem is that way that the numbers are aligned on the grid.  In
the R image plot, the cells on the boundary are half the width/height
of those in the middle of the plot.  This is a artifact which occurs
because I wanted to overlay contours over the image data, and have
those contours extend to the edge of the plot -- this was a cheap and
nasty way of obtaining filled contours.

We will soon have genuinely filled contours and the necessity for
doing this kind of cheap trick will go away.  I've put a review of
image on the TODO list.

Subject: [R] R compile problems with AIX
Message-ID: <366D05DC.1FD275AA@ibwk.baum.ethz.ch>

Hello,

I've allways had some problems compiling R (R-62.x and R-63.x) on a AIX 4.2.1 System to the end:
make produces following output:
...
...
mkdir ../../../library/eda/R
ld: 0711-327 WARNING: Entry point not found: __start
ld: 0711-244 ERROR: No csects or exported symbols have been saved.
gnumake[4]: *** [eda.so] Error 8
gnumake[3]: *** [all] Error 1
gnumake[2]: *** [R] Error 1
gnumake[1]: *** [R] Error 1
gnumake: *** [R] Error 1

This seems to be a binder Error (appears also with aix-make)

any suggestions, how to solve this problem?

Attached is the config.log and and make's output
(I'm using make-3.76.1)

Thanks

F. Moro

I have successfully compiled R-0.63.1 on Linux. But, when I try to run it I get 
the message:

Fatal error: unable to open the base package

and R stops.

What is wrong?

The problem was due to an incomplete compilation after an attempt to
continue compilation after a stop due to the export-dynamic flag to the
compiler.

Now everything works OK!

Subject: [R] 'library' documentation
Message-ID: <366E57A9.5FBB9864@onaustralia.com.au>

In assembling a library, I noticed one or two things that caused me some
difficulty, and thought that these might also confuse others.

1) "R code files" indicates the _text_ version of the R code.  I didn't
realize this at first, and got parse errors until I looked inside one of
the other libraries.

2) "The code files to be installed must start with a (lower- or
uppercase) letter and have one of the extensions `.R', `.S', `.q', `.r',
or `.s'. "

In fact, they don't have to have any extension, and the libraries
supplied don't seem to have any either.  Am I missing something or is
this an historical artifact?

If it's appropriate to modify these, I'll be happy to submit an edited
.Rd file.

Subject: [R] R.dll
Message-ID: <A1AFC4253BA3D111BFF70001FA7E9AAC4DDBDC@EWFD19>

Hi,

  Is there any docs on R.dll? Or is it "use the source Luke" time? (The NT
0.63.1) Can anyone give me pointers on where to look? I am trying to wrap it
under a GUI. The bdr release has examples, but it seems to be limited in
scope.
  Has anyone compiled R under VC++. I see that the older version has been
compiled under VC++ at some point. Is this best place to start to see how to
get the new 0.63.1 compiled?
  I hope that I am not bugging anyone by restating and expanding on these
two questions, which I asked to some extent before. I am still just getting
familiar with R organization after installing it two weeks ago.
  
BTW: Thanks much to marcusd at cathcart.sysc.pdx.edu and Ben about their help
on HDF.

Are there any docs on anything in R?  I think it is a question of reading
the source code, but everything you are likely to need is in
src/gnuwin32/system.c

It may be possible, but I would not do this. For most purposes of R
packages it is just another DLL, and who cares what compiler was used? And
for some (such as calls to unif_rand) you really don't want to know how
each compiler does it.  (Unlike Unix systems with ELF, the format of many
parts of Windows DLLs is just not defined. This includes what fo do with
return values and how small structures are passed, at least.)  From the
point of view of using the DLL from a GUI application, all the interface
is in system.c, but R_Read/WriteConsole is about all you need to cope
with.

My problems are very similar with R-63.1 on Red Hat linux 5.1. './configure'
and 'make' seem to work and R-binary and the R script are created but when I
type R I get 'bash: R command not found'.

When I see the config.log file It seems that the problem is related to the 
conftest.c program with gcc. The result in the config.log file is 1>&5.
Futhermore no -xxxx files or directories are available after the gcc conftest.c
command.

Is there anything to do?

I have had an identical problem with rw0630 under Win95. Perhaps it is a 
problem of *.txt file, since the re-exporting helped (I have exported the data from 
Excel97 into the *.txt).
The same (R crash) happened when I played with the read.table("several_non-
txt_files"). Can this be a typical read.table behaviour when the data format is 
not recognized?

This problem occurs on NT4.0 when the last line of the file
does not end in with a carriage return (or carriage-return
+ line feed I suppose since we're on windows). Edit the
file and just add a return character at the end.

A related problem occurs when editing a function within R.
If the last line of the file does not end with a carriage return
you get a syntax error, even though the function looks syntactically
correct.

I have told Guido about these problems.

  I hope to have fixed this problem in my sources. At least, I
  can now 'read.table' some small files (without a CR on the last line)
  that before gave a crash and  'source' some other files
  which before gave "syntax error".
  
  In few days, the new version should be ready.

The preferred way is via setting the environment variable PAGER.

In Bourne shells
	PAGER=less; export PAGER
In *C* shells
	setenv PAGER less

Dear friends. This is again a very simple question, and I hope you will accept it. I have a dataset with variables in columns all with their names. Now I want to add a column indicating simply identity of patients, numbered according to row. There are 34 rows.
So I did:
>ID <- c(1:34)
but was not allowed to
>Ptt <- cbind(patients,ID) 
and was informed that
>Error: names attribute must be the same length as the vector
So, I removed the names
>newname <- names(patients)
>names(patients) <- NULL
>ptt <- cbind(patients,ID)
but still got
Error: names attribute must be the same length as the vector
in spite of
> names(ID)
NULL
> names(patients)
NULL
> attr(patients,"names")
NULL
> attr(ID,"names")
NULL
One thing, is that inconsistent ?
Short of editing my data file, which would not be very difficult in this case, how could I do it ?
Sincerely yours
Troels Ring, MD

There may be a problem with the way R is handling your request but I
think we would need to know a bit more about the form of the data
before we could decide.

Your initial description sounds as if the data are in a "data frame",
the class of object created by the "read.table" function.  One way to
discover the form of the data is to use the "class" or, more
generally, the "data.class" functions.  For example, data I am using
in a lecture today has this form
 R> T10.5  # Average SAT math scores by sex - Hocking, table 10.5
    Year Mmath Fmath
 1    67   514   467
 2    68   512   470
 3    69   513   470
 4    70   509   465
 5    71   507   466
 6    72   505   461
 7    73   502   460
 8    74   501   459
 9    75   495   449
 10   76   497   446
 11   77   497   445
 12   78   494   444
 R> data.class( T10.5 )
 [1] "data.frame"

If you find your data are in a matrix and you wish to convert them to
a data frame, you can use the "as.data.frame" function.  

 R> matSAT <- as.matrix( T10.5 )
 R> matSAT
    Year Mmath Fmath
 1    67   514   467
 2    68   512   470
 3    69   513   470
 4    70   509   465
 5    71   507   466
 6    72   505   461
 7    73   502   460
 8    74   501   459
 9    75   495   449
 10   76   497   446
 11   77   497   445
 12   78   494   444
 R> data.class( matSAT )
 [1] "matrix"
 R> dfSAT <- as.data.frame( matSAT )
 R> data.class( dfSAT )
 [1] "data.frame"

Generally data frames are preferred to matrices for storing data sets.
If your data are in a data frame then you can create a new variable by
assigning a component of that name in the data frame.  It looks like

 R> dfSAT$ID <- 1:nrow(dfSAT)
 R> dfSAT
    Year Mmath Fmath ID
 1    67   514   467  1
 2    68   512   470  2
 3    69   513   470  3
 4    70   509   465  4
 5    71   507   466  5
 6    72   505   461  6
 7    73   502   460  7
 8    74   501   459  8
 9    75   495   449  9
 10   76   497   446 10
 11   77   497   445 11
 12   78   494   444 12

No!  They do, but you don't see them easily:
> palette()
[1] "black"   "red"     "green3"  "blue"    "cyan"    "magenta" "yellow" 
[8] "white"  

I.e., col=7 is "yellow"  (per default, you can always change this!)
      col=8 is "white"
both of which are hard to see with a white background.

Try to say first

	par(bg = "gray80") # or something else between white and black

and you will see the  "yellow" and "white".


    PaulG> matplot(t(matrix(1:8,8,20)), type="l", lty=1:8, col=1:8)

    PaulG> they do not appear in the graph.

as above, they do, look at it after   par(bg = "gray")# or "gray80"

For further ``color manipulation'' in R,
please look at the help page for palette and its examples and the further
pages in 'see also'.

As another illustrative example for matplot(), try e.g.,

par(bg="light blue")
palette(heat.colors(20))
matplot(t(matrix(1:20,20, 2)), type="l", lty=1:4, col=1:20, lwd=2)

------

The other ``phenomenon'' you observe really comes from  
matplot()'s default of  "col = 1:6" (and then recycling).
It makes sense to only use ``a few'' different colors in a general matplot
(where lines cross,...).
S default even recycles only four colors  (col=1:4).

Usually the problem is that people do not know how to do that in the
Windows versions. The easiest way (and the only easy way on NT4 with
rw0630) is to set up a shortcut to R.exe on the desktop or on the start
menu, and put

path\to\bin\R.exe --vsize 10

as the target.  As I find both the default heap and the default cons cells
too small, I have my shortcut with 

--vsize 6 --nsize 250000

That makes the process take about 14Mb, and on a 32Mb machine that
is about as much as is comfortable without paging.

>   (ps) And, please, don't use numeric address.

Yes, we have made that point to him via the list before. Could Peter
Mandeville please use a signature?

I have looked inside  the data  directory  of MASS,  and see that  the

Actually I do get the scoping bug. I had a variable called x in the global
environment before, which is why it worked.

Ok, the solution is to change the line
	frm <- eval(m, sys.parent())
to
	frm <- eval(m, sys.frame(sys.parent()))

about 10 lines down from the top of locfit().

Correct.
Actually, one may have to replace all occurrences of sys.parent() by
sys.frame(sys.parent()).

Subject: [R] trellis,nlme
Message-ID: <000f01be2a0d$7fa1bc80$2c4fa8c0@tring.stofanet.dk>

Dear friends. I need to model a non-linear function between two measurements done 13 times in 69 patients. I've fitted a spline in Genstat, and it looks interesting and plausible to me (at least), but I wanted to compare with other methods. Is there any way of mixed modelling of non-linear functions available in R at the moment ? Perhaps someday nlme will be ported, hopefully. Also, will trellis functions be ported (a Christmas present ?)
Sincerely yours

Message-ID: <Pine.NEB.4.02.9812171711220.14704-100000@mathfs.math.montana.edu>



Just after R-0.63.0 came out I reported a problem to the list.  I was
unable to get ./configure to complete it's job, because it couldn't find a
working fortran.  It stopped after trying to test for underscore in
subroutine names.  This was especially perplexing, since I could still
configure the older version (I had 62.2) with no error messages.
I tried suggestions of B.D. Ripley and others to set
the fortran compiler in config.site, but those did not work.  I had
exactly the same problem with R-0.63.1.  Today I discovered that 

./configure --with-f77  does work.  I wonder why it didn't work to set it
in config.site.  When is config.site used?

Subject: [R] R 0.63.1 for Windows
Message-ID: <19981221131443.A8032@sirio.stat.unipd.it>

A new version of R for Windows is available from CRAN in directory
bin/windows/windows-NT. This supersedes rw0630, rw63-io, bdr0631 and earlier
versions.  It runs on Windows 95, 98, NT4 (on i386), at least.

There are two executables, Rgui.exe and Rterm.exe.

NEW FEATURES

  Will run from NT command line.

  No `tricks' are needed for animated graphics.

  The windows are much more responsive.

  R commands can be interrupted by Esc.

  Rterm allows batch mode operation and can also be run in 
  inferior-R-mode under NTEmacs.

  There is a history mechanism for graphics plots.
  
  Graphics can be copied to the clipboard.

  Commands history is saved between session (only by Rgui.exe).
  
  Saved images and user profile are called .RData and .Rprofile as under Unix
  (before they were RData and Rprofile).

PACKAGES:

Pre-compiled packages for this (and hopefully all subsequent versions)
are available at CRAN/bin/windows-NT/contrib.

My question is: if I want to recompile and reinstall a newer version of R
under linux, must I remove the old binaries previously installed ?
If yes where are located them?
Thanks!

Andrea.

This can happen. The default location of $RHOME has been changed at
some point (was /usr/local/share/R, now /usr/local/lib/R), or you may
have explicitly set it otherwise. If the location of $RHOME and the
startup script is unchanged, then I wouldn't expect problems, but it
should do no harm to delete them first in either case - but note that
this might kill add-on packages as well.

Where you put them... ;)

Seriously:

[pd at butterfly R]$ which R                     
/usr/local/bin/R
[pd at butterfly R]$ more `!!`
more `which R`
#!/bin/sh
# Shell wrapper for R executable.

RHOME=/usr/local/lib/R
export RHOME
...

If the startup script is gone, consider something like

find /usr -name R -prune

Subject: [R] R for Win 3.1(1)?
Message-ID: <Pine.SUN.3.95.981228122944.8844A-100000@paca>


  I've been happily using R on SunOS/Solaris for a while, but am now
trying to develop some course work on Windows.  I know the real action is
on Win32, but I have access to a laptop which runs 3.1 and I thought it
might be useful to develop on the lowest common denominator anyway.

  I downloaded "tmp.zip" (dated 03 September 1998) from
/R/CRAN/bin/windows/windows, which unzipped to Rjune.exe, which when run
under my setup said it couldn't run in DOS mode and refused to do anything
else. Should I try "oldtmp.zip" instead, or back up farther?  I'd like to
avoid old bugs, if possible ... 

  Any suggestions (particularly from anyone who has a working 3.1 setup)
would be much appreciated.  I'm not eager to compile from scratch, but I
could try it if anyone thinks that would help (Borland C).

  thanks,
     Ben

Message-ID: <199812300301.WAA04562@pakwan>

I am looking for a reference that describes the syntax for putting 
mathematical text on a plot. I managed to discover some of the syntax in the 
manual pages for "text", "title", and "legend". In particular, I am looking 
for the syntax for making subscripts. I did not have much luck searching the 
S-news archives and http://stat.ethz.ch/R/manual/.

Thank you,

Look in the $RHOME/doc/manual directory.  There is a LaTeX source file
called plotmath.tex that provides some documentation.  If things are
set up properly in that directory you should be able to run

 make Man-plotmath.ps

and get a PostScript file of two pages of documentation.

You are not likely to find this in S-news: it is an faq (literally, hance
no caps) there, but the answers are different. One answer for S-PLUS -- use
psfrag and incorporate the figures in a LaTeX document -- is also probably
the highest-quality solution for R.

Indeed, it is one of the few things documented about R (the other
major one being the format of .Rd files).  However, I would like to
point that the the V&R `R Complements' do have a concise description
of this culled from all those sources.

If you are quick you should be able to pick up one of
	ftp://stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/annotation-a4.ps.gz
	ftp://stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/annotation-letter.ps.gz
(choose the one appropriate for your paper size).

This is an paper about the math annotation stuff.  I am about to sign
over the copyright on this to JCGS and will have to remove these copies
when I do.

The paper has a summary of the annotation capabilities and some
explanation of the approach and its difficulties.  A manual style
description will be available in its place soon(ish).
