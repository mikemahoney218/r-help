Subject: [R] dyn.load(now = FALSE) not actually lazy?
Message-ID: <CAPZyOoJdGJ6yYhtmTyCR3v+=6H6XprxSsEG5bKwNbOTPqoJdTA@mail.gmail.com>

On Linux, if I have a .so file that has a dependency on another .so, and I
`dyn.load(now=FALSE)` the first one, R seems to try to resolve the symbols
immediately, causing the load to fail.

For example, I have `libtorch` installed on my HPC. Note that it links to
various libs such as `libcudart.so` and `libmkl_intel_lp64.so.2` which
aren't currently in my library path:

?  ~ ldd
/stornext/System/data/nvidia/libtorch-gpu/libtorch-gpu-1.12.1/lib/libtorch_cpu.so
        linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffcab58c000)
        libgomp.so.1 =>
/stornext/System/data/apps/gcc/gcc-11.2.0/lib64/libgomp.so.1
(0x00007f8cb22bf000)
        libpthread.so.0 => /lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f8cb20a3000)
        libc10.so =>
/stornext/System/data/nvidia/libtorch-gpu/libtorch-gpu-1.12.1/lib/libc10.so

        librt.so.1 => /lib64/librt.so.1 (0x00007f8cb1a19000)
        libgcc_s.so.1 =>
/stornext/System/data/apps/gcc/gcc-11.2.0/lib64/libgcc_s.so.1
(0x00007f8cb1801000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f8cb15fd000)
        libmkl_intel_lp64.so.2 => not found
        libmkl_gnu_thread.so.2 => not found
        libmkl_core.so.2 => not found
        libm.so.6 => /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007f8cb12fb000)
        libcudart.so.11.0 => not found

Then in R, if I try to load that same file:

>
dyn.load("/stornext/System/data/nvidia/libtorch-gpu/libtorch-gpu-1.12.1/lib/libtorch_cpu.so",
now=FALSE)
Error in
dyn.load("/stornext/System/data/nvidia/libtorch-gpu/libtorch-gpu-1.12.1/lib/libtorch_cpu.so",
 :
  unable to load shared object

  libmkl_intel_lp64.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
directory

Is this a bug in the `dyn.load` implementation for R? If not, why is it
behaving like this? What should I do about it?

For reference, I'm on CentOS 7, with Linux
kernel 3.10.0-1160.81.1.el7.x86_64.

According to the help page for dyn.load, I think this is within the 
allowed behaviour:

"now:
a logical controlling whether all symbols are resolved (and relocated) 
immediately the library is loaded or deferred until they are used. This 
control is useful for developers testing whether a library is complete 
and has all the necessary symbols, and for users to ignore missing 
symbols. Whether this has any effect is system-dependent."

It appears to be intended for a DLL that doesn't define all the symbols 
that your program will use, not for a DLL that has external references 
that can't be resolved.  And there's that last sentence.

I think for what you want, you'd have to write the DLL (i.e. libtorch) 
in such a way that it does delayed loading of its dependencies.

On Unix-like systems, dyn.load forwards its arguments to dlopen(). It
should be possible to confirm with a debugger that R passes RTLD_NOW to
dlopen() when calling dyn.load(now = TRUE) and RTLD_LAZY when calling
dyn.load(now = FALSE).

I don't know for sure why the symbols are being resolved despite you
asked the linker not to. Did something in the system set the
LD_BIND_NOW environment variable? Do any of the libraries in the
dependency tree have any constructors (C++ or
__attribute__((constructor)) or otherwise mentioned in .ini* sections)
that rely on MKL being available at initialisation time?

If you launch R with the environment variable LD_DEBUG=libs set, the
debugging output may shine some light on the problem.

Message-ID: <CABxY9BP_j4Orh8WJv3k30egpTd7X-ins4Zbdq4FJBe9vtwsapA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello   I've successfully installed the package "Detpack" and remembered to
call it via library()  But when I try to use the functions i get this:


chi2testuniform(vals, 0.05)

Error in chi2testuniform(vals, 0.05) :
  could not find function "chi2testuniform"


And yet this function (amongst other which also are not recognised) are all
listed on the CRAN page:
http://cran.nexr.com/web/packages/detpack/detpack.pdf

I can't remember anything like this happening before - as far as I can see
I don't need to load or write anything else before executing the function
and I can't find references to any problems with this package on the net
Can anyone cast light on what's happening?  Thanks Nick Wray

Detpack or detpack?

What happens when you try detpack::chi2testuniform(...) ?

I did use "detpack" ie not with a capital

detpack::chi2testuniform(vals,0.05)
gives this:

Error: 'chi2testuniform' is not an exported object from 'namespace:detpack'
??
Thanks Nick

The only exports from detpack are these:

   > library(detpack)
   > ls(2)
   [1] "det.construct" "det.cut"       "det.de"        "det.leafs" 
"det.query"     "det.rnd"       "det1"
   [8] "det2"

It looks as though the author of detpack documented chi2testuniform, but 
forgot to export it.  You can see the source of the version on CRAN here:

   https://github.com/cran/detpack

The author used Roxygen2, but apparently forgot to say @export before 
that function (and some others).  The package tests perfectly OK on 
CRAN, because none of the examples made it into the help pages, where 
they would have failed.

Hi Ivan,

Thanks for the suggestion.

I found that libpqwalreceiver.so, which is part of pgsql-15.1, made for a
simpler example of my issue. So, using your advice, I ran the following in
my shell:
LD_DEBUG=libs R -e
'dyn.load("/stornext/System/data/tools/pgsql/pgsql-15.1/lib/libpqwalreceiver.so",
now=FALSE)'

I have attached the relevant part of the output from this command below.
The gist of it is that, indeed, R starts to look for dependent libraries
even if now=FALSE. Maybe it is the case that, as Duncan suggests, this is
intended behaviour? But I think it's not ideal behaviour because otherwise
it requires you to topologically sort all library dependencies and load
them in the optimal order, which is very difficult to do. Is there someone
involved in R development who can explain this behaviour to me?

Cheers.

I don't think that R does that. Here's a program that should do the
same thing that R does when you call dyn.load(now = FALSE):

#include <dlfcn.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
	if (argc != 2) {
		printf("Usage: %s path/to/library.so\n", argv[0]);
		return -1;
	}

	void * ptr = dlopen(argv[1], RTLD_LAZY);
	if (!ptr) {
		printf("%s\n", dlerror());
		return 1;
	}

	dlclose(ptr);
	return 0;
}

Link it with -ldl. If you launch it with LD_DEBUG=all (see also: the
output when you launch something with LD_DEBUG=help), it should give you
even more information about the shared object loading process.

> error: symbol lookup error: undefined symbol: work_mem (fatal)

I think I have an explanation for this. work_mem turns out to be a
global variable, not a function:

https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/include/miscadmin.h;h=96b3a1e1a0770bdbc25701b5a41e2001a7222b3b;hb=117d2604c2a59eb853e894410b94b4c453f8bd43#l261
https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/utils/init/globals.c;h=1b1d8142548aaf1234fcf1fc92753b9a8b8b3537;hb=117d2604c2a59eb853e894410b94b4c453f8bd43#l125

Indeed, libpqwalreceiver includes the header where the variable is
declared and accesses it:

https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/replication/libpqwalreceiver/libpqwalreceiver.c;h=560ec974fa71444f1cb90e5098cef3c712e5b758;hb=117d2604c2a59eb853e894410b94b4c453f8bd43#l968

I guess that there's no way for the dynamic loader to postpone the
resolution of an import that's a variable, because it has to be a
pointer where the code should be able to read and write data. For
functions, there's stubs in the procedure linkage table that can
resolve the symbol later because they are functions and can do anything.

I could be wrong about my explanation. If you'd like to learn more
about this topic, one way to do that would be to start with Ulrich
Drepper's articles: https://akkadia.org/drepper/dsohowto.pdf

Hi,

I hope that you are doing well.

I am Md Hossain, trying to fit the ARIMAX model in RJAGS. However, I got an
error message while I ran the code. Initially, I am using data obtained
from R-package then I will implement it into real data.

The code and error message are given below.

library(rjags)
#### load the data
data("mtcars")

#### select the response and predictor variables
y <- mtcars$mpg
x <- mtcars[,c("wt","qsec")]

### write the JAGS model code
jags_arimax_model <- "
model {

 Models
Message-ID: <CALABNevL7o=4hmB2v2G2PQmeCUcX7oa7YuPMfZ_Q6Az2RoL-pQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

Our new package {clarify} has been released. {clarify} provides
simulation-based inference as an alternative to the delta method for
interpretable quantities derived from model parameters, like average
marginal effects, dose-response functions, and predictions at
representative values. Also provided are methods for combining such
quantities across multiply imputed datasets.

Those of you who have used Clarify for Stata or the retired R package
{Zelig} will find similar and expanded capabilities in {clarify}.

Install {clarify} using
install.packages("clarify")

CRAN page:
https://cran.r-project.org/package=clarify

{clarify} website:
https://iqss.github.io/clarify/

Thank you!

Subject: [R] Lazy-load corrupt?
Message-ID: <CABxY9BNVKjvLs+KjnitqpCnNfdVN_sd3pEeqsdT705REJ2YckA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello  When trying to call various packages eg
library(raster)
library(sp)
library(rgdal)

I get this error message:
Loading required package: sp
Error: package or namespace load failed for ?sp? in get0(name, envir =
where, mode = "function", inherits = FALSE):
 lazy-load database 'C:/PROGRA~1/R/R-42~1.1/library/base/R/base.rdb' is
corrupt
Error: package ?sp? could not be loaded
In addition: Warning messages:
1: package ?raster? was built under R version 4.2.2
2: package ?sp? was built under R version 4.2.2
3: In get0(name, envir = where, mode = "function", inherits = FALSE) :
  restarting interrupted promise evaluation
4: In get0(name, envir = where, mode = "function", inherits = FALSE) :
  internal error -3 in R_decompress1


Other packages load fine (and the packages above load OK on my spare
laptop) but I'm imagining that this means that I have to uninstall my
current R and reinstall the latest version - but before I go through all
that can anyone confirm that that is indeed what I need to do or is there
some other problem?

Thanks Nick Wray

Sorry -- I am too ignorant to answer your query.

But, just curious: Is there a good reason why you would *not* want to
install the latest version of R and your packages?

Cheers,
Bert

This often indicates you need to restart R.

Subject: [R] Extracting data using subset function
Message-ID: <CAEezrQRWrA4VEFxH7rbq0LT3=buT030pfi15UQ7X7i1VCFyoDw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I want to create a vector p and extract first 20 observations using subset
function based on logical condition.

My code is below

p <- 0:100

I know i can extract the first 20 observations using the following command.

q <- p[1:20]

But I want to extract the first 20 observations using subset function which
requires a logical condition. I am not able to frame the logical condition.

The code should be

q <- subset(p, logical condition)

I am not able to do it. Please let me know what you think.

Best regards,
Upananda

Do you mean something like the following?  Here the first elements are
selected by subset function.

Thank you. It means we can not use the subset function here.

No, it means what it says: it is best used interactively rather than in functions. That is not saying you cannot use it... merely that you should probably use it interactively.

The fact is, though, that integer indexing is much simpler and clearer for your particular example than subset is.

q <- p[1:20]
q2 <- subset( p, 1:100 <= 20) # 1:100 are positions

I think that you are manufacturing an unnecessary difficulty.  If you
want the first 20 entries of p, use p[1:20]!!!

However, if you obdurately *insist* on using subset() you could do

    subset(p,(1:length(p)) <= 20)

This works, but makes a mountain out of a molehill.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

Hi Jeff,

Thanks for your reply. What do you exactly mean by "interactively"?  Would
you please give me an example?

Just to build the mountain a little higher, I would use

   subset(p, seq_along(p) <= 20)

You should generally avoid expressions like "1:length(p)", because they 
don't do what you would expect in the unusual case that p is length 0.

Even in cases where you know p is not length 0, it's a good habit to get 
into so that in the future you don't get surprised.

I will not (re-)define the basic terms used in describing how R is used... do read [1] for that.

[1] https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#Writing-your-own-functions, also via RShowDoc("R-intro"), in particular contrast section 1.5 vs section 10.

A major question is why you ask how to use the subset function rather than asking how to get your job done.

As you note, the simple way to get the first N items is to use indexing. If you absolutely positively insist on using subset, place your data into something like a data.frame and add a column and use that.

Say you have N items, so that length() or nrow() return N. You can add a column called index whose entries are 1:N and do your subset to get all rows where the condition is "index <= N" or something like that. 

If you want just the first N (not N at a time in several tries) simply used head(data, N) and that gets you the first N.

And if you are interested in learning other packages like dplyr in the tidyverse, it has oodles of ways to select based on row numbers. One example is top_n(...) and another is slice(first, last)  and in some contexts such as the filter() function, there is a sort of internal function you can use called n() that contains the index of the entry within any grouping so filter(mydata, n() <= 20) might get what you want.

Note that the above requires care as some things work on vectors and others assume a data.frame, albeit you can make a data.frame containing a single vector.

Thank you. It means we can not use the subset function here.

Hi Upananda,
As a couple of respondents noted, you only need the logical statement,
not subset().

You did "frame the logical condition" in your example, for if you use
the extraction operator "[" this will work:
subset(p,(1:length(p)) <= 20)
as Jeff already pointed out. Obviously it is easier to write:
p[(1:length(p)) <= 20]

Let's say you want to select the odd numbers in p:
p<-1:10
as.logical(p%%2)
[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
p[as.logical(p%%2)]
[1] 1 3 5 7 9
The as.logical() has to be included as the extractor function tries
use integers as indices

So the problem is really to reduce your selection criteria to a vector
of TRUER/FALSE values.

I tend not to teach subset() as indexing is needed anyway and hence 
subset() is just an extra level of cpmplexity that is not needed.
Also note what ?subset warns about.

Hello,

Yes you can:


subset(p, p %in% 1:20)
# [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

Hello,

But a much more natural the *first* n observations is with function head.


head(p, n = 20)
# [1]  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19


Hope this helps,

Aaarrrggghhh.  That was a dumb-dumb on my part.  As Burns said to
Ripley (fortunes::fortune(26)), good catch.

Thanks.

In reading the post again, it sounds like the question is how to create a logical condition that translates as 1:N is TRUE. Someone hinted along those lines. 

So one WAY I might suggest is you construct a logical vector as shown below. I give an example of a bunch of 9 primes and you want only the first 5.

> vec <- c(1,2,3,5,7,11,13,17, 19)
> length(vec)
[1] 9
> N <- 5
> choose <- rep(TRUE, N)
> choose
[1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
> subset(vec, choose)        # will fail as the remaining are recycled or assumed to be true
[1]  1  2  3  5  7 11 13 17 19
> tot = length(vec)
> choose <- c(rep(TRUE, N), rep(FALSE, tot - N))
> choose
[1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
> subset(vec, choose)
[1] 1 2 3 5 7

The end shows you need to create N Boolean TRUE values and tot-N FALSE to make a vector of the same length as the first so everything is indexed.

Does something like this meet your needs?

Realistically, the above technique generalizes to more complex cases decently. But sometimes, head(0 and other things I mentioned earlier work quite well.

Hi Avi,

Thanks a lot. This worked well.

My sincere gratitude to you for teaching me. I am also grateful to
previous forum contributors, who have given me the various dimensions to
think and solve the problem. It has really helped to enhance my
understanding of subsetting function.

Thank you once again to all of you.

Regards,
Upananda Pani
