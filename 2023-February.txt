Subject: [R] dyn.load(now = FALSE) not actually lazy?
Message-ID: <CAPZyOoJdGJ6yYhtmTyCR3v+=6H6XprxSsEG5bKwNbOTPqoJdTA@mail.gmail.com>

On Linux, if I have a .so file that has a dependency on another .so, and I
`dyn.load(now=FALSE)` the first one, R seems to try to resolve the symbols
immediately, causing the load to fail.

For example, I have `libtorch` installed on my HPC. Note that it links to
various libs such as `libcudart.so` and `libmkl_intel_lp64.so.2` which
aren't currently in my library path:

?  ~ ldd
/stornext/System/data/nvidia/libtorch-gpu/libtorch-gpu-1.12.1/lib/libtorch_cpu.so
        linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffcab58c000)
        libgomp.so.1 =>
/stornext/System/data/apps/gcc/gcc-11.2.0/lib64/libgomp.so.1
(0x00007f8cb22bf000)
        libpthread.so.0 => /lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f8cb20a3000)
        libc10.so =>
/stornext/System/data/nvidia/libtorch-gpu/libtorch-gpu-1.12.1/lib/libc10.so

        librt.so.1 => /lib64/librt.so.1 (0x00007f8cb1a19000)
        libgcc_s.so.1 =>
/stornext/System/data/apps/gcc/gcc-11.2.0/lib64/libgcc_s.so.1
(0x00007f8cb1801000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f8cb15fd000)
        libmkl_intel_lp64.so.2 => not found
        libmkl_gnu_thread.so.2 => not found
        libmkl_core.so.2 => not found
        libm.so.6 => /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007f8cb12fb000)
        libcudart.so.11.0 => not found

Then in R, if I try to load that same file:

>
dyn.load("/stornext/System/data/nvidia/libtorch-gpu/libtorch-gpu-1.12.1/lib/libtorch_cpu.so",
now=FALSE)
Error in
dyn.load("/stornext/System/data/nvidia/libtorch-gpu/libtorch-gpu-1.12.1/lib/libtorch_cpu.so",
 :
  unable to load shared object

  libmkl_intel_lp64.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
directory

Is this a bug in the `dyn.load` implementation for R? If not, why is it
behaving like this? What should I do about it?

For reference, I'm on CentOS 7, with Linux
kernel 3.10.0-1160.81.1.el7.x86_64.

According to the help page for dyn.load, I think this is within the 
allowed behaviour:

"now:
a logical controlling whether all symbols are resolved (and relocated) 
immediately the library is loaded or deferred until they are used. This 
control is useful for developers testing whether a library is complete 
and has all the necessary symbols, and for users to ignore missing 
symbols. Whether this has any effect is system-dependent."

It appears to be intended for a DLL that doesn't define all the symbols 
that your program will use, not for a DLL that has external references 
that can't be resolved.  And there's that last sentence.

I think for what you want, you'd have to write the DLL (i.e. libtorch) 
in such a way that it does delayed loading of its dependencies.

On Unix-like systems, dyn.load forwards its arguments to dlopen(). It
should be possible to confirm with a debugger that R passes RTLD_NOW to
dlopen() when calling dyn.load(now = TRUE) and RTLD_LAZY when calling
dyn.load(now = FALSE).

I don't know for sure why the symbols are being resolved despite you
asked the linker not to. Did something in the system set the
LD_BIND_NOW environment variable? Do any of the libraries in the
dependency tree have any constructors (C++ or
__attribute__((constructor)) or otherwise mentioned in .ini* sections)
that rely on MKL being available at initialisation time?

If you launch R with the environment variable LD_DEBUG=libs set, the
debugging output may shine some light on the problem.

Message-ID: <CABxY9BP_j4Orh8WJv3k30egpTd7X-ins4Zbdq4FJBe9vtwsapA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello   I've successfully installed the package "Detpack" and remembered to
call it via library()  But when I try to use the functions i get this:


chi2testuniform(vals, 0.05)

Error in chi2testuniform(vals, 0.05) :
  could not find function "chi2testuniform"


And yet this function (amongst other which also are not recognised) are all
listed on the CRAN page:
http://cran.nexr.com/web/packages/detpack/detpack.pdf

I can't remember anything like this happening before - as far as I can see
I don't need to load or write anything else before executing the function
and I can't find references to any problems with this package on the net
Can anyone cast light on what's happening?  Thanks Nick Wray

Detpack or detpack?

What happens when you try detpack::chi2testuniform(...) ?

I did use "detpack" ie not with a capital

detpack::chi2testuniform(vals,0.05)
gives this:

Error: 'chi2testuniform' is not an exported object from 'namespace:detpack'
??
Thanks Nick

The only exports from detpack are these:

   > library(detpack)
   > ls(2)
   [1] "det.construct" "det.cut"       "det.de"        "det.leafs" 
"det.query"     "det.rnd"       "det1"
   [8] "det2"

It looks as though the author of detpack documented chi2testuniform, but 
forgot to export it.  You can see the source of the version on CRAN here:

   https://github.com/cran/detpack

The author used Roxygen2, but apparently forgot to say @export before 
that function (and some others).  The package tests perfectly OK on 
CRAN, because none of the examples made it into the help pages, where 
they would have failed.

Hi Ivan,

Thanks for the suggestion.

I found that libpqwalreceiver.so, which is part of pgsql-15.1, made for a
simpler example of my issue. So, using your advice, I ran the following in
my shell:
LD_DEBUG=libs R -e
'dyn.load("/stornext/System/data/tools/pgsql/pgsql-15.1/lib/libpqwalreceiver.so",
now=FALSE)'

I have attached the relevant part of the output from this command below.
The gist of it is that, indeed, R starts to look for dependent libraries
even if now=FALSE. Maybe it is the case that, as Duncan suggests, this is
intended behaviour? But I think it's not ideal behaviour because otherwise
it requires you to topologically sort all library dependencies and load
them in the optimal order, which is very difficult to do. Is there someone
involved in R development who can explain this behaviour to me?

Cheers.

I don't think that R does that. Here's a program that should do the
same thing that R does when you call dyn.load(now = FALSE):

#include <dlfcn.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
	if (argc != 2) {
		printf("Usage: %s path/to/library.so\n", argv[0]);
		return -1;
	}

	void * ptr = dlopen(argv[1], RTLD_LAZY);
	if (!ptr) {
		printf("%s\n", dlerror());
		return 1;
	}

	dlclose(ptr);
	return 0;
}

Link it with -ldl. If you launch it with LD_DEBUG=all (see also: the
output when you launch something with LD_DEBUG=help), it should give you
even more information about the shared object loading process.

> error: symbol lookup error: undefined symbol: work_mem (fatal)

I think I have an explanation for this. work_mem turns out to be a
global variable, not a function:

https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/include/miscadmin.h;h=96b3a1e1a0770bdbc25701b5a41e2001a7222b3b;hb=117d2604c2a59eb853e894410b94b4c453f8bd43#l261
https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/utils/init/globals.c;h=1b1d8142548aaf1234fcf1fc92753b9a8b8b3537;hb=117d2604c2a59eb853e894410b94b4c453f8bd43#l125

Indeed, libpqwalreceiver includes the header where the variable is
declared and accesses it:

https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/replication/libpqwalreceiver/libpqwalreceiver.c;h=560ec974fa71444f1cb90e5098cef3c712e5b758;hb=117d2604c2a59eb853e894410b94b4c453f8bd43#l968

I guess that there's no way for the dynamic loader to postpone the
resolution of an import that's a variable, because it has to be a
pointer where the code should be able to read and write data. For
functions, there's stubs in the procedure linkage table that can
resolve the symbol later because they are functions and can do anything.

I could be wrong about my explanation. If you'd like to learn more
about this topic, one way to do that would be to start with Ulrich
Drepper's articles: https://akkadia.org/drepper/dsohowto.pdf

Hi,

I hope that you are doing well.

I am Md Hossain, trying to fit the ARIMAX model in RJAGS. However, I got an
error message while I ran the code. Initially, I am using data obtained
from R-package then I will implement it into real data.

The code and error message are given below.

library(rjags)
#### load the data
data("mtcars")

#### select the response and predictor variables
y <- mtcars$mpg
x <- mtcars[,c("wt","qsec")]

### write the JAGS model code
jags_arimax_model <- "
model {

 Models
Message-ID: <CALABNevL7o=4hmB2v2G2PQmeCUcX7oa7YuPMfZ_Q6Az2RoL-pQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

Our new package {clarify} has been released. {clarify} provides
simulation-based inference as an alternative to the delta method for
interpretable quantities derived from model parameters, like average
marginal effects, dose-response functions, and predictions at
representative values. Also provided are methods for combining such
quantities across multiply imputed datasets.

Those of you who have used Clarify for Stata or the retired R package
{Zelig} will find similar and expanded capabilities in {clarify}.

Install {clarify} using
install.packages("clarify")

CRAN page:
https://cran.r-project.org/package=clarify

{clarify} website:
https://iqss.github.io/clarify/

Thank you!

Subject: [R] Lazy-load corrupt?
Message-ID: <CABxY9BNVKjvLs+KjnitqpCnNfdVN_sd3pEeqsdT705REJ2YckA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello  When trying to call various packages eg
library(raster)
library(sp)
library(rgdal)

I get this error message:
Loading required package: sp
Error: package or namespace load failed for ?sp? in get0(name, envir =
where, mode = "function", inherits = FALSE):
 lazy-load database 'C:/PROGRA~1/R/R-42~1.1/library/base/R/base.rdb' is
corrupt
Error: package ?sp? could not be loaded
In addition: Warning messages:
1: package ?raster? was built under R version 4.2.2
2: package ?sp? was built under R version 4.2.2
3: In get0(name, envir = where, mode = "function", inherits = FALSE) :
  restarting interrupted promise evaluation
4: In get0(name, envir = where, mode = "function", inherits = FALSE) :
  internal error -3 in R_decompress1


Other packages load fine (and the packages above load OK on my spare
laptop) but I'm imagining that this means that I have to uninstall my
current R and reinstall the latest version - but before I go through all
that can anyone confirm that that is indeed what I need to do or is there
some other problem?

Thanks Nick Wray

Sorry -- I am too ignorant to answer your query.

But, just curious: Is there a good reason why you would *not* want to
install the latest version of R and your packages?

Cheers,
Bert

This often indicates you need to restart R.

Subject: [R] Extracting data using subset function
Message-ID: <CAEezrQRWrA4VEFxH7rbq0LT3=buT030pfi15UQ7X7i1VCFyoDw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I want to create a vector p and extract first 20 observations using subset
function based on logical condition.

My code is below

p <- 0:100

I know i can extract the first 20 observations using the following command.

q <- p[1:20]

But I want to extract the first 20 observations using subset function which
requires a logical condition. I am not able to frame the logical condition.

The code should be

q <- subset(p, logical condition)

I am not able to do it. Please let me know what you think.

Best regards,
Upananda

Do you mean something like the following?  Here the first elements are
selected by subset function.

Thank you. It means we can not use the subset function here.

No, it means what it says: it is best used interactively rather than in functions. That is not saying you cannot use it... merely that you should probably use it interactively.

The fact is, though, that integer indexing is much simpler and clearer for your particular example than subset is.

q <- p[1:20]
q2 <- subset( p, 1:100 <= 20) # 1:100 are positions

I think that you are manufacturing an unnecessary difficulty.  If you
want the first 20 entries of p, use p[1:20]!!!

However, if you obdurately *insist* on using subset() you could do

    subset(p,(1:length(p)) <= 20)

This works, but makes a mountain out of a molehill.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

Hi Jeff,

Thanks for your reply. What do you exactly mean by "interactively"?  Would
you please give me an example?

Just to build the mountain a little higher, I would use

   subset(p, seq_along(p) <= 20)

You should generally avoid expressions like "1:length(p)", because they 
don't do what you would expect in the unusual case that p is length 0.

Even in cases where you know p is not length 0, it's a good habit to get 
into so that in the future you don't get surprised.

I will not (re-)define the basic terms used in describing how R is used... do read [1] for that.

[1] https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#Writing-your-own-functions, also via RShowDoc("R-intro"), in particular contrast section 1.5 vs section 10.

A major question is why you ask how to use the subset function rather than asking how to get your job done.

As you note, the simple way to get the first N items is to use indexing. If you absolutely positively insist on using subset, place your data into something like a data.frame and add a column and use that.

Say you have N items, so that length() or nrow() return N. You can add a column called index whose entries are 1:N and do your subset to get all rows where the condition is "index <= N" or something like that. 

If you want just the first N (not N at a time in several tries) simply used head(data, N) and that gets you the first N.

And if you are interested in learning other packages like dplyr in the tidyverse, it has oodles of ways to select based on row numbers. One example is top_n(...) and another is slice(first, last)  and in some contexts such as the filter() function, there is a sort of internal function you can use called n() that contains the index of the entry within any grouping so filter(mydata, n() <= 20) might get what you want.

Note that the above requires care as some things work on vectors and others assume a data.frame, albeit you can make a data.frame containing a single vector.

Thank you. It means we can not use the subset function here.

Hi Upananda,
As a couple of respondents noted, you only need the logical statement,
not subset().

You did "frame the logical condition" in your example, for if you use
the extraction operator "[" this will work:
subset(p,(1:length(p)) <= 20)
as Jeff already pointed out. Obviously it is easier to write:
p[(1:length(p)) <= 20]

Let's say you want to select the odd numbers in p:
p<-1:10
as.logical(p%%2)
[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE
p[as.logical(p%%2)]
[1] 1 3 5 7 9
The as.logical() has to be included as the extractor function tries
use integers as indices

So the problem is really to reduce your selection criteria to a vector
of TRUER/FALSE values.

I tend not to teach subset() as indexing is needed anyway and hence 
subset() is just an extra level of cpmplexity that is not needed.
Also note what ?subset warns about.

Hello,

Yes you can:


subset(p, p %in% 1:20)
# [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

Hello,

But a much more natural the *first* n observations is with function head.


head(p, n = 20)
# [1]  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19


Hope this helps,

Aaarrrggghhh.  That was a dumb-dumb on my part.  As Burns said to
Ripley (fortunes::fortune(26)), good catch.

Thanks.

In reading the post again, it sounds like the question is how to create a logical condition that translates as 1:N is TRUE. Someone hinted along those lines. 

So one WAY I might suggest is you construct a logical vector as shown below. I give an example of a bunch of 9 primes and you want only the first 5.

> vec <- c(1,2,3,5,7,11,13,17, 19)
> length(vec)
[1] 9
> N <- 5
> choose <- rep(TRUE, N)
> choose
[1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
> subset(vec, choose)        # will fail as the remaining are recycled or assumed to be true
[1]  1  2  3  5  7 11 13 17 19
> tot = length(vec)
> choose <- c(rep(TRUE, N), rep(FALSE, tot - N))
> choose
[1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
> subset(vec, choose)
[1] 1 2 3 5 7

The end shows you need to create N Boolean TRUE values and tot-N FALSE to make a vector of the same length as the first so everything is indexed.

Does something like this meet your needs?

Realistically, the above technique generalizes to more complex cases decently. But sometimes, head(0 and other things I mentioned earlier work quite well.

Hi Avi,

Thanks a lot. This worked well.

My sincere gratitude to you for teaching me. I am also grateful to
previous forum contributors, who have given me the various dimensions to
think and solve the problem. It has really helped to enhance my
understanding of subsetting function.

Thank you once again to all of you.

Regards,
Upananda Pani

It is not possible, apply() converts its argument to an array. You might be
able to use split() and lapply() to solve your problem.

Hello,

The last form,


apply(mydf[,c("x", "y")], 1, function(row) {row["x"] + row["y"]})


is the right one. If your data has columns of a mix of classes, then the 
rows which are vectors are coerced to the greatest common denominator 
class.
 From ?c:


Details
The output type is determined from the highest type of the components in 
the hierarchy NULL < raw < logical < integer < double < complex < 
character < list < expression.



Also, since you have a data.frame the following is another possible way:


apply(mydf[c("x", "y")], 1, function(row) {row["x"] + row["y"]})


This doesn't work with matrices.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Hi Naresh

If you wanted to automate the function a bit you can use sapply to find
numeric columns
ind <- sapply(mydf, is.numeric)

and use it in apply construct
apply(mydf[,ind], 1, function(row) sum(row))
 [1]  2.13002569  0.63305300  1.48420429  0.13523859  1.17515873 -0.98531131
 [7]  0.47044467  0.23914494  0.26504430  0.02037657

Cheers
Petr

Thanks for all the responses.  I need to use some text columns to determine method applied to numeric columns. 

Split seems to be the way to go.

Subject: [R] overlaying two graphs / plots /lines
Message-ID: <CA+JEM03Pom9Y6vRLzrfNp=P-e4uonr1CN2eLAdpgHTdNgpNwTg@mail.gmail.com>

 Dear all,

Any suggestions on how I could overlay two or more graphs / plots / lines
that have different sizes and the x axes have different breakpoints.

One dataframe is : A :

on x axis : 1 , 7, 9, 20, etc ... (100 elements)
on y axis : 39, 91, 100, 3, etc ... (100 elements)


The other dataframe is : B :

on x axis : 10, 21, 67, 99, 200 etc .. (200 elements).
on y axis :  9, 0, 89, 1000, 90, 1001. ... (200 elements).

Thanks a lot,

Bogdan

Hi Bogdan,
Try this:

A<-data.frame(x=c(1,7,9,20),
 y=c(39,91,100,3))
B<-data.frame(x=c(10,21,67,99,200),
 y=c(9,89,1000,90,1001)) # one value omitted to equalize the rows
xrange<-range(c(unlist(A$x),unlist(B$x)))
yrange<-range(c(unlist(A$y),unlist(B$y)))
plot(A,type="l",xlim=xrange,ylim=yrange,col="red")
lines(B,lty=2,col="blue")
legend(150,400,c("A","B"),lty=1:2,col=c("red","blue"))

There are other tricks to deal with the differences in range between A and B.

Jim

Hello,

Here is a ggplot way.
I'll use the same data.

On each data.frame, create an id column, saying which df it is.


A<-data.frame(x=c(1,7,9,20),
               y=c(39,91,100,3))
B<-data.frame(x=c(10,21,67,99,200),
               y=c(9,89,1000,90,1001)) # one value omitted to equalize 
the rows

suppressPackageStartupMessages({
   library(dplyr)
   library(ggplot2)
})

bind_rows(
   A %>% mutate(id = "A"),
   B %>% mutate(id = "B")
)
#>     x    y id
#> 1   1   39  A
#> 2   7   91  A
#> 3   9  100  A
#> 4  20    3  A
#> 5  10    9  B
#> 6  21   89  B
#> 7  67 1000  B
#> 8  99   90  B
#> 9 200 1001  B


To do this in a pipe doesn't change the original data.
Then pipe the result to ggplot separating the lines by mapping id to 
color. ggplot will automatically take care of the axis ranges.


bind_rows(
   A %>% mutate(id = "A"),
   B %>% mutate(id = "B")
) %>%
   ggplot(aes(x, y, colour = id)) +
   geom_line() +
   theme_bw()


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

What are you trying to do? Why use apply when there is already a vector addition operation?
df$x+df$y or as.numeric(df$x)+as.numeric(df$y) or rowSums(as.numeric(df[c('x','y')])).

As noted in other answers, apply will coerce your data frame to a matrix, and all entries of a matrix must have the same type.

Regards,
Jorgen Harmse.

Dear all,

I do have dataframes with numerical values such as 1,9, 20, 51, 100 etc

Which way do you recommend to use in order to identify the type of the
distribution of the data (normal, poisson, bernoulli, exponential,
log-normal etc ..)

Thanks so much,

Bogdan

1. This is a statistical question, which usually is inappropriate here:
this list is about R language (including packages) programming.

2. IMO (so others may disagree), your question indicates a profound
misunderstanding of basic statistical issues. While maybe you phrased it
poorly or I misunderstand, but "identify the type of distribution" is
basically a meaningless query. Explaining why this is so and what may be
more meaningful would require a deep dive into statistics. You might try
referencing a basic statistical text and/or online tutorials. Try searching
on "Goodness of fit", "statistical modeling" or the like.

Cheers,
Bert

IMO) The best approach is to develop a good understanding of the individual processes that resulted in the observed values. The blend of those processes then results in the distribution of the observed values. This is seldom done, and often not possible to do. The alternatives depend on why you are doing this. 

0) Sometime the nature of the data suggest a distribution. You list integer values. If all observations are integer (counts for example) then Poisson may be appropriate. With two values then maybe the Binomial distribution. Continuous data might be normally distributed (Gaussian distribution). If I roll one six-sided die many times I will have a uniform distribution (assuming a fair die). I could then try the same task but roll 2 dice and add the result. I still have discrete values, but the shape is closer to Gaussian. The distribution looks more and more Gaussian as I add more dice together in each roll. 
 
1) Try a simulation. Draw 5 values from a normal distribution, make a histogram. Then do it again. Is it easy to see that both samples are from the same distribution? Personally, the answer is no. So increase the sample size until you are happy with a decision that any two draws are from the same distribution. For my part, at 1 million most people would not be able to detect any difference between the two histograms. This helps calibrate the people. How does your sample size compare to your choice in this exercise?

2) Given that you have sufficient data (see above), can you see the distribution in your data? Is that good enough?

3) Are you doing this as part of following the assumptions of statistical models? In such tests for normality, we tend to assume that a failure to reject the null hypothesis is sufficient proof that the null hypothesis is true. However, in most other cases we are told that a failure to reject the null hypothesis is not sufficient to prove the null hypothesis. You need to work this out, but the importance, consequences, and alternatives of testing model assumptions is a large body of literature with (sometimes) widely divergent viewpoints. 

4) There are hundreds of distributions. https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Distributions.html but the common distributions are seen in sites like this one:  https://www.stat.umn.edu/geyer/old/5101/rlook.html. Given so many choices, you can probably find one that will fit your data reasonably well. Depending on how many data points you have will determine the reliability of that answer. Is that really informative to the problem you are trying to solve? Answering "what distribution do these data follow?" is not usually the goal.

1. This is a statistical question, which usually is inappropriate here:
this list is about R language (including packages) programming.

2. IMO (so others may disagree), your question indicates a profound misunderstanding of basic statistical issues. While maybe you phrased it poorly or I misunderstand, but "identify the type of distribution" is basically a meaningless query. Explaining why this is so and what may be more meaningful would require a deep dive into statistics. You might try referencing a basic statistical text and/or online tutorials. Try searching on "Goodness of fit", "statistical modeling" or the like.

	  I concur:  The application will often suggest a distribution, e.g., 
Poisson, binomial or negative binomial for nonnegative integers, Weibull 
for lifetime data, etc.


	  I love normal probability plots -- the qqnorm function.  This can 
identify outliers or multimodality or the need for a transformation. 
Continuous data that are always positive are often log-normal -- or a 
mixture of log-normals.


x <- rnorm(100)
X <- exp(x)
qqnorm(X, datax=TRUE, log='x')


	  The central limit theorem says that the distribution of almost any 
sum of random variables will be more nearly normal than the 
distributions of individual summands.  It also says that almost any 
product of positive random variables will be more nearly log-normal than 
the distributions of individual components of the product.  This 
application to products is less well known and occasionally controversial.

Naresh,

This is a common case where the answer to a question is to ask the right question.

Your question was how to make apply work. My question is how can you get the functionality you want done in some version of R.

Apply is a tool and it is only one of many tools and may be the wrong one for your task. 

For a data.frame there can be lots of tools you may investigate both in vase R and add-on packages like dplyr in the tidyverse.

As has been pointed out, a side-effect of apply is to make a matrix and R automagically figures out what the most specific kind of data type it can handle.

So solutions range from not including any columns that are not numeric, if that makes sense, to accepting they are all going to be of type character and in the function you apply, convert them individually back to what you want.

One straightforward solution is to make a loop indexed to the number of rows in your data.frame and process the variables in each row using [] notation. Not fast, but you see what you have. 

Another is functions like pmap() in the purr package. Yet another might be the rowwise() function in the dplyr package.

It depends on what you want to do. Note with multiple columns, sometimes your function may need to use a ... to receive them.

Thanks for all the responses.  I need to use some text columns to determine method applied to numeric columns. 

Split seems to be the way to go.

Jorgen is correct that for many purposes, viewing a data.frame as a
collection of vectors of the same length allows you to code fairly complex
logic using whichever vectors you want and result in a vector answer, either
externally or as a new column. Text columns used to make some decisions in
the function are also usable using vectorized functions like ifelse(cond,
when_true, when_false).

And, although much can be done in base R, people often use the
dplyr/tidyverse function of mutate() to do such calculations in a slightly
less wordy way.

You may be looking at apply() as a way to operate one row at a time when an
R paradigm is to be able to operate on all rows sort of at once.

What are you trying to do? Why use apply when there is already a vector
addition operation?
df$x+df$y or as.numeric(df$x)+as.numeric(df$y) or
rowSums(as.numeric(df[c('x','y')])).

As noted in other answers, apply will coerce your data frame to a matrix,
and all entries of a matrix must have the same type.

Hi

Others gave you more fundamental answers. To check the possible distribution
you could use package

It's easy enough to do this,
the question is "what does it MEAN?"
If you overlay two graphs, what comparisons will
people naturally make, and what do
you want them to make?
What transformations on the x axis would make
two vertically aligned points about the "same" thing?
What transformations on the y axis would make
a vertical displacement of 1cm equally important
for the two frames?
This *semantic* alignment of the tables is too
important to leave up to some blind algorithm.

fitdistrplus is a great package.
But the documentation for the fitdist function makes
something very clear:
  fitdistr(data, distr, ...)
    distr [is] A character string "name" naming a distribution
          for which the corresponding density function dname,
          the corresponding distribution function pname and the
          corresponding quantile function qname must be defined,
          or directly the density function.

That is, it fits the *parameters* of a distribution,
it does not infer the *form* of the distribution.
If you tell it 'distr = "norm"' it will fit a mean and
standard deviation.  It will not pick distr = "norm" by
itself, which is what I think the OP wanted.

descdist from that package will *help*, but its advice
is not infallible, and it considers a limited range of
distributions.  (It doesn't deal with circular ones,
for example.)

Dear R-experts,

I am trying to fit a GAM with 2 binary predictors (variables coded 0,1). I guess I cannot just smooth binary variables. By the way I code them as 0=no,1=yes, then mgcv will think those variables are numeric.?
I have tried to change 0 and 1 in no and yes. It does not work.
How to solve my problem. Here below my toy example. Many thanks.

Best,

Subject: [R] latticeExtra: how to use doubleYScale when we want to keep the
 groups of every lattice graph
Message-ID: <54eae433-0fc5-93cc-4728-08ab86603120@free.fr>

Dear R-Help-list,

 ?I want to use the doubleYScale function from latticeExtra to overlap two
lattice graphs (cf. code below). The overlapping works but I lose the 
groups of
every lattice, there are only two colors. Reading the documentation,
the arguments style1 and style2 give me the impression that it is not
possible to keep the groups of every lattice.

Is there any possibility to keep the groups of every lattice graph with 
the doubleYScale function ?

Or, might you give me some orientations to realize the graph keeping the 
groups using the lattice package ?

Thank you

Best regards

Laurent

In the line suggested by Andrew Simmons,

mydata <- mydata[, !grepl("^yr", colnames(mydata)), drop = FALSE]

what does drop=FALSE do? Thanks.

drop = FALSE means that should the indexing select exactly one column, then
return a data frame with one column, instead of the object in the column.
It's usually not necessary, but I've messed up some data before by assuming
the indexing always returns a data frame when it doesn't, so drop = FALSE
let's me that I will always get a data frame.

```
x <- data.frame(V1 = 1:5, V2 = letters[1:5])
x[, "V2"]
x[, "V2", drop = FALSE]
```

You'll notice that the first returns a character vector, a through e, where
the second returns a data frame with one column where the object in the
column is the same character vector.

You could alternatively use

x["V2"]

which should be identical to x[, "V2", drop = FALSE], but some people don't
like that because it doesn't look like matrix indexing anymore.

x["V2"]

is more efficient than using drop=FALSE, and perfectly normal syntax (data frames are lists of columns).  I would ignore the naysayers, or put a comment in if you want to accelerate their uptake.

As I understand it, one of the main reasons tibbles exist is because of drop=TRUE. List-slice (single-dimension) indexing works equally well with both standard and tibble types of data frames.

Thanks Jeff and Andrew. My initial file, mydata, is a data frame with 92 
columns (variables). After the operation (trimming), it remains a data 
frame with 72 variables. So yes indeed, I do not need the drop=FALSE.

<SNIP>

I never cease to be amazed by the sagacity and perspicacity of the
designers of R.  I  would have worried that x["V2"] would turn out to be
a *list* (of length 1), but no, it retains the data.frame class, which
is clearly the Right Thing To Do.

cheers,

Rolf

x[?V2?] would retain columns of x headed by V2. What I need is the opposite??I need a data grime with those columns excluded.

Complain, complain...

x[ names( x ) != "V2" ]

or

x[ ! names( x ) %in% c( "V2", "V3" ) ]

or any other character or logical or integer expression that selects columns you want...

What I meant is that that

mydata[, !grepl("^yr", colnames(mydata)), drop = FALSE]

and

mydata[!grepl("^yr", colnames(mydata))]

should be identical. Some people would prefer the first because the
indexing looks the same as matrix indexing, whereas some people would
prefer the second because it is more efficient. However, I would argue
it is exactly as efficient. You can see from the first few lines of
`[.data.frame` when the first index is missing and the second is
provided, it does almost the same thing as if only the first index
provided.

Steven,

The default is drop=TRUE.

If you want to retain a data.frame and not have it reduced to a vector under some circumstances.

In the line suggested by Andrew Simmons,

mydata <- mydata[, !grepl("^yr", colnames(mydata)), drop = FALSE]

what does drop=FALSE do? Thanks.

Subject: [R] sparseMatrix image not working in for loop
Message-ID: <33427787-2ae8-daa0-9933-5a0bb449c36f@ngs.gen-info.osaka-u.ac.jp>

Hi all,

I have just encountered a weird behavior of image(sparseMatrix) when 
trying to output plots to files in a for loop.

A sample code is provided below at the end of this mail as well as in 
the attachment. In the code, calling image(sparseMatrix) works outside 
of a for loop - the image file is written. Calling 
image(as.matrix(sparseMatrix)) also works inside a for loop thus 
eliminating file access problem. However when using image(sparseMatrix) 
inside for loop, no image file is produced, nor is there any error message.

The execution environment is on 2 different distributions of Linux 
running R 3.6.3 and 4.2.1, Matrix library 1.2-18 and 1.5-3 respectively, 
and all showing the same behavior.

Can anyone point me a direction on where to look for?

Sincerely,

Shunran Zhang

--- Sample code ---

# Initialize dataset library(Matrix) set.seed(0) filler <- 
list(sample(1:1000,1000), sample(1:1000,1000), runif(1000,0,100)) 
sampledata <- sparseMatrix(i = filler[[1]], j = filler[[2]], x = 
filler[[3]], dims = c(1000,1000)) # Works: image on a sparse matrix 
outside for loop item <- "a" png(paste("img/out_of_for_",item,".png", 
sep = "", collapse = ""), width = 1000, height = 1000) image(sampledata) 
dev.off() remove(item) for(item in c("a")){ ?# Does not work: image on a 
sparse matrix inside for loop ?png(paste("img/in_for_img_",item,".png", 
sep = "", collapse = ""), width = 1000, height = 1000) 
 ?image(sampledata) ?dev.off() ?# Works: image on a dense matrix inside 
for loop ?png(paste("img/in_for_hist_",item,".png", sep = "", collapse = 
""), width = 1000, height = 1000) ?image(as.matrix(sampledata)) 
 ?dev.off() }

image() methods for Matrix objects use lattice graphics: they
internally call levelplot(). Lattice graphics don't directly draw their
plots; instead, they return objects of class "trellis" whose
print.trellis method actually performs the drawing. (The same thing
happens with ggplot2 graphics.)

You can use plot(image(...)) or print(image(...)) to force the plot to
be rendered even when there's no auto-printing (such as when you're
inside a for loop).

Ivan

I'm mostly guessing from looking at the examples, but is this what you want?

gr_Gx_Tx <- latticeExtra::doubleYScale(gr_Gx, gr_Tx, style1 = 0, style2 = 0)
