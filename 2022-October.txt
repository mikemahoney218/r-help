Those are valid reasons as examining data and cleaning or fixing it is a
major thing to do before making an analysis or plots. Indeed, an extra
column caused by something in an earlier column mat have messed up all
columns to the right.

My point was about replicating a problem like this may require many more
lines from the file.

Subject: [R] could not find function "flexsurvreg"
Message-ID: <CA+bivFj5M5HeVawxZXeZ4S9JgZUAY2eF8DCUb_JXyNiNoLk59A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,
I am analyzing trial data for survival. During the loading of the R package
"flexsurv", the following error message appeared.

"Loading required package: survival
Error: package or namespace load failed for ?flexsurv? in loadNamespace(j
<- i[[1L]], c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[j]]):
 there is no package called ?lifecycle?

Despite installing lifecycle package, loading lifecycle package results in
the following error message:

Error in library(lifecycle) : there is no package called ?lifecycle?

Moreover, the flexsurvreg function in the flexsurv library also produces an
error:

Error in flexsurvreg(Surv(Time, Event) ~ 1, anc = NULL, data = data1,  :
  could not find function "flexsurvreg"

Several times I have installed and uninstalled packages, re-started R, but
the error persists.

Could anyone help me with the flexsurv package, why is it not working?

Best regards,
Shah

Hello,

Not knowing which system you have, here is a way that usually works.

1. If you are using an IDE sych as RStudio or RGui, save your work and 
exit. This is because when the packages' namepaces are loaded, the 
shared libs, if they exist, are blocked,

2. Open a terminal window
3. Run

R -q -e "install.packages(c('lifecycle', 'flexsurv'))"


The packages should now be installed.


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Subject: [R] Help with steam graph
Message-ID: <CAFy_oHAn0RGPVXG=ypbxHM_idX08=c94QOh+gpqwXVEEKYnuSw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, i'm trying to create a steamgraph with the following data by creating a
unit indicator by combing the year and month. But, I'm getting error as :

Error in `group_by()`:
! Must group by variables found in `.data`.
? Column `com_num` is not found.
Run `rlang::last_error()` to see where the error occurred.

### Packages needed for the code
devtools::install_github("hrbrmstr/streamgraph")

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(steamgraph)

### Code ( The following code can be found on creator's account
https://hrbrmstr.github.io/streamgraph/  )

dat %>%
select(year, month, company, share, com_num) %>%
  tidyr::gather(company, share, -year) %>%
  group_by(year, com_num) %>%
  tally(wt=share) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  streamgraph("com_num", "n", "year") %>%
  sg_axis_x(0.8) %>%
  sg_fill_brewer("PuOr") %>%
  sg_legend(show=TRUE, label="Share: ")


### data is like the following

dput(dat)

Subject: [R] Robust standard error
Message-ID: <CAPkN0fY32F=b=RFsTuCnDytg4i=++CkB_Bw7VLN+i=0rvaBQtQ@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a way to estimate Robust standard errors when using a nls()
function? I'm trying to fit some data to a complicated model and everything
works fine with nls() but I also wanted to obtain a robust estimate of my
errors.

I tried "coeftest(m, vcov=sandwich)" and it seems to work, but so does
"coeftest(m, vcov = NeweyWest(m, lag = 4))" or "coeftest(m, vcov =
kernHAC(m, kernel = "Bartlett", bw = 5, prewhite = FALSE, adjust =
FALSE))". They return different error estimates so I wanted you to help me
understand what I should do, if I'm doing something wrong and other stuff.

Thank you

I don?t see a column with the name ?com_num?, so the error message makes complete sense.

You may get a helpful response here, but generally speaking, this list is
about R **programming**, and statistical issues/tutorials are off topic.

Actually in my main data the column name is com_num ( where mistakenly I
pasted the sample data here under the com_name ). So, when I run the
command successfully this is the error shows up -

    ?
  1. ??... %>% sg_legend(show = TRUE, label = "Share: ")
  2. ??streamgraph::sg_legend(., show = TRUE, label = "Share: ")
  3. ??streamgraph::sg_fill_brewer(., "PuOr")
  4. ??streamgraph::sg_axis_x(., 0.8)
  5. ??streamgraph::streamgraph(., "com_num", "n", "year")
  6. ? ??base::data.frame(data)
  7. ??dplyr::ungroup(.)
  8. ??dplyr::tally(., wt = share)
  9. ??dplyr::group_by(., year, com_num)
 10. ??dplyr:::group_by.data.frame(., year, com_num)
 11.   ??dplyr::group_by_prepare(.data, ..., .add = .add, caller_env =
caller_env())
 12.     ??rlang::abort(bullets, call = error_call)

Any suggestions on how I can fix it ??

Most computer code will take a pile of numbers and return a pile of numbers. Reading the documentation should help you figure out where each measure is appropriate. It all depends on the purpose of a specific method and its assumptions and how those relate to your data, application, and model assumptions. It is important to know that information because it could change if you change your model or find other questions to ask of your data. There is no universal right answer.

Subject: [R] Creating a year-month indicator and groupby with category
Message-ID: <CAFy_oHDGR7cnNwcTW3mNknKvHhRz+LC4v4XSeKrKEOUjMTcsmA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have the following data. I want to show in a line plot how each different
company is earning over the timeline of my data sample.

I'm not sure how I can create the *year-month indicator* to plot it nicely
in my horizontal axis out of my dataset.

After creating the *year-month* indicator ( which will be in my x axis) I
want to create a dataframe where I can groupby companies over the
year-month indicator by putting *share *in the y axis as variables.

### data is like the following

dput(dat)
structure(list(year = c(2018, 2019, 2019, 2019, 2019, 2019, 2019,
2019, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017,
2017, 2017, 2018, 2018, 2018, 2018, 2018, 2018, 2018, 2018, 2018,
2018, 2018, 2018, 2019, 2019, 2019, 2019, 2019), month = c(12,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), company = c("ABC",
"ABC", "ABC", "ABC", "ABC", "ABC", "ABC", "ABC", "FGH", "FGH",
"FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH",

53, 53, 54, 53, 58, 54, 50, 47, 55, 50, 52, 51, 51.5, 52, 53,

2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)), row.names = c(NA,
-37L), spec = structure(list(cols = list(year = structure(list(), class =
c("collector_double",
"collector")), month = structure(list(), class = c("collector_double",
"collector")), company = structure(list(), class = c("collector_character",
"collector")), share = structure(list(), class = c("collector_double",
"collector")), com_name = structure(list(), class = c("collector_double",
"collector"))), default = structure(list(), class = c("collector_guess",
"collector")), delim = ","), class = "col_spec"), problems = <pointer:
0x7fd732028680>, class = c("spec_tbl_df",

I think you are being dishonest. That code does not appear on hrbrmstr's 
vignette at least in a form that I recognize.

When I run your code from the first posting with all the instances of 
`com_num` replaced by `com_name` and removing the `pointer` entry in dat 
which throws an error when trying to define dat, I get

Error in `group_by()`: ! Must group by variables found in `.data`. ? 
Column `com_name` is not found. So I "rewind the process to the point 
where the error is reported and find

> dat %>%+ select(year, month, company, share, com_name) %>% + 
tidyr::gather(company, share, -year) # A tibble: 148 ? 3 year company 
share <dbl> <chr> <chr> 1 2018 month 12 2 2019 month 1 3 2019 month 2 4 
2019 month 3 5 2019 month 4 6 2019 month 5 7 2019 month 6 8 2019 month 7 
9 2017 month 1 10 2017 month 2 # ? with 138 more rows # ? Use `print(n = 
...)` to see more rows So the "gathering" process seems to have removed 
the `com_name` column. Can exit R without saving your workspace and then 
construct a series of R commands that will create a reproducible 
example? -- David.

Subject: [R] [External Help] Multivariate Polynomials in R
Message-ID: <b3d455f8-4446-6417-cc1e-b746842bc78e@syonic.eu>

Dear R Users,

I have written some R code for multivariate polynomials in R. I am 
looking forward for some help in redesigning and improving the code.

Although this code was not planned initially to be released as a 
package, the functionality has become quite versatile over time. I will 
provide some examples below. If anyone is interested in multivariate 
polynomials and has some spare time, or has some students interested to 
learn some interesting math, feel free to contact me.

The immediate focus should be on:
1) Writing/improving the automatic tests;
2) Redesigning the code (and build an R package);

As the code has grown in size, I am very cautious to change anything, 
until proper tests are written. I have started to write some test code 
(the link to the GitHub page is below), but I am not yet very confident 
how to properly write the tests and also lack the time as well. I will 
appreciate any expertise and help on this topic.

Ultimately, I hope to be able to focus more on the math topics. I will 
post a separate call for some of these topics.

CODE DETAILS

The source files are on GitHub:
https://github.com/discoleo/R/blob/master/Math/Polynomials.Helper.R
- (all) files named Polynomials.Helper.XXX.R are needed; (~ 25 files, 
including the test files);
- if requested, I can also upload a zip file with all these source files;
- the code started as some helper scripts (which is why all those files 
are mixed with other files);

The multivariate polynomials are stored as data.frames and R's 
aggregate() function is the workhorse: but it proved sufficiently fast 
and the code works well even with polynomials with > 10,000 monomials. I 
have some older Java code which used a TreeMap (sorted map), but I do 
not maintain that code anymore. I was very reserved initially regarding 
the efficiency of the data frame; but it worked well! And it proved very 
useful for sub-setting specific monomials!

I have attached some concrete examples below.

Sincerely,

Leonard


### Examples

source("Polynomials.Helper.R")
# - requires also the other Helper scripts;
# - not strictly needed (but are loaded automatically):
#?? library(polynom)
#?? library(pracma)

### Example 1:
n = 2; # Power "n" will be evaluated automatically
p1 = toPoly.pm("x^n*y + b*z - R")
p2 = toPoly.pm("y^n*z + b*x - R")
p3 = toPoly.pm("z^n*x + b*y - R")

pR = solve.lpm(p1, p2, p3, xn=c("z", "y"))
str(pR) # 124 monomials
# tweaking manually can improve the results;
pR = solve.lpm(p1, p2, p3, xn=c("y", "z"))
str(pR)
# pR[[2]]$Rez: 19 monomials: much better;

pR2 = div.pm(pR[[2]]$Rez, "x^3 + b*x - R", "x")
# Divisible!
str(pR2)
# Order 12 polynomial in x (24 monomials);

### Note:
# - the P[12] contains the distinct roots:
#?? it is the minimal order polynomial;
# - the trivial solution (x^3 + b*x = R) was removed;
# - this is the naive way to solve this system (but good as Demo);

# print the coefficients of x;
# (will be used inside the function coeff.S3Ht below)
pR2 = pR2$Rez;
pR2$coeff = - pR2$coeff; # positive leading coeff;
toCoeff(pR2, "x")

### Quick Check
solve.S3Ht = function(R, b) {
 ?? ?coeff = coeff.S3Ht(R, b);
 ?? ?x = roots(coeff); # library(pracma)
 ?? ?# Note: pracma uses leading to free coeff;
 ?? ?z = b*x^11 - R*x^10 - 2*R^2*b*x^5 + 2*R^2*b^2*x^3 + R*b^4*x^2 - R*b^5;
 ?? ?z = z / (- R^2*x^6 - R*b^2*x^5 + 3*R*b^3*x^3 - b^6);
 ?? ?y = (R - z^2*x) / b;
 ?? ?sol = cbind(x, y, z);
 ?? ?return(sol);
}
coeff.S3Ht = function(R, b) {
 ?? ?coeff = c(b^2, - 2*R*b, R^2 - b^3, 3*R*b^2,
 ?? ???? - 3*R^2*b + b^4, R^3 - 4*R*b^3,
 ?? ???? 2*R^2*b^2 - b^5, 5*R*b^4,
 ?? ???? R^4 - R^2*b^3 + b^6, - 3*R^3*b^2 - 3*R*b^5,
 ?? ???? - R^4*b + 3*R^2*b^4 - b^7,
 ?? ???? 2*R^3*b^3 - R*b^6,
 ?? ???? - R^2*b^5 + b^8);
 ?? ?return(coeff);
}

R = 5; b = -2;
sol = solve.S3Ht(R, b)
# all 12 sets of solutions:
x = sol[,1]; y = sol[,2]; z = sol[,3];

### Test:
x^2*y + b*z
y^2*z + b*x
z^2*x + b*y

id = 1;
eval.pm(p1, list(x=x[id], y=y[id], z=z[id], b=b, R=R))


##############

### Example 2:

n = 5
p1 = toPoly.pm("(x + a)^n + (y + a)^n - R1")
p2 = toPoly.pm("(x + b)*(y + b) - R2")

# Very Naive way to solve:
pR = solve.pm(p1, p2, "y")
str(pR)
table(pR$Rez$x)
# Order 10 with 109 monomials;
# [very naive!]

Hello,

First of all, I'll repost the data at end because the OP posted with a 
pointer ref:

problems = <pointer: 0x7fd732028680>

and this must be removed for the dput output to run.
Suggestion: coerce to class "data.frame" and post the output of


dput(as.data.frame(dat))


Now the plot.
Here are two plots of share by date, grouped by company. One with base R 
graphics and the other one with package ggplot2.

Create a date/time column to be used by both plots.


dat$date <- with(dat, ISOdate(year, month, 1))


1) Base R plot.


ylim <- range(dat$share) + c(0, 2)  # make room for the legend on top
comp <- unique(dat$company)         # draw each line in a loop on companies

# open a blank plot witth all the data,
# setting the ylim as explained above
plot(share ~ date, dat, type = "n", ylim = ylim)
for(i in seq_along(comp)) {
   lines(share ~ date, subset(dat, company == comp[i]), col = i)
}
legend("top", legend = comp, col = seq_along(comp), lty = "solid", horiz 
= TRUE)


2) ggplot2 plot.


library(ggplot2)

ggplot(dat, aes(date, share, color = company)) +
   geom_line() +
   scale_x_datetime(date_labels = "%Y-%m") +
   scale_color_manual(values = c(ABC = "black", FGH = "red")) +
   theme_bw()


3) The data, reposted with the new pipe operator introduced in R 4.1.0 
to make it look modern and slightly edited.


dat |> as.data.frame() |> dput()

Hi Tariq,
There were a couple of glitches in your data structure. Here's an
example of a simple plot:

dat<-structure(list(year = c(2018, 2019, 2019, 2019, 2019, 2019, 2019,
2019, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017, 2017,
2017, 2017, 2018, 2018, 2018, 2018, 2018, 2018, 2018, 2018, 2018,
2018, 2018, 2018, 2019, 2019, 2019, 2019, 2019), month = c(12,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), company = c("ABC",
"ABC", "ABC", "ABC", "ABC", "ABC", "ABC", "ABC", "FGH", "FGH",
"FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH",
"FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH",
"FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH", "FGH"
), share = c(20, 16.5, 15, 15.5, 15.5, 16, 17, 16.5, 61, 55,
53, 53, 54, 53, 58, 54, 50, 47, 55, 50, 52, 51, 51.5, 52, 53,
54, 55, 53, 54, 50, 42, 48, 41, 40, 39, 36.5, 35), com_name = c(1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2,
2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)), row.names = c(NA,
-37L), spec = structure(list(cols = list(year = structure(list(), class =
c("collector_double",
"collector")), month = structure(list(), class = c("collector_double",
"collector")), company = structure(list(), class = c("collector_character",
"collector")), share = structure(list(), class = c("collector_double",
"collector")), com_name = structure(list(), class = c("collector_double",
"collector"))), default = structure(list(), class = c("collector_guess",
"collector")), delim = ","), class = "col_spec"), class = c("spec_tbl_df",
"tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"))
# convert year and month fields to dates about the middle of each month
dat$date<-as.Date(paste(dat$year,dat$month,15,sep="-"),"%Y-%m-%d")
# plot the values for one company
plot(dat$date[dat$company=="ABC"],dat$share[dat$company=="ABC"],
 main="Plot of dat",xlab="Year",ylab="Share",
 xlim=range(dat$date),ylim=range(dat$share),
 type="l",col="red")
# add a line for the other one
lines(dat$date[dat$company=="FGH"],dat$share[dat$company=="FGH"],col="green")
# get the x plot limits as they are date values
xspan<-par("usr")[1:2]
# place a legend about in the middle of the plot
legend(xspan[1]+diff(xspan)*0.3,35,c("ABC","FGH"),lty=1,col=c("red","green"))

There are many more elegant ways to plot something like this.

Hi R team,
I can use rio package to read excel file into R as a list. The excel file content multiple sheets (30 - 40 data sheets). I can convert each data elements into dataframe manually. I have multiple excel files with multiple data sheets. I need to load them into R and do the comparison for same sheet name from difference excel file. My current code is:
 library(rio)? ?setwd ("C:/temp")
filenames <- gsub("\\.xlsx$","", list.files(pattern="\\.xlsx$"))
for(i in filenames){
? assign(i, import_list(paste0(i, ".xlsx", sep="")))
}
file1_dx1? ? ?<-? file1[["dx1"]]

file1_dx2? ? ?<-? file1[["dx2"]]

file1_dx3? ? ?<-? file1[["dx3"]]

file2_dx1? ? ?<-? file1[["dx1"]]

file2_dx2? ? ?<-? file1[["dx2"]]
......

I hope the code can?automatic converting the list (may have 30 - 40 lists) by adding file name (such as: filename_sheetname) and put it in for loop


Thank you,
Kai

Hello,


list2env(file1, envir = .GlobalEnv)


will create data.frames dx1, dx2, etc, in the global environment.
If you really need the names file1_dx1, file1_dx2, etc, you can first 
change the names


names(file1) <- paste("file1", names(file1), sep = "_")


and then run list2env like above.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

 Hi Rui,
list2env(file1, envir = .GlobalEnv) is worked very well. Thank you.

But when?I tried to put the sample code? into for loop. I got error message:
for(i in filenames){
? assign(i, import_list(paste0(i, ".xlsx", sep="")))
? names(i) <- paste(i, names(i), sep = "_")
? list2env(names(i), envir = .GlobalEnv)
}
Error in list2env(names(i), envir = .GlobalEnv) :?? first argument must be a named list

It seems I cannot put names(i) into for loop,?Could you please help me to debug it?
Thank you,Kai    On Monday, October 3, 2022 at 10:14:25 AM PDT, Rui Barradas <ruipbarradas at sapo.pt> wrote:

Hello,

If in each iteration i is a list, try removing the call to names().
Try, in the loop,


list2env(i, envir = .GlobalEnv)


The error message is telling that list2env's first argument must be a 
named list and names(i) is an unnamed vector, it's i that's the named 
list (you even changed its names in the previous instruction).

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

 Hi Rui,
I copied "list2env(i, envir = .GlobalEnv)" to the code, but I got the same error message of "first argument must be a named list". Maybe list2env cannot put in loop? the code works very well outside of for loop.
One more thing, the difference file may have same sheet name. that's why I want to add file name in front of sheet name to avoid overwriting. It still works well outside of loop, but doesn't work in loop. I don't know how to fix the problems.
Thank you,
Kai

Hello,

Here are two more attempts at solving the problem.

1. Instead of having 30-40 data.frames per file in the globalenv, not a 
good idea, the following code will create as many lists as you have 
files and each list is a list of df's.


temp_list <- vector("list", length = length(filenames))
for(i in seq_along(filenames)){
   xlfile <- filenames[i]
   temp_list[[i]] <- import_list(paste0(xlfile, ".xlsx"))
}
list2env(temp_list, envir = .GlobalEnv)
rm(temp_list)

Now you can access the data with code like


file1$dx1       # a data.frame, first sheet in excel file1
file1[["dx1"]]  # equivalent


2. I cannot see a reason why the following shouldn't work. It creates 
lots of data.frames in the globalenv, 30-40 per file. This makes the 
globalenv messy and is not recommended.


temp_list <- vector("list", length = length(filenames))
for(i in seq_along(filenames)){
   # import the data
   xlfile <- filenames[i]
   temp_list[[i]] <- import_list(paste0(xlfile, ".xlsx"))
   # now take care of the names
   new_names <- paste(xlfile, names(temp_list[[i]]), sep = "_")
   names(temp_list[[i]]) <- new_names
   # create the current data.frames in the globalenv
   list2env(temp_list[[i]], envir = .GlobalEnv)
}
rm(temp_list)


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Thanks everyone for being so kind and patient with me throughout the
process! Mr. Barradas and Mr. Lemon, very generous of you for taking the
time and patience to go over my code and data , and taking the time to give
me meaningful feedback!

With your help and suggestion, I was successful in making a graph from my
data. In my main data I have four companies, and just making the graph
process a little more advanced. However after writing the command , I get
the error that I have 4 values but gave only 2 values. Would anyone kindly
guide me what's the mistake and how I can rectify this?

Data is the same. But my main data has 4 companies whereas in R project I
just gave 2 only for convenience.

... But why not dispense with multiple files, name juggling, and
environments by simply putting everything in one list of lists (lists are
recursive structures!):

all_files <- lapply(filenames, function(nm)import_list(nm,...))
names(all_files) <- filenames
## Note: the ... are any optional parameters to import_list() that may be
needed.
## Perhaps none.

all_files will then be a single list, each of whose components is a list of
data frames for all the sheets in the file. I would think that such a list
could easily be accessed and manipulated via list indexing and
*apply-family functions. Just seems like a more straightforward approach to
me (assuming I haven't misunderstood, of course).

 Hello Rui and Bert,
This is a great help! Thank you both!
Here is my job assignment: boss accumulate many years excel reports from same lab. Each report contents multiple data sheets. Those sheets may/may not updated, and some sheets are new. Good news is, the same testing result data will be saved in a data sheet and assign the same sheet name with same fields name, but does not in same file. Boss wants me to get non.duplicate data for difference testing from those excel files. So, I want to load all data into R and assign each data frame name as filename_sheetname. I use the 2nd suggestion from Rui to get this step done! Thanks Rui again. This method save a lot of time for me. Now, I can combine data frames (same _sheetname) together and remove duplicate.
Best,
Kai

Hello,

Here are two more attempts at solving the problem.

1. Instead of having 30-40 data.frames per file in the globalenv, not a 
good idea, the following code will create as many lists as you have 
files and each list is a list of df's.


temp_list <- vector("list", length = length(filenames))
for(i in seq_along(filenames)){
? ?xlfile <- filenames[i]
? ?temp_list[[i]] <- import_list(paste0(xlfile, ".xlsx"))
}
list2env(temp_list, envir = .GlobalEnv)
rm(temp_list)

Now you can access the data with code like


file1$dx1? ? ? ?# a data.frame, first sheet in excel file1
file1[["dx1"]]? # equivalent


2. I cannot see a reason why the following shouldn't work. It creates 
lots of data.frames in the globalenv, 30-40 per file. This makes the 
globalenv messy and is not recommended.


temp_list <- vector("list", length = length(filenames))
for(i in seq_along(filenames)){
? ?# import the data
? ?xlfile <- filenames[i]
? ?temp_list[[i]] <- import_list(paste0(xlfile, ".xlsx"))
? ?# now take care of the names
? ?new_names <- paste(xlfile, names(temp_list[[i]]), sep = "_")
? ?names(temp_list[[i]]) <- new_names
? ?# create the current data.frames in the globalenv
? ?list2env(temp_list[[i]], envir = .GlobalEnv)
}
rm(temp_list)


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Hello,

The error comes from having 2 colors and 4 labels in


scale_colour_manual("", values = c(f_cols[1], m_cols[1]), labels = 
c("F", "M" , "C" , "G"))


You need the same number of colors and labels. For instance, though 
they're probably not the colors you want the following vector has 4 
colors and the plot code doesn't give an error.


values = c(f_cols[1], m_cols[1], f_cols[2], m_cols[2])



Besides, why are you defining 2 colors vectors with 6 colors each if you 
only have 4 companies?

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Subject: [R] Help executing R on High Performance Cluster
Message-ID: <MN2PR04MB6400AA8141307B71683D51F8CB5A9@MN2PR04MB6400.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,

I need some help executing recently downloaded R on my HPC.

Here is the script I used to install R on my HPC module:


wget https://cran.r-project.org/src/base-prerelease/R-devel.tar.gz

tar -xvf R-devel.tar.gz

cd /home/ericrhon/labsoftware/R-devel/

./configure --prefix=/home/ericrhon/labsoftware/R-devel -with-recommended-packages=no --without-x --with-cairo --with-libpng --with-libtiff --with-jpeglib --enable-R-shlib --with-pcre1

make

make install

After I installed, I tried to run /home/ericrhon/labsoftware/R-devel/R. But I get the next error:


/home/ericrhon/labsoftware/R-devel/bin/exec/R: line 272: /home/ericrhon/labsoftware/R-devel/bin/exec/R: Argument list too long

/home/ericrhon/labsoftware/R-devel/bin/exec/R: line 272: /home/ericrhon/labsoftware/R-devel/bin/exec/R: Success

Here is the exec script of R, line 272 is highlighted:

Hi Eric!

I'm not sure, but the reason for the confusing behaviour could be
that the installation prefix is set to be the same as the directory
where you had unpacked the source code. This may have caused file path
conflicts and maybe some kind of recursion when building the final
executable path.

R can run straight from the build directory, without installation.
If you start from scratch, does bin/R work without `make install`? If
not, do you get any useful output if you run bin/R under sh -x?

(Additionally, R supports building away from the source code directory.
For example, if you navigate to the source code directory, then run
mkdir build && cd build && ../configure $CONFIGURE_ARGUMENTS, the build
will be mostly self-contained to that directory, which may be useful
when experimenting.)

Why are you building R with --with-recommended-packages=no?

R is supposed to be easy to build and start working with, but there may
be important details to consider, especially on an HPC, in the "R
installation and administration" guide:
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html

 setting
Message-ID: <344ae947626245a392ebba421f73e483@SRVEXCHCM1302.precheza.cz>

Dear all

After we installed new R version R 4.2.1 installing packages through IE
proxy setting is compromised with warning that R could not connect to server
(tested in vanilla R).

> chooseCRANmirror()
Warning: failed to download mirrors file (cannot open URL
'https://cran.r-project.org/CRAN_mirrors.csv'); using local file
'D:/programy/R/doc/CRAN_mirrors.csv'
Warning message:
In download.file(url, destfile = f, quiet = TRUE) :
  URL 'https://cran.r-project.org/CRAN_mirrors.csv': status was 'Couldn't
connect to server'

So install.packages("whatever") also ends with similar warnings.

When using directly (without proxy need) install.packages works as expected.

In R4.1.0 version it works as expected, without any warnings and packages
could be installed smoothly.

Is it known issue with this version? 
Could it be due to somehow corrupted installation?
Should we set something differently for this new R version

Best regards
Petr

R 4.1 deprecated the use of download.file(method = 'wininet'). R 4.2
switched the default download method to 'libcurl' and started giving
warnings for 'wininet' and http[s]:// URLs.

A workaround to get it working right now would be to set
options(download.file.method = 'wininet') and live with the resulting
warnings while R downloads the files, but a next version of R may
remove 'wininet' support altogether.

In order to get it working with the 'libcurl' method, you'll need to
provide some environment variables to curl:
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2022-September/475917.html

Not sure if libcurl would accept a patch to discover the Windows proxy
settings automatically, but I don't think it does that now.

Hello.
Thank you for helping me.
I am starting my Bioinformatics pathway, and came across a problem im stuck with, even after trying different things:

When in RStudio, I was able to install Git, but SVN remains "not found".
I tried installing SVN through HomeBrew and downloaded Xcode's Command Lines from Apple Developer (as instructed on https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077?version=2022.07.2%2B576&mode=desktop).
After those steps, I restarted R and continue to see "not found" for SVN (git is working fine).
When on mac terminal,

"svn --version" prints

svn, version 1.14.2 (r1899510)

   compiled Oct  3 2022, 21:23:39 on x86_64-apple-darwin21.6.0


"svn info" prints

svn: E155007: '/Users/maisamonseff' is not a working copy

Could you point out what it is I am doing wrong?


Thank you in advance,

... wrong... posting questions about SVN and RStudio in a forum about R? Do read the Posting Guide before posting. There are specialty mailing lists mentioned there that _might_ be relevant, but it seems to me that you need to learn how to use SVN before you learn how to use it with RStudio, and neither of those tools are on their own relevant in any of the R mailing lists.

I don't use a Mac, but I believe you may encounter difficulties using it related to the fact that everything homebrew tools do has permissions restrictions related to homebrew so mixing in non-homebrew tools may not work.

Try perhaps StackOverflow or Reddit?

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73942794/still-getting-error-in-ect-plot-new-has-not-been-called-yet-despite-grouping

Unfortunately, I keep getting the dreaded: Error plot.new has not been called yet

The code is meant to write a PDF containing the ACF and PACF graphs, then do some analyses on the timeseries, and then make a separate PDF containing a plot describing the timeseries based on the p-values of each test for each individual.

}

It will work just fine if I run the lines individually (e.g. set i = 1, 2, ect), and if I comment out abline and title (lines seems to work fine). But it will throw the error everytime I try to run the loop without these commented.

Have tried just about everything I could find on the Stack forums to run everything as a single argument and I'm just not sure what is wrong with it.

dev.list() spits out:

pdf
  2
following the error.

With abline and title commented out and lines run individually it's NULL.

Happens in both RStudio

Subject: [R] Getting "Error in ect,

What you doing or trying to do is far too complex for my poor feeble
and senile brain to come anywhere near comprehending.  The code that
you present exceeds my complexity tolerance by many orders of magnitude.

I have a suggestion, but.  Strip your code down to the *essentials*.
Construct a simple sequence of plotting commands, with *simple* names
for the pdf files involved.  You should require only two or three such
files and two or three index levels associated with each of your
nested loops.

Run the stripped down code and the source of the problem will almost
surely become clear.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

Thanks, 

the workaround works but we need try the "permanent" solution with
Renviron.site file in future.

Your code is still much too complex for my feeble brain.

Without trying to understand very much, I get the impression that the
example is *not* reproducible.  It requires reading in Excel (yeucchh!)
files to which no-one but you has access.

Skip the reading-in completely.  Create toy data using rnorm() instead.
Then someone may be able to help you.

If the problem *didn't* persist, then *that* would have been
unfortunate!  The idea is to reproduce the problem in a simpler context
so that one can deduce what is causing the problem!

There are still (far) too many moving parts, for me anyway.  Someone
cleverer than I might be able to see what the problem is.

Hi,

My hunch is that you need to add print(plout) before you call dev.off().
See https://stackoverflow.com/a/39853861

Try that and let me know if that works. If not, I'll take a closer look
later.

Best,
Josh

Subject: [R] Help installing devtools plus other packages in R terminal
Message-ID: <MN2PR04MB6400967EAC2449BB0F2A528BCB5D9@MN2PR04MB6400.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,

I am using R in my HPC terminal. After many tries, I was able to install and exec successfully R on my HPC but now I cannot install devtools and other dependencies. I need some of theses packages to install some others from bioconductor. I was wondering if anybody has a solution.

The script I got from my R session is (the highlighted part is the errors I keep getting):

> install.packages('devtools')
Installing package into ?/home/ericrhon/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.2?
(as ?lib? is unspecified)

To install the packages from source, you need to install make, gcc, and g++:
?sudo apt install make?
?sudo apt install gcc?
?sudo apt install g++

then try installing them again

Since you have automake installed, you also need libtool
<https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/> installed in order to compile
this particular package from source. Depending on the HPC, there may be
a particular command to "activate" the installation already made by the
HPC administrator.

I guess you could also report this as a bug in devtools: they check for
automake but not libtool. If you can temporarily chmod -x automake, the
installation should succeed too, because then the package will not try
to regenerate its build system. I don't see why they even try to do
that, but maybe that's a workaround for some kind of compatibility
problem.

Make sure your automake installation is working. I think the error is
caused by the previous error and may go away once you install libtool,
but I may be mistaken regarding that.

Do Bioconductor packages really depend on devtools? What do their
errors look like?

Hi Rolf.

I followed your suggestion (though it's probably not as trimmed as it could be), but the problem unfortunately persists.

Does this make it any clearer or still too many moving parts to make sense of?

        External Email - Use Caution

What you doing or trying to do is far too complex for my poor feeble
and senile brain to come anywhere near comprehending.  The code that
you present exceeds my complexity tolerance by many orders of magnitude.

I have a suggestion, but.  Strip your code down to the *essentials*.
Construct a simple sequence of plotting commands, with *simple* names
for the pdf files involved.  You should require only two or three such
files and two or three index levels associated with each of your
nested loops.

Run the stripped down code and the source of the problem will almost
surely become clear.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

Odd. Thought I had attached it.

Would love to go that route, but the problem is a lot of the sub-bits are actually dependent on the values of the timeseries analysis, which has its own dependencies......

Would using the following link to download the excel file help at all?

        External Email - Use Caution


Your code is still much too complex for my feeble brain.

Without trying to understand very much, I get the impression that the
example is *not* reproducible.  It requires reading in Excel (yeucchh!)
files to which no-one but you has access.

Skip the reading-in completely.  Create toy data using rnorm() instead.
Then someone may be able to help you.

If the problem *didn't* persist, then *that* would have been
unfortunate!  The idea is to reproduce the problem in a simpler context
so that one can deduce what is causing the problem!

There are still (far) too many moving parts, for me anyway.  Someone
cleverer than I might be able to see what the problem is.

I had to place it right before the title and abline functions like so:

for (i in 1:length(Participant_Word_Task)){
    success_series <- xts(filter(Participant_Word_Task[[i]], GameEndReason == "TIMER_UP")$NumberOfSuccesfulWords , order.by=as.POSIXct(filter(Participant_Word_Task[[i]], GameEndReason == "TIMER_UP")$DeviceTime))
    original_series <- xts(Participant_Word_Task[[i]]$NumberOfSuccesfulWords, order.by=as.POSIXct(Participant_Word_Task[[i]]$DeviceTime))
    success_decomp <- ts(success_series, frequency = nweeks(success_series))
    original_decomp <- ts(original_series, frequency = nweeks(success_series))
    WordFrame[i,1] <- unique(Participant_Word_Task[[i]]$StudyId)
    WordFrame[i,2] <- "Boggle"
    WordFrame[i,3] <- MannKendall(success_decomp)$tau[1]
    WordFrame[i,4] <- MannKendall(success_decomp)$sl[1]
    WordFrame[i,5] <- sens.slope(success_decomp)$estimates
    WordFrame[i,6] <- sens.slope(success_decomp)$p.value
    WordFrame[i,7] <- pettitt.test(success_decomp)$estimate
    WordFrame[i,8] <- pettitt.test(success_decomp)$p.value
    WordFrame[i,10] <- difftime(time(success_series[WordFrame[i,7]]),time(original_series[1]))
    WordFrame[i,11] <- tail(which(grepl(success_series[WordFrame[i,7]], original_series)), n=1)
    WordFrame[i,12] <- sum(Participant_Word_Task[[i]]$TotalDuration[1:WordFrame[i,11]])-sum(Participant_Word_Task[[i]]$TotalTimePaused[1:WordFrame[i,11]])
    WordFrame[i,13] <- difftime(time(original_series[length(original_series)]),time(original_series[1]))
    WordFrame[i,14] <- length(original_series)
    WordFrame[i,15] <- sum(Participant_Word_Task[[i]]$TotalDuration[1:length(original_series)])-sum(Participant_Word_Task[[i]]$TotalTimePaused[1:length(original_series)])


    simplemovingaverage <- SMA(original_series, n = nweeks(original_series))
    if (WordFrame[i,4] <= 0.05 & WordFrame[i,6] <= 0.05 & WordFrame[i,8] <= 0.05){

 lines(simplemovingaverage,type='l',col='red'); title(paste("Word Task Acquisition for Subject", WordFrame[i,1])); abline(v = index(original_series[WordFrame[i,7]]),lty=2, col='green', lwd=3); dev.off()
      {
      pdf(file = paste(WordFrame[i,1],"_Word_Task_Acquisition.pdf",collapse = NULL, sep = ""))
      plout <- plot(original_series,type='l',col='blue',xlab="Date of Play",ylab="Number of Successful Words")
      lines(simplemovingaverage,type='l',col='red')
      print(plout)
      title(paste("Word Task Acquisition for Subject", WordFrame[i,1]))
      abline(v = index(original_series[WordFrame[i,7]]),lty=2, col='green', lwd=3)
      dev.off()
      }

      WordFrame[i,18] <- T
      WordFrame[i,16] <- (1-(WordFrame[i,10]/WordFrame[i,13]))
      WordFrame[i,17] <- (1-(WordFrame[i,12]/WordFrame[i,15]))
    } else {
      {
      pdf(file = paste(WordFrame[i,1],"_Word_Task_Acquisition.pdf",collapse = NULL, sep = ""))
      plout <- plot(original_series,type='l',col='blue',xlab="Date of Play",ylab="Number of Successful Words")
      lines(simplemovingaverage,type='l',col='red')
      print(plout)
      title(paste("Word Task Acquisition for Subject", WordFrame[i,1]))
      dev.off()
      }

      WordFrame[i,18] <- F
      WordFrame[i,16] <- 0
      WordFrame[i,17] <- 0
    }
}
?
But as soon as I did that it worked!

Thank you so much!

        External Email - Use Caution

Hi,

My hunch is that you need to add print(plout) before you call dev.off(). See https://stackoverflow.com/a/39853861<https://secure-web.cisco.com/1hPT2Maoird0h5FIvJrkRlN2QFkkujjs4YnHgtB5wYLuhRcHZGZ5SmvPC6x4VQ-rT2HqRBreJ_YeWM8Ug8HtScdp7g_E7nS4BfkHFtjiAKRId_AjYMKIvoJa-YojoOECa97gbnLx2QU535CBNKtd0Z-dzQns8z-C4Du8Jh6K3rEvmlP25DscJvrNcRUbisHQ67um6b6a-H9bqYYN-7QtBp2OGBjnh4LBzDR3TnMNVEF0dbhYTuP5zgP2NsHtCvRrwRUUApS1ZqUT0iiiQCrto3zWrSVlQ6aVOqTBgneUBEk_-8SkwVLgOccgGZyw37JTo/https%3A%2F%2Fstackoverflow.com%2Fa%2F39853861>

Try that and let me know if that works. If not, I'll take a closer look later.

Best,
Josh

Trying to make a nested loop that produces PDFs off different graphs, one for ACF/PACF diagnostics and another for the actual data, based on some time-series analyses I'm doing.

Unfortunately, I keep getting the dreaded: Error plot.new has not been called yet

The code is meant to write a PDF containing the ACF and PACF graphs, then do some analyses on the timeseries, and then make a separate PDF containing a plot describing the timeseries based on the p-values of each test for each individual.

              WordFrame[i,17] <- 0
    }
}

It will work just fine if I run the lines individually (e.g. set i = 1, 2, ect), and if I comment out abline and title (lines seems to work fine). But it will throw the error everytime I try to run the loop without these commented.

Have tried just about everything I could find on the Stack forums to run everything as a single argument and I'm just not sure what is wrong with it.

dev.list() spits out:

pdf
  2
following the error.

With abline and title commented out and lines run individually it's NULL.

Happens in both RStudio

Petr, 
You also might want to check out the bug reported here:

https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18379

it was fixed and the last two comments discuss how to handle it in Windows:

you add a new User Environment Variable:
R_LIBCURL_SSL_REVOKE_BEST_EFFORT and set it to TRUE

This fix is in R-4.2.1 Patched (I don't know if it has made it out to the full distribution) and works in my 'corporate' environment.  Perhaps it also applies to your environment.

Subject: [R] Fixed effect model: different estimation approaches with R
 return different results
Message-ID: <CABZtLWwwgUfZ24tLA-Ub2w6kzMwsSuDWkCkWu2rapS7Gs+psaw@mail.gmail.com>

Good morning,
I am trying to use R to estimate a fixed effects model (i.e., a panel
regression model controlling for unobserved time-invariant
heterogeneities across agents) using different estimation approaches
(e.g. replicating xtreg from Stata, see e.g.
https://www.stata.com/support/faqs/statistics/intercept-in-fixed-effects-model/).
I have already asked this question on different stacks exchange forums
and contacted package creators who dealt with this issue before, but I
wasn't able to obtain an answer to my doubts.
I hope to have better luck on this list.

Let me introduce the problem, and note that I am using an unbalanced panel.

The easiest way to estimate my fixed effect model is using the function lm.

Example:

# load packages
library(dplyr)
# set seed for replication purposes
set.seed(123)
# create toy dataset
x <- rnorm(4000)
x2 <- rnorm(length(x))
id <- factor(sample(500,length(x),replace=TRUE))
firm <- data.frame(id = id) %>%
group_by(id) %>%
mutate(firm = 1:n()) %>%
pull(firm)
id.eff <- rlnorm(nlevels(id))
firm.eff <- rexp(length(unique(firm)))
y <- x + 0.25*x2 + id.eff[id] + firm.eff[firm] + rnorm(length(x))
db = data.frame(y = y, x = x, id = id, firm = firm)
rm <- db %>% group_by(id) %>% summarise(firm = max(firm)) %>%
filter(firm == 1) %>% pull(id)
db = db[-which(db$id %in% rm), ]
# Run regression
test <- lm(y ~ x + id, data = db)

Another approach is demeaning the variables included into the model
specification.
In this way, one can exclude the fixed effects from the model. Of
course, point estimates will be correct, while standard errors will be
not (because we are not accounting for the degrees of freedom used in
the demeaning).

# demean data
dbm <- as_tibble(db) %>%
group_by(id) %>%
mutate(y = y - mean(y),
       x = x - mean(x)) %>%
ungroup()
# run regression
test2 <- lm(y ~ x, data = dbm)
# compare results
summary(test)$coefficients[2,1]
> 0.9753364
summary(test2)$coefficients[2,1]
> 0.9753364

Another way to do this is to demean the variables and add their grand
average (I believe that this is what xtreg from Stata does)

# create data
n = length(unique(db$id))
dbh <- dbm %>%
mutate(yh = y + (sum(db$y)/n),
       xh = x + (sum(db$x)/n))
# run regression
test3 <- lm(yh ~ xh, dbh)
# compare results
summary(test)$coefficients[2,1]
> 0.9753364
summary(test2)$coefficients[2,1]
> 0.9753364
summary(test3)$coefficients[2,1]
> 0.9753364

As one can see, the three approaches report the same point estimates
(again, standard errors will be different instead).

When I include an additional set of fixed effects in the model
specification, the three approaches no longer return the same point
estimate. However, differences seem to be negligible and they could be
due to rounding.

db$firm <- as.factor(db$firm)
dbm$firm <- as.factor(dbm$firm)
dbh$firm <- as.factor(dbh$firm)
testB <- lm(y ~ x + id + firm, data = db)
testB2 <- lm(y ~ x + firm, data = dbm)
testB3 <- lm(yh ~ xh + firm, data = dbh)
summary(testB)$coefficients[2,1]
> 0.9834414
summary(testB2)$coefficients[2,1]
> 0.9833334
summary(testB3)$coefficients[2,1]
> 0.9833334

A similar behavior occurs if I use a dummy variable rather than a
continous one. For the only purpose of the example, I show this by
transforming my target variable x from a continuous to a dummy
variable.

# create data
x3 <- ifelse(db$x > 0, 1, 0)
db <- db %>% mutate(x3 = x3)
dbm <- dbm %>%
mutate(x3 = x3) %>%
group_by(id) %>%
mutate(x3 = x3 - mean(x3)) %>%
ungroup()
dbh <- dbh %>% mutate(x3 = dbm$x3) %>%
mutate(x3 = x3 + (sum(db$x3)/n)) %>%
ungroup()
# Run regressions
testC <- lm(y ~ x3 + id + firm, data = db)
testC2 <- lm(y ~ x3 + firm, data = dbm)
testC3 <- lm(yh ~ x3 + firm, data = dbh)
summary(testC)$coefficients[2, 1]
> 1.579883
summary(testC2)$coefficients[2, 1]
> 1.579159
summary(testC3)$coefficients[2, 1]
> 1.579159

Now, I want to estimate both the impact of x when this is higher than
0 (i.e., x3) and when this is lower or equal to zero (call it x4).
Again, observe that x3 might as well be a real dummy variable, not a
transformation of a continuous variable.

In order to do that, I exclude the intercept from my model.
Specifically, I do the following:

# create data
x4 <- ifelse(db$x <= 0, 1, 0)
db <- db %>% mutate(x4 = x4)
dbm <- dbm %>%
mutate(x4 = x4) %>%
group_by(id) %>%
mutate(x4 = x4 - mean(x4)) %>%
ungroup()
dbh <- dbh %>% mutate(x4 = dbm$x4) %>%
mutate(x4 = x4 + (sum(db$x4)/n)) %>%
ungroup()
testD <- lm(y ~ x3 + x4 + id + firm - 1, data = db)
testD2 <- lm(y ~ x3 + x4 + firm - 1, data = dbm)
testD3 <- lm(yh ~ x3 + x4 + firm - 1, data = dbh)
summary(testD)$coefficients[1:2, ]
> 1.2372816 -0.3426011
summary(testD2)
> Call:
lm(formula = y ~ x3 + x4 + firm - 1, data = dbm)

Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max
-3.8794 -0.7497  0.0010  0.7442  3.8486

Coefficients: (1 not defined because of singularities)
       Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
x3      1.57916    0.03779  41.788  < 2e-16 ***
x4           NA         NA      NA       NA
... redacted
summary(testD3)$coefficients[1:2]
> 3.254654 1.675495

As you can see, the second approach is not able to estimate the impact
of x4 on y. At the same time, the first and the third approach return
very different point estimates.

Is anyone able to explain me why I cannot obtain the same point
estimates for this last exercise?

Is there anything wrong in the way I include the second set of fixed effects?
Is there anything wrong in the way I include the variables x3 and x4?
Or this is simply a problem due to some internal functions in R?

Any hint would be much appreciated.

Best,
Valerio

Hallo Howard

Thanks, for the time being the previous workaround with wininet options
works for me. I will wait for the new R version and then try to persuade our
IT to make relevant changes.

Cheers
Petr

Subject: [R] Fixed effect model: different estimation approaches with R
 return different results

You could get lucky here, but strictly speaking, this list is about R
programming and statistical issues are typically off topic Someone might
respond privately, though.

Subject: [R] Getting "Error in ect,

Here is how you could have made an example that helpers could easily run.
It also includes the fix.

f <- function(print.it = FALSE) {
   pdf(file.pdf <- tempfile(fileext=".pdf"))
   series <- as.xts(setNames(sin(seq(0,10,by=.1)),
seq(as.Date("2022-10-06"),by="weeks",len=101)))
   p <- plot(series)
   if (print.it) {
       print(p)
   }
   sm_series_2 <- smooth(series / 2)
   lines(sm_series_2, col="red")
   abline(h=0.1, col="blue")
   dev.off()
   file.pdf
}
> f()
Error in plot.xy(xy.coords(x, y), type = type, ...) :
  plot.new has not been called yet
> f(TRUE)
[1]
"C:\\Users\\willi\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Rtmp0wX7rO\\file34843df652c.pdf"

If you remove the pdf() and dev.off() I think you will see that the added
lines do not show up.  I think plot.xts fiddles with the coordinate system
before and after it plots so that add-ons must be done in a special way.

Subject: [R] Fixed effect model: different estimation approaches with R
 return different results

Thank you Bert, I see your point.
The problem is that I am not sure if this is a statistical issue -
i.e., there is something wrong with my procedure - or, in a manner of
speaking, a software issue: e.g. lm is not expected to return the same
estimates for different approaches because of the way in which the
function estimates the solution, and it should not be used the way I
do. Maybe I should have better stressed this.

plot.xts() waits until the plot is rendered before calculating the
coordinate system. That allows users to add multiple series that have
different values for the index (x-axis) and data (y-axis).

lines() doesn't show up in your example because it's called after the
plot is rendered, and it's not rendered again after they're added.
`sm_series_2` also needs to be an xts object, otherwise lines.xts() is
not dispatched.

title() and abline() need to be called after the plot is rendered
because they are standard graphics functions. I admit that's very
confusing... I'll see what I can do to fix that.

Here's a revised example that works for me:

f <- function(print.it = FALSE)
{
    pdf(file.pdf <- tempfile(fileext=".pdf"))
    series <- xts(sin(seq(0,10,by=.1)),
seq(as.Date("2022-10-06"),by="weeks",length.out=101))
    p <- plot(series)
    sm2 <- xts(smooth(series/2), index(series))
    lines(sm2, col="red")
    if (print.it) {
        print(p)
        title("Sine curve example")
        abline(h=0.1, col="green")
    }
    dev.off()
    file.pdf
}
f(TRUE)

Hi ,
Can you send me a later version of r programming to use on my macos version
10.12.6? The newest r program is not compatible with my macbook.
Thank you, Julie :)

Hello,

I am not a Mac user but have you tried the official R downloads web 
site, The Comprehensive R Archive Network - CRAN?
Here is the link:

https://cran.r-project.org/

Hope this helps,

Truly appreciate it Bill.

Will try to make something more trimmed down in the future, but unfortunately have to admit I am more of an R neophyte than I would like to be.

Since R 4.0.0, the official builds of R require macOS ? 10.13. The
Homebrew project doesn't seem to have any binaries for 10.12 either,
but it should be able to build R for you:
https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/r#default

Alternatively, you can follow the guide at
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html and build
the source code yourself.

We have a special mailing list dedicated to Mac-related questions:
r-sig-mac at r-project.org

Subject: [R] Ids with matching number combinations?
Message-ID: <GV3P280MB0691B68DAEE14884207FEDE88F5F9@GV3P280MB0691.SWEP280.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hi,

If I have two datasets like this:
df=data.frame("id"=rep(1:10,10, each=10), "item1"=sample(1:20, 100, replace=T)
df2=data.frame("a"=c(8, 8,10,9, 5, 1,2,1), "b"=c(16,18,11, 19,18, 11,17,12))

How do I find out which ids in the df dataset that has a match for both the numbers occuring in the same row in the df2 dataframe? In the output I would like to get the matching id and the rownumber from the df2.

Output something like this
Id                        Rownr
2                         1
5                         1
7                         4

My actual problem is more complex with even more columns to be matched and the datasets are large, hence the solution needs to be efficient.

Kind regards,

Hallo Marine

Could you please make your example more reproducible by using set.seed (and
maybe smaller)?

If I understand correctly, you want to know if let say row 1 items from df2
(8,16) are both in item column of specific id?

If I am correct in guessing, I cannot find another solution than split your
df according to id
x <- split(df, df$id)[[1]]

and for each row of df2 test if within the specified id you can find both
numbers.
sum(is.element(df2[1,], x$item))==2
[1] FALSE

So basically 2 cycles, one for df ids and the other for df2 rows.

But maybe somebody will give you more ingenious answer.

Cheers
Petr

Would an inner_join work? If not, please describe why so that we can improve our answer. This answer requires the dplyr package.

The merge function doesn't require a package.

But inner_join may be faster than merge.

Well, for a start, you might give us a reproducible example that actually
runs -- yours doesn't. Did you check? You seem to b.e missing a final
")"(Also, you do not need to quote the column names in data.frame(), though
it works fine also if you do).

Also note that in df, your id column has length 1000 and item1 column has
length 100 and will be replicated to match id. This seems to me likely to
be misspecified. Or is this what you meant?

Finally, note that that none of the rows in df2 have identical numbers, so
there is no id in df that can match both members of the row. So did you
mean that the 'id' and 'item1' value in a row of df must match the
corresponding 'a' and 'b' values of some row in df2 ?

Under the above interpretation and with the following reprex(note the use
of set.seed() to make it reproducible)...

set.seed(1234)  ## for reproducibility
df=data.frame(id=c(10,rep(1:10, each=10), item1=sample(1:20, 100,
replace=T))
df2=data.frame(a=c(8, 8,10,9, 5, 1,2,1), b=c(16,18,11, 19,18, 11,17,12))

... you can paste0() the column vectors together in each data frame(as
character values) and then just match on the single character vectors, like
this:

both <- match(do.call(paste0,df),  do.call(paste0, df2))
## subscript the data frames if you have more columns that are not used for
matching

> both
  [1] NA NA  8 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
 [21] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
 [41] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
 [61] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
 [81] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA  3 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA  3

Then
> both[!is.na(both)] ## the rows of df2 that matched
[1] 8 3 3

> which(!is.na(both)) ## the rows of df that were matched
[1]   3  91 100

This should be very efficient, as hashing is used for matching.

I think there is a slicker way to do this that combines the paste and match
functions together (other than using merge() or the like, as has already
been suggested). But I have forgotten the details or I may just be thinking
of merge(), which may indeed be a better option.

All presuming this is what you meant, of course, which it may not be. :-(

Cheers,
Bert

Hi Marine,
I'm not sure that I have the right idea, but this worked for me and may help.

# I had to fix this line
df<-data.frame(id=rep(1:10,each=10),item1=sample(1:20, 100, replace=TRUE))
df2<-data.frame(a=c(8, 8,10,9, 5, 1,2,1),b=c(16,18,11, 19,18, 11,17,12))
result<-data.frame(id=df[,1],rown=1:dim(df)[1],matched=rep(FALSE,dim(dfw)[1]))
# function that checks that all entries in vector a exist in vector x
match_all_a<-function(a,x,index) {
 inx<-TRUE
 for(i in 1:length(a)) inx <- inx && a[i] %in% x[-1]
 return(list(id=x[1],rown=index,matched=inx))
}
# step through the data frame
for(i in df[,1]) result[i,]<-match_all_a(df2[i,],df[i,],i)
# display the result id, row in df, whether matched
result
# select the rows of result for which matched is TRUE

Subject: [R] Reading Text files from UK Met Office into R again...
Message-ID: <CABxY9BNPKdWh=0TRqiQ_3UNqcvuzBToUQ5hRY8gLBZhYnnJLAA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello I've had some invaluable help from folk about downloading files from
the UK Met Office - unfortunately I now have another one which I can't
solve and I wonder whether anyone's got any ideas.

I'm trying to download hourly weather records from the Met Office

 https://data.ceda.ac.uk/badc/ukmo-midas/data/WH/yearly_files



Up to 2010 everything's fine and dandy - the data is in nice neat columns
and I can download it and filter out what I don't want.  But after 2010 the
format changes (The Met Office in fact say on their guidelines that it
changes)  - it's still a text doc but instead of columns it seems to be one
long vector.  Here is a short sample:



2015-01-01 00:00, 03002, WMO, SYNOP, 1, 12, 1011, 4, 7, 200, 18, 82, , , 8,

If I could download it I should still be able to use it as I could identify
each separate line as it will be headed by a date.   The files are v large
c 1GB and when I start to download in R it works for a while and then
after maybe 30 seconds I get this error message:



Error in read.table("midas_wxhrly_201501-201512.txt", fill = T) :
  duplicate 'row.names' are not allowed


The instruction in the error message works perfectly well up to 2010, and I
can?t see where a ?duplicate rowname? would come in this data anyway


Is there a way of either downloading the file without getting the error
message or of being able to identify at what point in the file the error
message is being generated so that I could, by hand possibly, take out
whatever the problem is?



I?ve tried putting the downloaded text doc into other formats but nothing
seems to work

If anyone has any ideas I?d be v grateful   Thanks Nick Wray

Subject: [R] how to enlarge the legend
Message-ID: <ec42dba5-5ea0-a029-20e9-3b77edd9c375@yeah.net>

Hi there,

in the following code, I'd like to enlarge the filled box but not the 
legend text.

plot.new()

legend("topleft", "text", fill = "gray") # filled box is too small

legend("top", "text", fill = "gray", cex = 2) # filled box is ok but 
text is too large

# I can use point to mimic filled box, but can not fill it with pattern

legend("left", "text", pch = 22, pt.bg = "gray", pt.cex =3)

I'd like to get filled box enlarged but with text not to be changed. Is 
it possible?

Thanks in advance!

Best,

Jinsong

Did you use the 'box.lwd' argument to set the width of the box? If so, why
does this not work for you? If not, set it to a bigger value.

Nope. Sorry. Ignore my comment. box.lwd changes the width of the box line,
bot the width of the box.

Since you don't pass the `header` argument, I think that the automatic
header detection is here at play. This is what ?read.table has to say
about row names:

>> If there is a header and the first row contains one fewer field than
>> the number of columns, the first column in the input is used for the

Perhaps the "one fewer field in the header than the number of columns"
condition is true for files after 2010? I'm too lazy to sign up for a
CEDA account and I'm not sure I'd be given access to hourly datasets
anyway.

If this is the reason for the failure (first column used as rownames()
and turns out to be non-unique), there's an easy way to fix that:

>> Using ?row.names = NULL? forces row numbering.

I don't see a header in your example. If there's actually no header
containing column names, passing `header = FALSE` will both prevent the
error and avoid eating the first line of the file.

I have created several plots using the forestplot package and the link shown here. <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/forestplot/vignettes/forestplot.html > Great package !
Next step is to combine two plots into a single graphic. The code provided on the link results in 'bleeding' of the graphics/text into each other. I don't want to clip it as I need the text elements. I am guessing the problem involves the combination of text and graphics in the 'plot'. I fooled around with the original post and also did some hunting online but no luck Thanks in advance.

Dear R members

 

I am working with RStudio R 4.2.0 and using ggplot2 and gridExtra. 

Since some windows updates I get some error when loading  ggplot2.

*	It seems that I am able to install ggplot2. The problem is when
loading ggplot2 with library().
*	Do you have any ideas to solve the problem?

 

 

Kind regards

Sibylle

Can you please provide us with a copy of the error msg? I have used ggplot2 with R 4.2.1, and probably R 4.2.0 in RStudio on Windows 11 and not had trouble. You might need to update R, or RStudio. R and RStudio need to be compatible versions.

Thanks a lot. I will try again. The error code was below the email, but there was some encryption:
- Error in nchar(homeDir:invalid multibyte string, element 1
- I realised that I was able to install ggplot2, but the error is afterwards when loading ggplot2 (library()).

	  From long and unhappy experience, I routinely reboot before reporting 
problems like this, then upgrade all software where feasible ... 
including "update.packages".  Some problems magically disappear after 
doing this.


	  If they persist, then, as it says at the end of each email on this 
thread, "PLEASE do read the posting guide 
http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html and provide commented, 
minimal, self-contained, reproducible code."  If you do that, it 
increases the chances that the help you get will actually be helpful ;-)

I searched for nchar(homeDir) in the R source code and on CRAN (as
indexed by GitHub), and the only CRAN match was probably unrelated (in
the ibmdbR package).

There's also a few matches in the RStudio source code:
https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/blob/3742521ab2e67528090358a42d9f13933f4400df/src/cpp/session/modules/SessionPackages.R

A search of "nchar(homeDir)" on RStudio website gives a lot of
seemingly relevant results.

However, I don't see them doing anything obviously wrong. This could be
related to stricter handling of invalid strings that was recently
improved in R:
https://blog.r-project.org/2022/10/10/improvements-in-handling-bytes-encoding/

What does path.expand("~/") return on your machine? What is Encoding(.)
of the value? What are its actual byte values, i.e. charToRaw(.)? What
is your sessionInfo()?

Subject: [R] prcomp - arbitrary direction of the returned principal
 components
Message-ID: <CAC8=1eqUJoYUqq_bDeUCpWL79ootuV44+oSkZ5=oPHnrCsGY5Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R experts,

>From ?prcomp,

---- snip -----
Note:

     The signs of the columns of the rotation matrix are arbitrary, and
     so may differ between different programs for PCA, and even between
     different builds of R.
---- snip ------

My problem is that I am building an index based on Principal
Components Analysis.
When the index is high it should indicate stress in the market. Due to
the arbitrary sign sometimes I get an index which is HIGH when there
is stress and sometimes I get  the OPPOSITE - an index which is LOW
when there is stress.
This program is shared with other people who may have a different build of R.

I can forcefully use a NEGATIVE sign to FLIP the index when it is LOW.
That works.

Now my query is : Just like we do set.seed(1234) and force the pattern
of generation of random number and make it REPRODUCIBLE, can I do
something like :

set.direction.for.vector.in.pca(1234)

Now each time I do prcomp it should choose the SAME ( high or low )
direction of the principle component on ANY computer having ANY
version of R installed.

That's what I want. I don't want the the returned principal component
to be HIGH(LOW) on my computer and LOW(HIGH) on someone else's
computer.
That would confuse the people the code is shared with.

Is this possible ? How do people deal with this ?

Many thanks,
Ashim

Dear Aaron,

Many thanks for your reply.

Please allow me to illustrate my query a bit.

I take some data, throw it to prcomp and extract the x data frame from prcomp.

>From ?prcomp:

       x: if ?retx? is true the value of the rotated data (the centred
          (and scaled if requested) data multiplied by the ?rotation?
          matrix) is returned.  Hence, ?cov(x)? is the diagonal matrix
          ?diag(sdev^2)?.  For the formula method, ?napredict()? is
          applied to handle the treatment of values omitted by the
          ?na.action?.

I consider x[,1] as my index. This makes sense as x[,1] is the
projection of the data on the FIRST principal component.
Now this x[,1] can be a high +ve number or a low -ve number. I can't
ignore the sign.

If I ignore the sign by taking the absolute value, the HIGH / LOW
stress values will be indistinguishable.

Hence I do not think using absolute values of x[,1] is the solution.
Yes it will make the results REPRODUCIBLE but that will be at the cost
of losing information.

Any other idea ?

Many thanks,
Ashim

I agree with this and I'm not very sure why you feel you need the signs
fixed one way: they are arbitrary and how they come out is generally a
function of things in the handling of rounding as values hit the limit
of the finite arithmetic in the particular program and OS and hardware
on which it's running.? Can't you just say that?!

If you must have it aligned one way then I think the only thing you can
do is to select the row/item/variable with the highest absolute loading
on the component and set that to be positive (say, whether you choose
positive or negative is up to you).? I think this does it:

### create some data to analyse
set.seed(12345)
n <- 500 # number of observations
k <- 8 # number of variables
fuzz <- .1 # used to add noise
varLatent <- rnorm(n) # create the values of the dominant PC
vecLoadings <- c(rep(1, k/2), rep(-1, k/2)) # binary loadings 

### make the raw data
matData <- matrix(rep(NA, n * k), ncol = k)
for (i in 1:k) {
? matData[, i] <- vecLoadings[i] * varLatent + rnorm(n, fuzz)
}
head(matData)

### get the PCA
matPrcomp <- prcomp(matData)$rotation
round(matPrcomp, 2)
# PC1?? PC2?? PC3?? PC4?? PC5?? PC6?? PC7?? PC8
# [1,]? 0.34? 0.00 -0.74? 0.32 -0.38 -0.25? 0.15? 0.00
# [2,]? 0.37 -0.19? 0.49? 0.33 -0.57? 0.38? 0.07 -0.01
# [3,]? 0.34? 0.80? 0.14? 0.11? 0.10 -0.05 -0.16 -0.43
# [4,]? 0.33 -0.47 -0.16? 0.10? 0.34? 0.17 -0.61 -0.35
# [5,] -0.35? 0.15 -0.15 -0.34 -0.61? 0.10 -0.57 -0.08
# [6,] -0.37 -0.25? 0.11? 0.13 -0.14 -0.30? 0.27 -0.77
# [7,] -0.35? 0.07? 0.17? 0.72? 0.04 -0.32 -0.38? 0.28
# [8,] -0.38? 0.17 -0.32? 0.33? 0.14? 0.75? 0.16 -0.12

### find the sign of the maximum absolute loading for each component
vecMaxItemSigns <- apply(matPrcomp, 2,
function(x){sign(x[(which.max(abs(x)))])})
vecMaxItemSigns
# PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 PC6 PC7 PC8 
# -1?? 1? -1?? 1? -1?? 1? -1? -1

### now use that to create a new PCA where the strongest loadings are
always positive
newMatPrcomp <- matrix(rep(NA, k * k), ncol = k)
colnames(newMatPrcomp) <- colnames(matPrcomp)
rownames(newMatPrcomp) <- rownames(matPrcomp)
for (i in 1:k) {
? newMatPrcomp[, i] <- matPrcomp[, i] * vecMaxItems[i]
}
round(newMatPrcomp, 2)
# PC1?? PC2?? PC3?? PC4?? PC5?? PC6?? PC7?? PC8
# [1,] -0.34? 0.00? 0.74? 0.32? 0.38 -0.25 -0.15? 0.00
# [2,] -0.37 -0.19 -0.49? 0.33? 0.57? 0.38 -0.07? 0.01
# [3,] -0.34? 0.80 -0.14? 0.11 -0.10 -0.05? 0.16? 0.43

# [8,]? 0.38? 0.17? 0.32? 0.33 -0.14? 0.75 -0.16? 0.12


Apologies for the coding: I'm a better therapist than coder and
it's a while since I've done much in base R like this.? Quite fun
to get back to it!? R artistes can probably do that in four lines!

But I'm not convinced doing this to "fix" the signs is really 
worth it however many lines one uses to code it!!

Very best all,

Chris

Subject: [R] cat in a subroutine
Message-ID: <3b66dae8-73dc-dbbb-3cb9-20b265f2f0e3@ntu.edu.tw>

I have had an issue with printing (with cat) in a subroutine for which I 
do not have a applicable example, but I am still hoping to get some 
help. In the following, the first block of code works fine.

...

t<-abs(me)/se; p<-2*(1-pt(t,nrow(x)))
sig<-my.sig.levels(p)
out<-data.frame(round(cbind(me,se,t,p),digits)); out<-cbind(out,sig)
rownames(out)<-names(me)
colnames(out)<-c("est","se","t","p","sig")
j<-grep(".one\\b",rownames(out))
out<-out[-j,]
return(out)
}

But as soon as I insert lines to print (cat) soething simple, it spits 
out message that appears to be nonsence (unrelated). Any idea. Please 
help. Thanks.

t<-abs(me)/se; p<-2*(1-pt(t,nrow(x)))
sig<-my.sig.levels(p)
out<-data.frame(round(cbind(me,se,t,p),digits)); out<-cbind(out,sig)
rownames(out)<-names(me)
colnames(out)<-c("est","se","t","p","sig")
cat("\nMarginal and Discrete Effects of Gen Ordered Logit / Probit 
Probabilities",
 ??? "\n\nlogistic =",logistic)
j<-grep(".one\\b",rownames(out))
out<-out[-j,]
return(out)
}

In this particular case, the error message was as follows:

Error in cat("\nMarginal and Discrete Effects of Gen Ordered Logit / 
Probit Probabilities",? :
 ? unused argument (logistic)

I have printed this way in numerous routines without problem and do not 
see why this is happending.

Hi Steven:

Do you have a variable called logistic, please?  I think that might be the
culprit.

Thanks,
Erin

Thanks Erin.

No. Removing the second line (so that cat simply prints something else),

cat("\nMarginal and Discrete Effects of Gen Ordered Logit / Probit 
Probabilities")
#??? "\n\nlogistic =",logistic)

I get yet another nonsense:

Error in cat("\nMarginal and Discrete Effects of Gen Ordered Logit / 
Probit Probabilities") :
 ? argument "j" is missing, with no default

All right.  Are these lines of code part of a larger function, please?  Is
that function possibly calling a loop, please?

Yes, these lines are part of a subroutine calling yet more procedures. What frustrated me was, I am not doing anything different from other routines. My cat command in the recent code does not do anything other than printing a line of plain text. I am clueless.

Hi Steven,
I think Erin is right, unless there is a variable named "logistic"
visible within the function, "cat" will think it is either an argument
or an R object. If you have the "psych" package loaded, it may see it
as a closure. There is also a "Logistic" in the stats package, but
that shouldn't be visible due to the capital L

Steven, would you mind putting that section of code in again, with the cat
statement, please?

I have an idea...

Hi Steven & Erin,
This works:

fortytwo<-42
cat("\nMarginal and Discrete Effects of Gen Ordered Logit / Probit
Probabilities","logisitic =",fortytwo,"\n")
j<-grep(".one\\b",c(".one\\a",".one\\b"))

Marginal and Discrete Effects of Gen Ordered Logit / Probit
Probabilities logisitic = 42

If I don't define fortytwo before calling cat, it doesn't.
So we know what the answer is.

Jim

Have you assigned the valuie of goprobit1.r.me.kr to "fortytwo", or
indeed anything?

No. I just run the subroutine containing those line? with result going to destination go probit1.r.me.it and printed it.

I don't see any problems with quoting or parentheses in the parts of
the code you're showing us, but they may be present elsewhere.

If you step the function in debugger (see ?debugonce and ?browser),
does it crash in the call to cat()?

If you take your function apart by applying as.list(body(fun)) (and
furthermore applying as.list() to any parts of the function), do you
see the call to cat() taking exactly the arguments you mean it to take?

Have you considered using supervised methods, like PLS, to predict
stress in the market?

Imagine what happens when you take the points where there's stress in
the market and feed only those to PCA. The first principal direction is
now gone (if there is a variation along this axis, it's much smaller
than it was), so now some other direction occupies its place. Even if
the first direction is preserved, after centering, there are now points
with low values of PC1, despite all points should correspond to stress
in the market.

Apologies if the paragraph above is complete nonsense, a reasonable
researched would always conduct the analysis on a representative sample
of the points, and the whole point of the proposed index is that high
stress is indicated by points on the positive end of the multivariate
sausage that PCA considers the data to be. If that's the case,
post-processing the signs as described by Chris Evans could be the
right solution.

I still do not understand. However, the general approach would be to identify a specific value to test. If the test is TRUE then do "this" otherwise do nothing. Once the test condition is properly identified, the coding easily follows.

 abs() is the same as
if x<0 then x = -x   (non-R code, just idea)
The R code might look something more like
for (number in 1:ncol(x)){
   if (x[3,2] < 0) {
         x[number, number] = -x[number, number] #only change the diagonal
   }
}

Depending on what values need to be changed you may need a nested for loop to go through all values of x[number1, number2]. 

Your words: " I can forcefully use a NEGATIVE sign to FLIP the index when it is LOW." Where it appeared that "low" was defined as values that are negative. You still will have low values (close to zero) and high values (far from zero). 

You could make the condition some other value:

if x< -4 then x = -x

If you just want to rotate about zero then 
x = -x
In this case the positive values will become negative and the negative values positive.
Add an if test to selectively rotate based on the value of a single test element in x (as in x[3,2]). 

In debugging or trouble shooting setting seed is useful. For actual data analysis you should not set seed, or possibly better yet use set.seed(NULL).

[External Email]

Dear Aaron,

Many thanks for your reply.

Please allow me to illustrate my query a bit.

I take some data, throw it to prcomp and extract the x data frame from prcomp.

>From ?prcomp:

       x: if 'retx' is true the value of the rotated data (the centred
          (and scaled if requested) data multiplied by the 'rotation'
          matrix) is returned.  Hence, 'cov(x)' is the diagonal matrix
          'diag(sdev^2)'.  For the formula method, 'napredict()' is
          applied to handle the treatment of values omitted by the
          'na.action'.

I consider x[,1] as my index. This makes sense as x[,1] is the projection of the data on the FIRST principal component.
Now this x[,1] can be a high +ve number or a low -ve number. I can't ignore the sign.

If I ignore the sign by taking the absolute value, the HIGH / LOW stress values will be indistinguishable.

Hence I do not think using absolute values of x[,1] is the solution.
Yes it will make the results REPRODUCIBLE but that will be at the cost of losing information.

Any other idea ?

Many thanks,
Ashim

mytree

Ivan Krylov has kindly turned this into a bug report, please see

https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=18412

for more details. In short, yes, using format=13 is recommended, but 
please note it has already been documented in ?writeClipboard.

Yes, I agree, I've changed the default to format=13.

This is a bit complicated and more can be found in the bug report 
response. In short, the clipboard is capable of holding either "text" 
(then with locale information) or "Unicode text". One can ask Windows 
for either content and Windows will do the conversion, it would convert 
from "text" to "Unicode text" using that locale. If that locale is not 
filled in explicitly, it is the current input language (so the 
"keyboard" the user has selected at the time of the copying to 
clipboard, e.g. of writeClipboard). If that locale encoding doesn't 
match the R current native encoding, and you are using "text", 
characters may be mis-represented. This could have happened even before 
R 4.2.0, but is more likely from R 4.2.0 when it uses UTF-8. Going via 
"Unicode text" resolves the issue as the conversion to/from UTF-16LE is 
done by readClipboard/writeClipboard using the R current native encoding.

Users who don't want to deal with these complexities can use the 
higher-level connections interface (?connections, "clipboard").

Tomas

Dear All,

Many thanks for your replies.

My PC1 loading turns out to be :

1/sqrt(2) , -1/sqrt(2)

In simple words : I had 2 variables and I ran prcomp on them. I got my
PC1 as :  .7071068 var1 - .7071068 var2

PC2 turned out to be the same as PC1 with a PLUS replacing the minus,
ie. .7071068 var1 + .7071068 var2

But forget PC2 for the time being.

Now my question is : I am not able to use the rule that : choose the
variable with a bigger magnitude of loading and multiply PC1 by -1 if
needed (to flip the PC1 since any vector x and it's flipped version -x
 are the same vector but with opposite direction) if the variable with
bigger magnitude is of negative sign.

I have an alternative measure of stress which is trending UP and has 2
peaks during 2 recessions and I can see that PC1 is trending DOWN and
has 2 TROUGHS during the same recessions. That's how I wish to FLIP
PC1 with a negative sign.

The data is not mine and I am not at liberty to share it. I can
construct an artificial example but I would need time to do that.

That's what's happening.

Best Regards and
Many thanks.
Ashim

Do you have another function called "cat" in scope? (with an argument
called "j")?  Before calling cat("...") call print(cat) and
print(find("cat")).

This reminds me of a situation in 1975 where a large computer service bureau had
contracted to migrate scientific software from a Univac 1108 to a an IBM System 360.
They spent 3 weeks trying to get the IBM to give the same eigenvectors on a problem as the
Univac. There were at least 2 eigenvalues that were equal. They were trying to fix
something that was not broken. Their desperation was enough to offer me a very large fee
to "fix" things. However, I had a nice job, so told them to go away and read a couple of
books on the real-symmetric eigenvalue problem or singular value decomposition, though the
latter was just becoming known outside of numerical linear algebra.

I suspect the OP should go back to basics with principal components and not try to fiddle
with the output. It is likely that the "loadings" (I'm never sure of the nomenclature -- I
use the matrix setup) can be rotated, but you can't just rotate one vector of a set on its
own.

Amazing how these old issues linger for decades. Or maybe linear algebra is not on the
curriculum.

Dear Helmut,

thanks for the report, this is actually a bug in Rterm (or Windows, hard 
to tell, but something that can be fixed in Rterm). More below

The underlying problem I can reproduce on my Windows 10 (which is almost 
surely what you are seeing on Windows 11) is that characters ? and ? 
cannot be pasted to RTerm when running in cmd.exe or PowerShell. Pasting 
these characters pastes nothing.

I've fixed this now in R-devel 83094 (and R-patched 83095). I would be 
grateful if you (or anyone else) could test e.g. in R-patched, most 
likely this example will work as it did for me, but also other examples 
you can think of. Processing the input keys in Rterm/getline is very 
tricky and brittle. What the code sees depends on what the console 
implementation decides to do, and it differs for different console 
implementations, and sadly this is not documented as far as I could find.

Now, the problem you reported does not happen in Msys2/mintty (so 
Rtools42) terminal, because the terminal uses a different console 
implementation. Also, the problem doesn't happen with the Windows 
Terminal application, which has a yet different implementation. If you 
ever needed a work-around to such problems, I would recommend trying the 
Windows Terminal application.

The problem doesn't happen in Rgui, either, but that uses a different 
code path completely on R end, indeed it does not run Rterm.

There is a key combination "Alt+I" you can press in RTerm, which will 
switch to debug mode and will display the keyboard codes R receives (it 
matches the sources in getline.c). When one sees different behavior of 
things like your reported problem in with different console 
implementations, it usually comes with different keyboard codes sent to R.

Your report has been very useful, thanks, and sorry for the long delay. 
I would have spotted it earlier on R bugzilla (or R-devel) list.

Best

You are right, R already tries to set the console code page itself to 
65001, so chcp is no longer needed to change it.

On Windows 7 UTF-8 would not be used by R because it can't be the 
"system encoding" (ACP), and I suppose Helmut's output was from that 
version of Windows:

x = y, x = y; a ? b, a ? b

This suggests transliteration ("best-fit") of the characters not 
representable in the session encoding, done by Windows. On Windows 7, 
characters not representable in the user locale encoding will not be 
usable in Rterm, there is no way around that, but one can e.g. use Rgui.

On new Windows, such as Windows 11, there was a bug in Rterm as I 
reported in the other email, fixed now. The output on my Windows 10 was:

x? y, x ? y; a? b, a ? b

So the characters pasted were missing, but the characters expressed via 
\u escapes were printed correctly. This was a problem between the 
windows console implementation used in cmd.exe/powershell and 
Rterm/getline. What is characteristic for these problems is that the 
behavior differs from when Rterm runs from the Windows Terminal 
application (or possibly Msys2 mintty/winpty/bash).

Message-ID: <b16750c6-f7ad-4399-9077-574ba3d06236@app.fastmail.com>

Dear all,

A new version of gsDesign (3.4.0) is now on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=gsDesign). gsDesign supports group sequential clinical trial design, largely as presented in Jennison and Turnbull (2000).

This version removes restrictions on conditional power calculations for interim test statistic and brings improvements on dependencies and lifecycle management. Please see the changelog (https://keaven.github.io/gsDesign/news/) for details.

Thanks,
-Nan

Subject: [R] intersection in data frame
Message-ID: <CAEJRAFaCUdRjCd6hXjs=0Z0pjw92j1yiZxPj5hLJeX5TmVOvgQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dears,

i need to create from a column of observations variables in a datafram like
this way:
example:
original:
ID    station  value
12      xy        15
12      xz        20
13       xy       16
13       xz       19

new df:

 ID      xy     xz
12      15     20
13      16     19

i have been looking around for examples, but i could not find any how to
change my df.
I would like to make regression analysis on the values from different
production stations, so my df is very huge.

Please help on finding the package, description or anything else could help.

Thank you in advance!

Best regards
Malo

Hi,

If you are game to use a tidy approach then you can use tidyr::pivot_wider()

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

x <- dplyr::tribble(
  ~ID, ~station,  ~value,
  12, "xy", 15,
  12, "xz", 20,
  13, "xy", 16,
  13, "xz", 19)

tidyr::pivot_wider(x,
                   names_from = station,
                   values_from = value)
#> # A tibble: 2 ? 3
#>      ID    xy    xz
#>   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1    12    15    20
#> 2    13    16    19

Cheers,
Ben

Hello,

To reshape from long to wide format, here are two options:


df1 <- 'ID    station  value
12      xy        15
12      xz        20
13       xy       16
13       xz       19'
df1 <- read.table(textConnection(df1), header = TRUE)


# base R
reshape(df1, direction = "wide", idvar = "ID", timevar = "station")
#>   ID value.xy value.xz
#> 1 12       15       20
#> 3 13       16       19

# tidyverse
tidyr::pivot_wider(df1, ID, names_from = station)
#> # A tibble: 2 ? 3
#>      ID    xy    xz
#>   <int> <int> <int>
#> 1    12    15    20
#> 2    13    16    19


This question is StackOverflow question [1].

Or if your data is really large, you can try data.table::dcast().

 > library(data.table)
 > dcast(ID ~ station, data = as.data.table(df1))
    ID xy xz
1: 12 15 20
2: 13 16 19

(Note: instead of `as.data.table()`, you can use `setDT` or create your 
object as a data.table in the first place.)

Hello, Oh Lord, yes, I had a function called "cat", with argument "j". 
That was very dumb.

Renaming function cat resolved the problem. I had lived with this 
problem too long---avoiding printing with cat altogether in this 
program. Thanks to all-----Bill, Iva, Jim, Erin, Andrew for help!
