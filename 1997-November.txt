Subject: R-beta: A vector of lists == Data Frame?
Message-ID: <199711021430.OAA128446@out2.ibm.net>

I hope a very basic R/S programming question is appropriate for this 
list...

I have a function which returns a list of several (named) numeric 
values characterising an event history for a person. I want to invoke 
the function many (1000) times and create a vector of these lists to 
represent the histories of a population.

At first, I thought that a data frame would be the appropriate way to 
store the whole population record. But upon some reading in "Modern 
Applied Statistics with S-plus" (Venables and Ripley, 1994) it seems 
that a data frame is more like a list of vectors (all of the same 
length) than a vector of lists.

What is the most common R/S idiom for creating a vector of lists and 
then adding new lists to it? To be more specific, if "CreatePerson" 
is a function that returns a list characterising that person, how do 
I implement the following pseudo-code in R

Person[ i ] <- CreatePerson( param1, param2 )

Where Person[ 1000 ] is a vector of lists of the type returned by the 
"CreatePerson" function? When I'm done, I want to do things like the 
following pseudo-code

Person[ j ]$Age <- Person[ j ]$Age + 1

or similar (actually, that particular piece of logic isn't 
necessarily one I'm likely to do).

Any guidance is appreciated as are suggestions for a text to 
supplement Venables and Ripley in learning this language from 
scratch.

As you observe, the focus in this kind of language is on "variables"
rather than on "cases".  I think that this is because statistics tends
to be about building models with collections of observations, rather
than answering queries about individual observations.  Many computations
in R/S take advantage of this variable/vector structure.

Trying to work using record-like ideas is at best awkward in S/R, and
it will probably be very inefficient.  When records are of fixed size,
you can get the same effect by using data frames, but you have to think
variable-wise rather than case-wise.

I think the reason that S has caught on among statisticians is that we
have been trained to think in terms on "modeling with variables".  It
seems like the most natural thing in world to us.  Similarly, MATLAB
users probably like MATLAB because they have been trained to see
everything as a matrix problem and this is the framework that MATLAB
presents.  It is always interesting to encounter someone from a different
background who doesn't see things the same way.

If you are really interested in casewise processing I would suggest
that XLispStat or some other Lisp/Scheme may be a better choice.

I have a program which is being feed a formula.  One of the terms in 
the formula is going to be r(variablename).  r just returns the 
original variable.

r <- function(x) x

The formula is something like 

rglm(y ~ x + r(Subject))

What I want to do is get access to the variable Subject directly.  Can 
anyone give me any suggestions for doing this?

Thanks

I would suggest you use a list of lists instead of a vector of lists. If as you 
say you are a real beginner in R/S (but obviously not to programming), are you 
aware of use of double brackets to get list elements? ie mylist[i] returns the 
element as a list of length one, almost always not what you want, which is 
mylist[[i]]. Given this, lists are pretty easy to use; in fact, you can do 
without vectors. As Ross Ihaka says, this would probably be more natural in 
Xlispstat or straight Lisp.

BTW To find out about R's object-oriented methods, you need help(class); 
help(object) draws a blank.

I'm sending this to the list because I'm interested in views re Ross' comment:

> Trying to work using record-like ideas is at best awkward in S/R and
> it will probably be very inefficient.

And yet StatSci do so love to peddle S-PLUS as object-oriented. An object 
Person, a constructor Person() and a holder for them, PersonList, is totally 
natural and efficient in a real object-oriented environment such as C++. Such 
objects would have to be implemented using the fundamental list construct within 
S/R. Is this really so inefficient? If so why?

Personally I think selling S-PLUS as object-oriented might be a prosecutable 
offence. It is object-added. (R is free: I don't care what it claims to be :-)

The only thing which must be enhanced is the
	strwidth(..)
function.

Here is a **very** cheap workaround for  `strwidth'
which makes legend "work" with expressions:

strwidth <- function(s, units="user", cex=NULL) {
 fudge <- 1
 if(!is.character(s)) {
	 if(is.expression(s)) {
	   ##-- Internal 'strwidth' should be enhanced for expressions !!!
	   ##-- The following is a CHEAP workaround !
	   ns <- length(se <- s); s <- character(ns)
	   for(i in 1:ns) s[i] <- paste(deparse(se[i]),collapse="")
	 } else stop("`s' must be `character' or `expression'")
	 fudge <- 0.6
 }
 fudge*.Internal(strwidth(s, pmatch(units, c("user", "figure", "inches")), cex))
}


E.g., the following example now works for me:

    ex12 <- expression(bar(x) == sum(over(x[i], n), i==1, n),
		       hat(x) == median(x[i], i==1,n))

    plot(1:10,1:10)
    legend(7,4, ex12, y.intersp = 2)

The terms() command contains some magic for doing this 
If you type
	R> Terms<-terms(y ~ x + r(Subject),specials="r")
the resulting terms object has an attribute "specials" 
	R> attr(Terms,"specials")$r
	[1] 3
which says that the third column of the model frame will contain the r()
term. Multiple terms are possible
        R> Terms<-terms(y ~ x + r(Subject)+r(Object),specials="r")
        R> attr(Terms,"specials")$r
	[1] 3 4

You may then want to remove the r() from the formula before calling
model.matrix().  This is a bit harder, but there is code in the survival4
package to do it.  The function untangle.specials() gives the position of
the r() in the right-hand side of the formula object, and the survival4
package contains a "[.terms" method that allows terms to be removed
	R> untangle.specials(Terms,"r")
	$vars
	[1] "r(Subject)" "r(Object)" 

	$terms
	[1] 2 3
	R> Terms<-Terms[-c(2,3)]
	R> Terms
	y ~ x
	attr(,"variables")
	list(y, x)
	attr(,"factors")
	  x
	y 0
	x 1
  and so on...

If you want to include the code for untangle.specials() in your own
package you should probably ask Terry Therneau for permission -- the
survival4 code is not GPL -- but I imagine he would be happy for it to be
used with acknowledgement. I wrote the "[.terms" method, so there's no
problem there.

I agree that all low-level tools to work with record-like strucures (in
particular lapply() are there).  But, suppose for example that you have
a variable number of measurements of a variable V for a number of
patients.  (Typical biostat problem.)  What you'd like to say is,

	``do something with V (e.g., plot it as a time series) for each
	  patient''

How can this be done in a simple and straightforward manner?  Also, how
can you e.g. get a vector with the average V for each patient (from a
list of lists)?

Btw, how do you store such data?

Hello R users,


This question might be already discussed before, I apologize

Simple... how can I do to include a figure in a latex document.
As I have already done in Splus, I tried this:

\begin{figure}
\special{psfile=gauss.ps .......}
\end{figure}

but it didn't work. Any help?
Thank you in advance.

PS: I let down the Mac and the MS Window platforms and I am back

I always use the epsfig packages, if it is not installed on your
system you can get it from CTAN.

I.e.,

\usepackage{epsfig}

in the preamble and then

\begin{figure}
\epsfig{file=gauss.ps,width=.......}
\end{figure}

Hope this helps,
Fritz

I've been using (Latex2e)

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

with h-w.ps created by save.plot() Remember to start with
x11(orientation='portrait'), or you get (some of?) the plots rotated.

(I don't know what the  \leavevmode is good for, AUCTeX inserts it
when I do 'C-c C-e figure')

Try viewing the eps file using Ghostview. Check that the ps file has
bounding boxes. Also if there is too much white space around the graphic
ask Ghostview to convert you R file into an eps file . It will trim much of
the white space by redefining the bounding box.
Then use the includegraphicx package in latex. It supersedes espf etc
This new package seems to work like a charm.

Good luck

Subject: R-beta: graphics: ``gamma correction'' -- state / feedback ?
Message-ID: <199711061908.UAA05479@sophie.ethz.ch>

In 'CHANGES' of 0.49, you find among "NEW FEATURES"

 o  There is a new graphical parameter "gamma" which is designed to
    let users apply a ``gamma'' correction for their graphics
    displays.  Most monitors produce a color intensity which is
    related to voltage by the equation
			intensity = voltage ^ gamma
    with gamma about 2.5 for most PC monitors.  A typical symptom
    of this non-linearity is that a colorwheel produced by
			piechart(rep(1,48), col=48)
    shows a marked over representation of the red, green and blue
    and blue primaries.  If this is the case try
			par(gamma=1/2.5)
    and redraw the color wheel.  Vary gamma till you have a "nice"
    spectrum.  This is experimental and feedback would be welcome.
	       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    (If this is useful we will do the same for postscript).
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

		(underlines "~~" by me).

- What is the state of this?  
- Is it still experimental?  
- Does it also work in postscript?
- Who of you R users has used it?  successfully?
- if yes, can you dig out a nice example of its use?

The main reason for my questions is that I am updating the online
documentation,  and I'd like to write something in (at least)
	?hsv   and   ?par

Thank you for your feedback!
{{If you are not one of R&R, 
  you also may e-mail to me alone, and I'll summarize to the list ..}}

(For 'R-help' readers:
	ESS := Emacs Speaks Statistics is the successor of "S-mode for Emacs"
 and its new version 5.0  will most probably be released (as NON-beta)
 after this weekend.)


Yes, with the very latest prerelease of last night (what a timely question!),
you can do
	C-u M-x R
and then speficy the command line arguments.

Hallo,
I have downloaded the new executable named exe.zip for windows 95 and I
replaced it with the old wersion.
I tried it and it worked wery well, but unintentionally i have changed the
size of the vector heap (to the memory setting) with the value 1000, and
now the application doesn't work!
I tried to delete all and reinstall but the resul is the same,
double-clicking on rsept.exe compare an error:
a window with an "X"
with a title "Application error: c:\stat\rsept\rsept.exe"
the message is "The instruction at 004b624c referenced memory at ffffffff.
The memory could not be read from. Click on OK to terminate the application."
I click to OK and compare a new window with an "X" with the message:
"This program executed an invalid operation and it will be terminated. If
the problem persists, must contact the program's supplier"
then I click on "details>>" button and the following compare:
RSEPT ha provoked an invalid page error in the
module RSEPT.EXE in 0137:004b624c.

What an excellent example of why configuring a program from inside a
program may not be such a good idea...

I *think* the way to proceed is 

a) start regedit (from the command box via the Start button)
b) save the registry to a file (*never* edit it directly, you'll risk
hurting yourself badly if you do)
c) make a backup of the registry file and edit it with your favourite
editor. Look for something that could be R's memory setting and set it
right (or delete that entry).
d) reload it from regedit. 

-- or just ensure that the machine has >1GB of virtual memory (evil
grin). 

Robert: There must be a way of detecting this situation at startup?

  R sets two variables in the registry. They are under HKEY_USERS/Software/
  NSize and VSize. You can delete these and then it should be fine.
  
  I agree with Peter's comments about software modifying itself to the
  point where it won't run. I am working on the memory issue right now
  and hope to come up with a solution that will allow R to restart with
  a smaller footprint if there isn't enough memory available. Probably
  I should also check to see if there is enough memory available to satisfy
  a user request. That said, these things seem to be very non-portable.

I have tried to install the leaps package in the  window95 version of R.
I used Microsoft Fortran powerstation to generate 
the .dll file of the fortran programs in the src dorectory
of the leaps package and put it under the lib directory of RSept. Then
I stored the leaps.R under the library directory of RSept, with two
additional commands in leaps.R (the .R extension was dropped):
library.dynam("leaps.dll")^M
provide(leaps)^M

When I invoked the leaps library, the R functions in the file
can be printed out. However, when I ran the function, say, leaps(...),
I got the error message something like the fortran function "makeqr" is not
in the load table.

Any suggestions on how to fix the problem?

  I am not familiar with the leaps library so I don't know what functions it
  uses. If it relies on internal R functions (I hope that you got the R version)
  then you need to get your fortran compiler to export those functions from
  the dll with the correct collection of underscores (in the correct places),
  for Watcom C to figure out how to link to them.
  
  I have only had luck using Watcom C linked to C so far (and even that
  has not been entirely successful as demonstrated by the state of survival4).
  Luke Tierney has been providing some very helpful info on this as he
  is currently working on dynamic loading for Xlisp-Stat.

He wrote:

But I haven't had time to do any of that.

Subject: R-beta: autoloading a required library
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.96.971117011450.9537A-100000@alpha.fuzzy.at>


I wanted to use the dist() function from the mva library in my own
library, so I put require(mva) in my files. When my library loads, a
message about "Autoloading ... mva" appears. But when I call dist() now
within my functions the message

Error in .C("dist", as.double(x), nrow(x), ncol(x), double(len),
as.integer(method)) : C/Fortran function not in load table 

appears.

After dyn.load("..._path_to_/mva.so") it works.

Is there something wrong with the autoloading process or should 
statements like `if (!is.loaded("dist")) {dynload("mva.so")}` be added to 
the functions of the mva library? Or is this problem due to a wrong setup
in my R (0.50a4)?

Subject: R-beta: Shared libraries on AIX
Message-ID: <m3u3dbu1u8.fsf@sade.uio.no>

I've installed R on AIX.  For starters, this did not work out of the
box.  I got the following error message:

        cd graphics; make
        gcc -g -I../include -c gdevice.c
In file included from /usr/include/sys/lockf.h:41,
                 from /local/gnu/lib/gcc-lib/rs6000-ibm-aix4.1.3.0/2.7.2.1/include/unistd.h:354,
                 from /usr/include/fcntl.h:156,
                 from ../include/Defn.h:54,
                 from gdevice.c:20:
/usr/include/sys/stat.h:92: parse error before `blkcnt_t'
/usr/include/sys/stat.h:92: warning: no semicolon at end of struct or union
/usr/include/sys/stat.h:107: parse error before `}'
make: 1254-004 The error code from the last command is 1.

Now, I commented out the line `#include <fcntl.h>' in `Defn.h', and
the compiling went fairly smooth.  That is, I got the following error
message:

        gcc -g -fpic -I/usit/spfs/math-u1/fredrigl/R-0.50-a4/include -c hclust.c
ld: 0711-327 WARNING: Entry point not found: __start
ld: 0711-244 ERROR: No csects or exported symbols have been saved.
make: 1254-004 The error code from the last command is 8.


Next, I want to dynamically load some shared libraries.  This is what
I do:

sp09 69>gcc -c -shared -o ar1sim.so ar1sim.c
sp09 70>R

R : Copyright 1997, Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka
Version 0.50 Alpha-4 (September 10, 1997)

> dyn.load("ar1sim.so")
Error in dyn.load(x) : unable to load shared library "/usit/spfs/math-u1/fredrigl/R/ar1sim.so"


Do anybody know what is wrong?  I would be very happy to find out.

As Robert said, the most likely problem is with marking functions for
export. The FORTRAN version of leaps does not use any internal R functions
(the C function may use pow_ii -- I can't remember), so that won't be a
problem.  You can use is.loaded() to see if a C/Fortran function is in the
load table, which is simpler than trying to call the function.

If you find out how to mark functions for export from a DLL and it still
doesn't work then another possibility is that Powerstation uses different
name mangling from what R expects (eg an underscore before or after the
function name). The symbol.F() function will tell you what R thinks the
name should be, and if you build a small, simple DLL and look at it with a
text editor you will find what the DLL thinks the function name is. 
Probably there's a better solution than using a text editor but I'm not up
on Windows programming.

VC++ includes a utility called DUMPBIN -- it may be in their fortran
distribution as well.

One potential problem is with the calling conventions. Watcom uses a
register based method that appears to be different from the optional
resgister-based one under MS. The default under MS is I think a stack
based convention. If the R .exe is compiled with default calling
conventions then it *may* work to have MS Fortran generate code for
regieter-based calls (there may be a flag you can set for that) but
I'm worried there may be more differences than argument passing, that
the conventions on who saves and restores other registers may be
different. If that is indeed the case then calls may appear to work in
some contexts but not in others.

It's probably something wrong with the setup, but I don't know what. It
seems to work in my installation of R which is roughly 0.50a4.

Does it work if you use library(mva) instead?  This should be identical
except that it gives an error if "mva" doesn't exist, rather than a
warning.

the same behavior.


Now I tried loading my library within a new .RData workspace and
everything worked, but only the first time I use this workspace. 
The second time i get:

.Dyn.libs was created the first time I used this workspace and contains
(immediatly after the second start of R):

Maybe this is the reason why "mva.so" did not get loaded. Does R forget to
clear ".Dyn.libs" on shutdown?

Umm, yes. I'd forgotten that particular bug.  The quick fix is to add

if (exists(".Dyn.libs")) .Dyn.libs<-NULL

to the startup file

The solution was to put .Dyn.libs in the System environment instead of the
Global environment so it doesn't get saved.  I believe this is fixed in
the next version of R, due out roughly now.

Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.3.95.971120154228.23860B-100000@io.uwinnipeg.ca>

Question for R users under unix:
Do you ever edit figs created by R using xfig or some other program?  I
tried to edit a figure with xfig (a program which I find quite horrible by
the way) and it said it couldn't read it in.  I guess xfig has no
capability of reading postscript files?

Can anyone tell me how to do it, or perhaps suggest another freeware
structured drawing program for use in touching up postscript figs output
by R?

Thanks very much for any help.

My experience with xfig and R/Splus has been very good.  I do not know of 
any other freely available drawing programs that handle postscript/eps 
files as well as xfig, and export drawings in such a usefull variety of 
formats.

If you want to include a postscript file into an xfig drawing, first open 
a blank canvas to work on, then select the button on the left titled 
`picture object', which will bring a file-selector dialog from which you 
can select the ps/eps file you wish to import (after indicating the size 
for the imported file by use of the mouse).  It is usually that easy.

I recommend converting the ps image to an eps (encapsulated post script) 
with a tool such as ps2epsi (included with ghostscript, I believe), which 
removes much of the white space around the plot that is usually left when 
the plot is written to a ps file.

Good luck.  (The man page, though a little disorganized, is a good resource)

Bill: I know of no general way whatever of editing a PostScript file except
by opening it in a text editor and using your grey matter (no more than you
can expect to modify any program by sending its output to some
viewer/editor).

Only if R's PS graphics output has a very well defined and rigid structure
could you expect that to be possible, I think, and I never heard of a
program which could do such a thing.

You could always convert the PS to one of the bitmap formats (using e.g.
ghostscript) and try editing the bitmap with one of a number of suitable
programs, but that doesn'r sound like a happy way to spend the day.

A better option, if it is possible, would be to output an R graphic as a
"pic" file (preprocessor to [g]troff, which can then be used to generate PS
output). "Pic" files are easy to edit once you've got the hang of it;
but you can lose a number of PostScript's capabilities if you're
restricted to "pic" (e.g. shading arbitrary closed areas). To implement
this, I suppose "pic" would have to be one of R's graphics device drivers.

(Tony Dusoir's "SC" program uses pic as the primary graphics output format,
mediated through the "grap" language; the resulting "pic" file is displayed
using "troff | ghostscript" on screen, and can be converted to a PS file. It
seems to work quite well. "Pic" is also one of the device options in
gnuplot, so the gnuplot code could be used as a model if needed).

Hope this helps,
Ted.

We have had a lot of success editing figures from Splus (and R should be no 
different here) with xfig using the pstoedit program which is able to convert 
postscript to a range of editable formats, including fig but also I think 
various things which might be usable in the commercial drawing packages.  
You'll have to search the 'net for a source of this program as I can't find a 
location in the source packet I have here but I seem to remember that it 
wasn't hard to find.

pstoedit proved invaluable in fixing up Splus's plotting bugs (leaving out 
lines or tickmarks) and augmenting figures for a recent textbook project. We 
can't imagine life without it now!

Er - horrible compared to what? (Just curious. Personally, I've found
it a bit tedious, but it's hard to think up how to achieve similar
functionality with a better user interface. It's not a paint program,
but that is part of the design: that identifiable elements can be
selected and moved about.)

As others have pointed out, once the postscript is generated, it is
not easy to fix. 

For that other language which is not entirely unlike R, there has for
quite a while existed a graphics device which outputs in xfig's native
format, which you can then modify and convert to PostScript. Written
by me some 6 years ago and revised (and substantially improved) by
Gary Houston a year or two back. 

Once the structure of a generic graphics driver for R has
materialized, it should be fairly easy to cook up an R driver for the
xfig format (in particular since it won't necessarily have to deal
with the same idiosyncracies in the underlying graphics code). Perhaps
it's easy to do it already - I haven't been looking too closely at
the current graphics drivers.

The abovei, of course, is *one* of the ways to convert PostScript into a
bitmap prior to editing the bitmap with Xfig (Xfig calls on ghostscript for
the conversion, and for this ghostscript must be compiled to include the
"gif8" (for mono) and/or "pbmraw" (for colour) drivers; otherwise it won't
work at all; mine doesn't with B+W graphs, presumably because it doesn't
have gif8, even though it does have pbmraw.) Then, of course, if it works
you could make changes using Xfig and re-export as PS (using Xfig to
convert the bitmap to PS -- which, since it's PS representing bitmap, leads
to big files).

I still think that a more direct approach (e.g via "pic") would be better.

Best wishes to all,
Ted.

Subject: R-beta: questions from a beginner
Message-ID: <199711210216.UAA116484@saluki-mail.siu.edu>


I am new to R and I was wondering if I could ask a few questions. 
(I am running R on a Windows NT box.) 

1. Is the random number generator in R the same as the one in S 
"Super-Duper")? 
2. Is it possible to use dyn.load in the Windows version? 
3. When is the next release of R coming out? 

Thanks a lot. Best,

                                                          Francisco

Are there anybody at all that use R on IBM RS 6000 machines running

successfully (I think) managed to install R, however I cannot figure
out how to `dyn.load' external C functions.  Any help will be
appreciated.

Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.3.95.971121091155.26530B-100000@io.uwinnipeg.ca>

Thanks very much everyone for the helpful replies!

In answer to some questions.
Here is the background I am coming from.  On the Mac I routinely create
structured (vector) drawings (totally different from bitmaps!) with
something like a graphing program (e.g. Kaleidagraph) or R, then edit with
a structured drawing program (e.g. MacDraw, or Canvas [which does both
vector and bitmap reps]).  The file format used on Mac is pict.

So when I say xfig is horrible, I mean compared to ancient Mac structured
drawing software like MacDraw (circa 1988).  The xfig user interface
sucks. It is not at all like the structured drawing software people in the
Mac and Windows worlds use, and in this case the Mac and Windows worlds
are better.

If you don't make structured drawings, I guess that is because you're a
statistician rather than a scientist.  Scientists often have to make
diagrams of apparatus, etc.  A structured drawing program is also useful
for touching up graphs, etc.

Gimp is a bitmap oriented program.  xfig is for structured drawings.
Bitmaps look jaggy when printed.  Structured drawings use the maximum
printer resolution.  There other distinctions.  You can erase a bit of a
bitmap line.  In a structured drawing, the line is an object and you have
to erase the whole thing.  You can't align or group parts of a bitmap.
You can with objects in a structured drawing.

I will try the suggestions about changing the .ps file into something xfig
can read.  I will also look at the alternative suggested programs.  Thanks
again!

Is it possible to run R soley from the shell?  

I'm evaluating necessary fixes to R and XLispStat (and eventually SAS
and S-PLUS 4) for running as subprocesses to Emacs (NTEmacs) for ESS.

Currently, I lose control of R when running via Emacs; is it possible
to "remove" the windows?  (all, or all but the graphics window)?

It's fairly easy to do a straight "DOS" compile of R, if you drop
*all* the Windows stuff. Tried that stunt with a cross-compile from
Linux/gcc (in which case, even the makefiles work). Starting from Unix
sources, there were (essentially) only a few pieces of "X-orcism" needed
and one or two difficulties with nonexisting math functions and
addresses of functions defined as macros. How to get the graphics
window back is an exercise for the reader....

different settings of the memory and ran into the same problems as did
Rossetti and solved them as suggested by Gentleman, but I can't make it

As an Linux and TeX-user Ipe-5.0 (http://www.cs.ust.hk/~otfried or
ftp://ftp.cs.ruu.nl/pub/mirror/ipe) serves me very well. It can reimport
postscript files via an ghostscript script and allows to use all
the LaTeX formatting capabilities.

I am the provider of this link.
The reason that it look so up-to-date is that it __IS__ more recent
than almost anything: It is based on a daily mirror of the inofficial
source code in Auckland.
It used to be the HTML version of help for the latest __released__
version of R.  However, since that is so old currently, I switched to provide
the above...

One of my own priorities as member of the R-core team actually _is_ the
accuracy and usefulness of (online) documentation...

[[ ---> Hint, hint:  
		If you find inaccuracies,
		if you have nice examples exhibiting features of R
		functions,....
 you could also e-mail them to me if you don't want to send it to  
 R-devel at ...  which would otherwise be the appropriate place.

I don't think that this really makes sense.
The current documentation documents features which are not in the currently
released code...

You didn't say which version of R you are using;

It is true that  0.50-a4 still doesn't properly work with these.
However, I though Windows "Rsept" was somewhat newer...

Anyway, in current source (unreleased) version, it's all nice :

Does anyone else's mailer refuse to process messages from r-help in
"quoted-printable" encoding?  Pine 3.92 barfs on the
r-help banner added to the end of the message, because the
banner uses 'minus' and 'equals' in a repeating pattern.
Since 'equals' is the 'escape' character for quoted-printable
encoding, it should only appear as the lead-in to an encoded octet
or a <CR><LF> pair.  The 'equal' 'minus' pair _can_ be used
in a multipart delimiter, so perhaps that was the intention
and the 'multipart' header is getting trashed somewhere.

Save workspace image? [y/n/c]:

- but I'm pretty sure an *earlier* one (0.49?) did do Latin1. How
about adding this to your set of regression tests, so that it becomes
possible to detect whenever the source tree gets modified?

And BTW, yes, your message became "malformed quoted printable" because
of the =-=- pattern in the footer. May I suggest we quietly change "="
to "+" or "~" (while equally quietly cursing the MIME standard mess...)

Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.3.93.971126104055.22998A-100000@alpha2-stat.sci.uni-klu.ac.at>


Currently I'm porting the spatial library from 

"Venables W.N., Ripley, B.D.  (1995): Modern applied statistics with S-PLUS,
Springer" 

to R. Now it seems to work with R-0.50-a4, but I guess it has to be adjusted
when R 0.60 comes out. 

So my questions are:

What changes will appear in library sources (directories, Makefile, help
page format)?

Can I get an unofficial pre-version of R 0.60 (where)? When will it
replace version 0.50? 

Thanks

Subject: R-beta: Memory Management in R-0.50-a4
Message-ID: <347D530F.C9D9AAD@stams.strath.ac.uk>

Dear R users

we're having a problem reading a largish data file using
read.table().  The file consists of 175000 lines of 4
floating pt numbers. Here's what happens:

> dat_read.table('sst.dat')
Error: memory exhausted

(This is line 358 of src/main/memory.c).

Cutting down the file to around 15000 lines allows
read.table() to work OK.

I edited the memory limits in Platform.h and re-compiled
and now read.table() can manage up to around 125000 lines.

#define R_VSIZE 30000000L       /* 15 times original figure (Defn.h) */
#define R_NSIZE  1000000L       /* 5 times original figure (Defn.h) */
#define R_PPSSIZE 100000L       /* 10 times original figure (Defn.h) */

Clearly I can keep upping these values until it works, but has
the side-effect of making the running R binary pretty big.

What can I do? Is the answer a better memory management
system ?

Any help appreciated.

Yours

Ian

The first two of those are settable via command line options, e.g.

R -v 50 

should get you a 50M memory heap.

That wouldn't hurt, but... The actual numbers require only about 6M of
storage, so the real trouble is only there during the read.table. What
you could do is to read the data (in a Large process), save it to a
binary file and read that into a smaller process.

Another thing you could do is to switch to reading the values with
scan(). Read.table() is trying to be intelligent about data types and
soforth, which tends to make it inefficient on large data sets.

I just wanted to thank everyone again.

I got idraw and pstoedit installed.

idraw is a lot like MacDraw so I am happy now.

The combination works just as I wanted:
create fig with R
pstoedit -f idraw fig.ps fig.idraw
edit fig with idraw

Note the fig is not just rendered as a bitmap, but you can select objects
and edit (e.g. select text and change font size).

  I'm afraid I need a bit more info than this to be able to help. What 
  version of Windows are you using? Can you provide the exact details of
  an example where abline fails? (nb. when posting bugs it's important to
  be as specific as possible about the situation).
  
  There will be a function that is similar to Unix time but it will be limited
  to the timing functions available in Ansi C. This should be in my hoped for
  release of RDec (we've just been going over the completed changes to the 
  parser and the graphics, my new machine is here and setup so things look 
  hopeful for a Dec. release of the equivalent of 0.60; of course its summer and 
  the surfs up so I can't really promise)

"read.table" uses vast amounts of memory.  First it reads everything
as as string and then converts to numbers.  By using "scan" instead
you can cut down your memory demands.  If you know you have exactly
175000 observations using something like

	x <- scan(what=list(0,0,0,0), nmax=175000)

you will cut you memory demands to near the minimum.

The memory management definitely needs some work (well actually it
needs a quick bullet between the eyes).  When we got started on R we
didn't anticipate that it would be see much use outside of teaching
here at Auckland.

I certainly have plans to revisit the memory management at some point
and to look at some of the scalability problems too.  But don't hold
your breath ...

To whom it may concern,
		
	I have tried to compile the package R-0.50-4 on a Linux platform.
However, while making 'dataentry.c' I got an error message according to
'dataentry.h' saying diverse "X11/ " header files are missing (e. g.
X11.). I would be very grateful if you informed me where and in which
distribution one can find that header files. Another question: can I use R
without X terminal? If yes how can I configure this? I found a variable
X_DISPLAY_MISSING in the 'configure' file. If it is set to 1, will be X
disabled?

Currently, no. It used to work (almost), but the conditionalization in
the source got removed at some point. It's not too hard to strip out
the offending bits by hand, but it may be easier simply to install the
relevant X headers and libraries. It will *run* OK without the
X-display (minus the graphics windows, of course)

In the longer run, we should get that put back in, since it is also
needed for cross-platform development if we are to maintain a unified
source tree.
