Dear R-help members

Since this morning (5/2/2025), I get an error when I try to load optimx 
package. I solve it and I send my solution but if someone has a better 
idea or understand what's happened, I will be most happy to know.

MacOSX 15.3

R 4.4.2

nlopt installed using
brew install nlopt

Here are the steps to produce the error and a solution to solve it. Some 
parts are in French. I don't know how to "ask" to R to not use French 
for some system messages.

Hi,

That looks like the dependency on nlopt for nloptr (used by several of the
solvers) was somehow missing. There is SUPPOSED to be a check of what is installed
and a warning issued, but possibly one got missed. Even some base packages
do sometimes need the external libraries manually installed, and I find I'm
doing that after various OS updates or resets when the long term support
runs out.

Some updates and minor extensions to optimx, mostly convenience features or
checks that dependencies available, are on the github version, which is a bit
ahead of CRAN (https://github.com/nashjc/optimx). I find doing all the checks
and revdeps for the package now getting heavy enough that it is worth waiting
a bit unless there's a critical bug, which I don't think there has been for
a long while.

I don't have a Mac, and am currently away from home (actually in Nice, FR for
a couple of weeks), but would be interested in knowing if the github version
needs an independent install of nlopt on Mac, or indeed on any platform.

Cheers,

John Nash
maintainer, optimx

I think the operative words here are "brew install". I.e., this is a homebrew installation, and thus nothing to do with CRAN.

Nothing wrong with homebrew as far as R Core and the CRAN team knows, we just don't support it, so you have to hope for response from other homebrew users.

Subject: [R] Looking for simple line-splitting code
Message-ID: <cc02f160-3147-4bfc-89d0-21c5633cbbc5@gmail.com>

If I have this object:

   x <- c("abc\ndef", "", "ghi")

and I write it to a file using `writeLines(x, "test.txt")`, my text 
editor sees a 5 line file:

   1: abc
   2: def
   3:
   4: ghi
   5:

which is what I'd expect:  the last line in the editor is empty.  If I 
use `readLines("test.txt")` on that file, I get the vector

   c("abc", "def", "", "ghi")

and all of that is fine.

What I'm looking for is simple code that modifies x to the `readLines()` 
output, without actually writing and reading it.

My first attempt doesn't work:

   unlist(strsplit(x, "\n"))

because it leaves out the blank line 3.  I can fix that with this ugly code:

   lines <- strsplit(x, "\n")
   lines[sapply(lines, length) == 0] <- list("")
   lines <- unlist(lines)

Surely there's a simpler way to do this?  I'd like to use just base 
functions, no other packages.

Hello,

Use ?textConnection.
The 5th line is left out, just like in your code.


x <- c("abc\ndef", "", "ghi")
x |> textConnection() |> readLines()
# [1] "abc" "def" ""    "ghi"


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

This also seems to work:

Surely there's a simpler way to do this?? I'd like to use just base

Thanks to Rui, Peter and Tanvir!  Peter's seems to be the fastest of the 
3 suggestions so far on the little test case, but on the real data 
(where x contains several thousand lines), Rui's seems best.

What does 

     kpsewhich inconsolata.sty

(on the command line) say?  (It should show the
location of the file.)

The 'Installation and Administration' manual briefly
discusses how to build the manual for a package, also
without 'inconsolata':

A 3rd option could be

scan(text=x, what="", blank.lines.skip=FALSE)

(all because readLines() doesn't obey the text=x convention, perhaps it should? I'm unsure whether the textConnection is left open in Rui's method.)

<SNIP>

Apologies for muddying the waters with my ignorance, but why would you
expect a 5 line file?   I would expect a 4 line file, and that is
indeed what I get when I try the code in question.

If I append an empty line at the end of my test.txt and then
apply readLines() to that file, I get [1] "abc" "def" ""    "ghi" "",
again as *I* would expect.

What am I missing?  Sorry for being a thicko.

cheers,

Rolf

No, it is not left open. Use ?showConnections to check it.


x <- c("abc\ndef", "", "ghi")

x |> textConnection() |> readLines()
showConnections()

# this creates and opens a connection
tc <- textConnection(x)
showConnections()
readLines(tc)
showConnections()
close(tc)
showConnections()


Hope this helps,

That fifth line is more a function of the editor (RStudio) than the 
file.  The last line ends with a newline.  The editor shows this by 
including a blank 5th line.  If the last line just stopped at the last 
letter, the editor would display it as a 4 line file.

Hi,

using the library "stringi" allows this:

[1] "abc" "def" ""    "ghi"

Subject: [R] pairs plot
Message-ID: <Z6QtQcmXeTvs8Ck7@iastate.edu>

According to the help for pairs, the diag.panel function is supposed to
take a panel.hist as in:

 pairs(USJudgeRatings[1:5], panel = panel.smooth,
           cex = 1.5, pch = 24, bg = "light blue", horOdd=TRUE,
           diag.panel = panel.hist, cex.labels = 2, font.labels = 2)

Error: object 'panel.hist' not found

I know that this used to work in the past so I wonder if this was changed and the documentation was not corrected.
Anyway, what is the current way of doing this?

Many thanks and best wishes,
Ranjan

Possibly because:
panel.hist is not an existing R function -- you have to first create
it so pairs() can use it. ?pairs shows you how in the Help examples,
i.e.

panel.hist <- function(x, ...)
{
    usr <- par("usr")
    par(usr = c(usr[1:2], 0, 1.5) )
    h <- hist(x, plot = FALSE)
    breaks <- h$breaks; nB <- length(breaks)
    y <- h$counts; y <- y/max(y)
    rect(breaks[-nB], 0, breaks[-1], y, col = "cyan", ...)
}

Cheers,
Bert

Function panel.hist is only defined in the example section of pairs.

Subject: [R] install.packages and package dependencies
Message-ID: <CAEO2kuJfzGdeQOFKKPcyJbzct_5oOy178Ss1tsnbaYboA2xyNA@mail.gmail.com>

It appears that install.packages does not automatically install package
dependencies when the package is installed via a URL. As an example, here
is what I get when I attempt to install the latest ggplot2 tarball via its
URL on CRAN:

> install.packages("
https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/ggplot2_3.5.1.tar.gz")
inferring 'repos = NULL' from 'pkgs'
trying URL 'https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/ggplot2_3.5.1.tar.gz'
Content type 'application/x-gzip' length 3604371 bytes (3.4 MB)
==================================================
downloaded 3.4 MB

ERROR: dependencies ?cli?, ?glue?, ?gtable?, ?isoband?, ?lifecycle?,

had non-zero exit status
>

Is there a parameter I can give to install.packages so that it will
automatically install all the packages the package (in this example
ggplot2) needs? I've read the documentation of install.packages several
times, and am confused by the interplay of the various parameters. When I
type getOption('repos') I get:

                       CRAN
"https://cran.rstudio.com/"
attr(,"RStudio")
[1] TRUE

Without this it looks like installing from a URL is a 2-step process:

install.packages(c(<packages the package needs>))
install.packages("<url of package tarball>")

I am aware that there are some contributed packages (such as devtools and
remotes) that do this for you in a single line. But I am curious whether
this is possible via install.packages alone.

I don't think install.packages() can do what you want.  If you are 
specifying a URL, then install.packages() assumes it has no way to know 
where the other dependencies are supposed to come from.

The typical way I install an unusual version of a package is to install 
the CRAN version first (install.packages("ggplot2") will do that, and 
will get all the deps), then reinstall the special version, and hope 
I've got all the right dependencies.

This is about LaTeX install and not about R.  My problem was multiple installations of LaTeX: first using MacTex, then newer version using texlive.  I had also tried to install then uninstall using MacPorts.  It seems MacPorts uninstall was not clean.  I had to manually delete several sym links.  MacTex install inserts /etc/paths.d/TeX, which has the path /Library/TeX/texbin.  So to get TeX to use the more recent texlive install, PATH should be updated so that texlive comes before /Library/TeX/texbin.

With above corrections, my problem is solved.

This might help some other users:
1.  Check tex installation.  Multiple installs using different methods (MacTex, MacPorts, texlive using perl) can interfere with one another.
2.  Ensure that, in PATH variable, desired tex installation comes first.
3.  Verify that different tex family commands use the same tex installation.  For example, tlmgr - - version, tex - - version, should both point to the same installation.

Subject: [R] Unexpected result after auto-attaching of the Matrix package
Message-ID: <7560a90d-2662-4673-97ec-6cca47137044@gmx.net>

Dear all,

I just stumbled on this behavior - not sure if this is expected:

R version 4.4.2 (2024-10-31) -- "Pile of Leaves"
Copyright (C) 2024 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu

 > library(Matrix)

 > d <- readRDS("~/Downloads/sparsemat_test.rds")
 > class(d)
[1] "dgCMatrix"
attr(,"package")
[1] "Matrix"
 > dim(d)
Loading required package: Matrix
NULL
 > dim(d)
[1] 10 10

So the first call to dim(d) loads/attaches the Matrix package but
returns NULL for the call. Only the second call to dim returns the
correct results. I would expect the first call to succeed also,
otherwise what is the purpose of loading the package?

Best regards

Hilmar

Why aren't you loading the package before you load the object that assumes the relevant methods for that object are available?

Do you set this value somewhere (via an environment variable or start
up file)?  Or is it this value because you use RStudio as IDE?

If you use RStudio, please be aware that RStudio has its own version of
install.packages():

RStudio> install.packages
function (...) 
.rs.callAs(name, hook, original, ...)
<environment: 0x12a530f00>

So if you are using RStudio, you will have to talk with Posit about
changing the behaviour of install.packages().

If you want the behaviour of utils::install.packages() to change, I am
sure that R-Core will consider any diff that implements the
new/improved behaviour. :-)

Cheers,

Here's what happens here:

1. .Primitive("dim") considers dispatching a dim() method:
https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/fa73948a1977da05788499807469e69d5a21bd98/src/main/attrib.c#L1181
2. DispatchOrEval() first considers S4 dispatch:
https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/fa73948a1977da05788499807469e69d5a21bd98/src/main/eval.c#L4152
3. But then R_has_methods(dim) finds out that no S4 methods are
currently registered for dim() - Matrix not being loaded yet - and S4
dispatch is abandoned:
https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/fa73948a1977da05788499807469e69d5a21bd98/src/main/objects.c#L1578
4. Instead, R tries usemethod(...) for S3 dispatch:
https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/fa73948a1977da05788499807469e69d5a21bd98/src/main/eval.c#L4215
5. UseMethod() wants to find out the S3 class vector for 'd' and calls
R_data_class2():
https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/fa73948a1977da05788499807469e69d5a21bd98/src/main/objects.c#L493
6. R_data_class2() sees it's an S4 object and calls
methods:::.extendsForS3(class(d)), which finally loads Matrix in order
to find out classes extended by "dgCMatrix":
https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/fa73948a1977da05788499807469e69d5a21bd98/src/main/attrib.c#L840
https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/fa73948a1977da05788499807469e69d5a21bd98/src/main/attrib.c#L736-L741
7. S3 dispatch fails for all those S4 classes or the "default" method,
so dim(d) returns attr(d, "dim") (which is not set):
https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/fa73948a1977da05788499807469e69d5a21bd98/src/main/attrib.c#L1184

Then why does print(d) work without loading Matrix first?
print.default() internally performs S4 dispatch after Matrix was loaded
by R_data_class2() on step (6) above.

So while Matrix is not being loaded by accident in your example, things
are not set up to load the packages containing S4 classes
automatically. It could become a feature request for DispatchOrEval()
to ensure that the the package owning the S4 class is loaded before
trying to dispatch an S4 method, although it could be challenging to
implement while avoiding additional slowdowns.

Duncan and Berwin,

Thank you for your help.

I really wanted confirmation from someone more experienced than me that I
wasn't missing something. It looks like there is no way to do this in one
line in base R, and that's fine.

For reference, the packages that I am doing this for are acs and
choroplethr, both of which were archived today. (choroplethr depends on
acs, and acs was archived due to a NOTE. I was the maintainer of
chroplethr).

I believe that at least a few people will still want to use choroplethr, at
least for a little while. The instructions I have posted on this are
consistent with what I wrote above for:

# Install binary versions of acs' dependencies, then install acs from source
acs_imports = c("stringr", "XML", "plyr", "httr")
install.packages(acs_imports)
install.packages("
https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/acs/acs_2.1.4.tar.gz")

# Install binary versions of choroplethr's dependencies, then install
choroplethr from source
choroplethr_imports = c("Hmisc", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "R6", "WDI", "ggmap",
"RgoogleMaps", "tigris", "gridExtra", "xml2", "tidyr", "tidycensus",
"testthat", "choroplethrMaps", "choroplethrAdmin1")
install.packages(choroplethr_imports)
install.packages("
https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/choroplethr/choroplethr_3.7.3.tar.gz
")

I believe that both the remotes and devtools packages have functions that
can do this in one line of code. But I believe that they install all the
dependencies from source. I found that there were intermittent failures
with that (not in the acs or choroplethr packages, surprisingly). And also
it was substantially slower (319 seconds for devtools' install_version vs.
43 seconds for the code I showed above).

Berwin, your post actually made me chuckle. In the original draft of my
post I wrote something like "I tried to look at what install.packages does
by typing 'install.packages' but it shows me something I can't understand:

> install.packages
function (...)
.rs.callAs(name, hook, original, ...)
<environment: 0x118030cc0>"

I am indeed using RStudio and I had no idea that they overwrote that
function!

Maybe it would be an option for you to adopt and fix the NOTE for "acs"?

Its CRAN page (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=acs) conveys that the 
original acs author will not keep on maintaining it. But the problems seem 
like they can be addressed without too much effort. Then you could bring 
back both acs and choroplethr.

Best wishes,
Achim

Subject: [R] Reverse dependency checking
Message-ID: <BN7PR04MB3844887EF21A85E8017F52BAF1FC2@BN7PR04MB3844.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>

Dear R-Help,

When I submit an update to one of my packages, I decided to try to avoid having to fix errors that sometimes occur in CRAN's reverse-dependency checks by performing the same checks ahead of time. From what I can tell, the way to do this is to use

    tools::check_packages_in_dir(..., reverse = list(which = "all"), ...)

It does not surprise me that this takes a lot of time! One of my packages has quite a few reverse suggests, so this process installs all packages that my package or any of the reverse depends requires, which is about a zillion. But eventually, this works. I've learned to run this in batch mode so it doesn't tie up Rgui or RStudio. That's fine; I just have a script that I can run.

I have two questions:

1. While it is installing all those packages, I see a lot of chatter so I can see what progress is being made, however glacial. But when it gets the the phase where it checks each of the reverse-dependent packages, it is utterly silent. It would be really helpful to me if check_packages_in_dir() would just print a one-line message that it is checking such-and-such package.

2. Is there any way to streamline the checking? It seems to me that since all the packages are already on CRAN and thus pass most checks, all that we need to check for reverse dependencies are the examples, vignettes, and tests. This could save a lot of time.

Thanks

You may also want to try the recheck container + github action, which
runs the recheck process on public infrastructure:

There are several re-implementations of that code.  Jeroen pointed you 
to one, I think devtools has another.  You should try those.

I think there can't be.  You may have dropped some export, or changed 
its behaviour.  Even suggested packages can be used anywhere (with tests 
that they are installed), so your changes could conceivably have bad 
effects in lots of strange ways. There are probably a few of the checks 
that could be dropped, but not most of them.

   For what it's worth I use https://github.com/r-lib/revdepcheck (see 
also https://revdepcheck.r-lib.org/ ) ... it has some of its own warts, 
but it has a very informative progress bar.

Dear? Ivan,

thanks a lot for the detailed analysis. This is excellent? and answers
my question. Unfortunately it is difficult to find any documentation on
this topic.

I now understand this is not a formal library? auto-loading feature.

What I still see as problematic is that in this way one can get two
different results when trying to access the? same object in the same?
way,? without any error or warning message.

Thanks again!

Best regards

Hi Jeff,

you are obviously right and I would usually load packages before, but in
this case it was a saved R object that I had not created, and therefore
did not know what to expect.

I was prepared to get an error message, but not getting an error or at
least a warning and then getting the wrong result was kind of unexpected.

Best regards

Hilmar

Ari,

There were multiple errors in the acs package. If CRAN states that the maintainer abandoned it, that is what happened. Had you reached out to Ezra Glenn (cc-ed here) and offered to help keep the package maintained, this hiccup need not have happened. 

The three problems were:

1) stale URLs using http: not https:, of which some are dead (locally changed to https:, so reported as such):

Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs:
  URL: https://dusp.mit.edu/faculty/ezra-glenn
    From: DESCRIPTION
    Status: 404
    Message: Not Found
  URL: https://eglenn.scripts.mit.edu/citystate/
    From: DESCRIPTION

    Status: 403
    Message: Forbidden
  URL: https://factfinder2.census.gov
    From: man/read.acs.Rd
    Status: Error
    Message: libcurl error code 28:

  URL: https://www.bls.gov/cpi/
    From: man/cpi.Rd
    Status: 403
    Message: Forbidden

2) multiple uses of class() == "string" - class() may return a vector of length > 1, so for some years it has been required that inherits() be used, to permit the test to succeed even when the required class is not first. This was discussed in 2019 in https://blog.r-project.org/2019/11/09/when-you-think-class.-think-again/index.html

3) The first lines of configure and cleanup were #! /bin/bash - see https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-ints.html#index-_005fR_005fCHECK_005fBASHISMS_005f for why this isn't robust (for example macOS doesn't use bash as its default shell, and maybe might not work correctly.

I would think that CRAN approached the maintainer multiple times over a period of many months to clear these inconsistencies. You assert elsewhere that if it worked before, you might expect it to continue to work. However, things like failing a class test because some upstream package has re-ordered the class vector have become more of a problem as the CRAN package count has grown, not necessarily for this package but in general, so that rules are tightened in the light of experience. 

I attach separately for the direct addressees a corrected version of the package as far as I can go, since for the failing URLs, it isn't very clear what to do.

I would suggest that you, Ari, are best placed to offer to take over the package, meaning that as soon as you get a fixed version of acs to CRAN, you can re-submit your valued choroplethr to CRAN and be a bit better future-proofed. Since you do use github, I'd suggest using an acs repo there and running CI both for acs and for choroplethr using the acs on github. That would give you advance notice of possible rule tightening in R-devel.

Hope this helps,

Roger

Apparently not just to Roger...sorry for spamming the entire list!

In any case, I hope really do hope that this helps to resolve the issue.

Ari, let us know if we can help with anything else.

Subject: [R] How to specify a quadratic term in the contrast function
Message-ID: <DM6PR03MB50493366E682A39396493C84E2FA2@DM6PR03MB5049.namprd03.prod.outlook.com>

I am using the contrast package to produce contrasts from a glm model that contains a quadratic term:
fit0 <- glm(y ~ x + I(x*x),data=mydata)
I would like to know how to specify the quadratic term, I(x*x), in the contrast function.
When I try to use 
contrast(fit0,list(x=4))
I receive an error message;
#Error in generateData(fit = list(coefficients = c(`(Intercept)` = 0.5262645536229,  :not enough factors
When I try to use 
contrast(fit0,list(x=4,I(x*x)=16))
I receive an error message:
#Error: unexpected '=' in "contrast(fit0,list(x=4,I(x*x)="
Other variants of the call to contrast including
contrast(fit0,list(x=4,"x*x"=16)) and
contrast(fit0,list(x=4,"I(x*x}"=16))
produce similar error messsages.

Please see my code below.

if (!require(contrast)) install.packages("contrast")
library(contrast)
help(contrast)

x <- 1:100
y <- x + x^2 + rnorm(1)
mydata <- data.frame(x=x,y=y)

fit0 <- glm(y ~ x + I(x*x),data=mydata)
summary(fit0)

contrast(fit0,list(x=4))
#Error in generateData(fit = list(coefficients = c(`(Intercept)` = #0.5262645536229,  :  not enough factors

contrast(fit0,list(x=4,I(x*x)=16))
#Error: unexpected '=' in "contrast(fit0,list(x=4,I(x*x)="

Thank you,
John

   Looking at the 'contrasts' function, it seems to be imported from 
'rms' and to take only 'rms'-type fits (which are different from base-R 
[g]lm() fits) as input.

   I'm not sure exactly what contrasts you're trying to generate, but I 
would probably use the emmeans package for the task, since it handles a 
wide range of model types.

  Alternately, you could use one of the modeling functions from rms, 
which should work with rms::contrast(), although I ran into trouble for 
some reason:

fit1 <- ols(y ~ x + I(x^2), data = mydata)

 > Error in if (!length(fname) || !any(fname == zname)) { :
   missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed

I guess rms handles I()-protected terms differently? (The model with 
just y~x didn't throw an error ...)

I don?t know if this will make a difference, but I believe it is generally preferred to use the poly() function (for lm()/glm()) or the pol() function (for rms functions) to include the quadratic (and higher order terms).

Subject: [R] Problems with package nlme
Message-ID: <670bb9907c6947a28d908423753920fe@geo.tu-darmstadt.de>

Hi,

I cannot any longer load a dataset fom the package nlme.
When I try to load the dataset RatPubWeight with the data() command, I get a warning (Warnmeldung: In data(RatPubWeight) : Datensatz 'RatPubWeight' nicht gefunden).

With data(package = "nlme") I can see that the dataset RatPubWeight is available in the package.

I'm using R version 4.4.2 and the package version nlme_3.1-166.

I spent quite an amount of time to overcome this problem but was not successful.

Thank you for your help,

Stephan Weinbruch

Subject: [R] Code \255 no longer working to produce a short dash in base R
 PDF graphs
Message-ID: <d1538b3e8f004dbeaa4b966937a43070@ndph.ox.ac.uk>

I make graphs, in large quantities, for perfectionists.

My bosses do not like the results of text like 'baseline-defined' in graphs; they feel that the resulting dash is too long.

For many years, I have been in the habit of producing graphs with shorter dashes as follows:

pdf("myfile.pdf")
plot(1, 10)
text(1, 11, "baseline\255defined")
text(1, 9, "done")
graphics.off()

They like that dash - but I never knew what it was called.

Recently work updated my PC to the latest version of Windows, and, perforce, I updated to the latest version of R (4.4.2).
(So I'm not sure which change caused my problem; in any case I cannot practically go back for either.)

The code above now fails, with the error message:
Error in text.default(1, 11, "baseline\xaddefined") : invalid input 'baseline> text(1, 9, "done")

I'm trying various Unicode values, currently settling on \U{2010}, but I'm getting complaints about the length of my dashes.
I'm no expert on fonts, and perhaps I've missed a Unicode value that would be perfect.

Is there a way to get back to what I had, without resorting to more complicated code, please?

Thank you for looking at my deeply obscure niche problem!

Subject: [R] Discrepancy in imputed data results across different operating
 systems
Message-ID: <3d2d60f87b0f4f399413d71fb634a91d@psy.lmu.de>

Hi,


I am currently facing an issue with data imputation in R using the random forest method from the MICE package. Specifically, I have imputed data that was missing completely at random (MCAR) using the following R code:


# IMPUTATION

set.seed(500)

# Perform multiple imputation

imputed_data <- mice(JPBR, m = 5, method = 'rf', maxit = 50)


Initially, I performed the imputation on a Mac running macOS Big Sur version 11.7.10 with R version 4.2.3.


However, when I attempted to replicate the results using the same seed, data, and script on a Windows 10 Enterprise machine with R version 4.4.1, the imputed results differed from those obtained on the Mac.


Concerned by this discrepancy, I ran the same script on another Windows 10 Enterprise system using R version 4.2.3. The results were consistent with the previous Windows imputation but still differed from the Mac results.


Furthermore, I conducted the imputation on a different Mac running macOS Sonoma with R version 4.4.1. Interestingly, the results from this setup matched the original imputation outcome from the Mac, suggesting that the issue may not be related to the R version but rather to the operating system.


I am seeking insights or suggestions on why these discrepancies occur and how to ensure consistent imputation results across different operating systems. Any guidance or advice would be greatly appreciated.


Best,


Johannes

Nowadays, the session encoding on appropriately new versions of Windows
is UTF-8 [*]. Previously, the native encoding of the R session
corresponded to the ANSI encoding of your computer, most likely CP1252.
Let's see what does \255 mean in that encoding:

iconv('\255', 'CP1252', '') |> utf8ToInt() |> as.hexmode()
# [1] "ad"

Does '\uad' work for you?

Normally I'd say you should post a reproducible example where you get a 
discrepancy, but that's already been done in an open bug report here:

This web page:  https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/category/Pd lists a 
lot of choices.  You didn't say what the complaints were ("too long"? 
"too short"?), so I can't recommend what to try other than \U{2010}, but 
there is a big variety of choices there.

Inside my pasted-together constructed titles, I have to use \u{ad}, but _that_ works perfectly.  Thank you very much indeed!

Hi,

I am working on a modelling project for Brazilian inflation, for which I am tempted to use the BVAR package in R. I read the paper and the documentation and yet I could not find any further information on how the values of the hyperparameters of the Minnesota prior (bv_lambda, bv_alpha, bv_psi) should be chosen. While testing the package, I am getting several bugs for which there is not enough information on how to fix, only the fact that the values of these hyperparameters are not correctly set up. I could not find anything online either, which is why I am sending this email. Is it possible you can help me?

Thank you,

Eduardo Olinto, JGP

It sounds like your first course of action should be to contact the package
maintainer. See ?maintainer or consult the Description file for the package
for their email.

Hi Dennis,

A quick Claude request:

"using r I have a sequence like:        1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15,
20I would like to display it as:        1, 3-5, 7-8, 12-15, 20"

yielded:

condense_sequence <- function(nums) {
  if (length(nums) == 0) return("")
  if (length(nums) == 1) return(as.character(nums))

  # Sort the numbers just in case they're not in order
  nums <- sort(unique(nums))

  # Initialize variables
  ranges <- vector("character")
  start <- nums[1]
  prev <- nums[1]

  for (i in 2:length(nums)) {
    if (nums[i] != prev + 1) {
      # End of a sequence
      if (start == prev) {
        ranges <- c(ranges, as.character(start))
      } else {
        ranges <- c(ranges, paste(start, prev, sep="-"))
      }
      start <- nums[i]
    }
    prev <- nums[i]
  }

  # Handle the last number or range
  if (start == prev) {
    ranges <- c(ranges, as.character(start))
  } else {
    ranges <- c(ranges, paste(start, prev, sep="-"))
  }

  # Join all ranges with commas
  paste(ranges, collapse=", ")
}

# Your sequence
nums <- c(1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20)

# Apply the function
result <- condense_sequence(nums)
print(result)
# Output: "1, 3-5, 7-8, 12-15, 20"

Which appears to work well, though you may have other thoughts in mind /
edge cases this code does not cover.

Best,
Steven

Cute exercise!

"Simple" is in the eyes of the beholder, of course. There is probably a
package out there that can do this in a trice .
But my first thought -- so caveat emptor!, as my thoughts, first or last,
are often not so, um... thoughtful -- is to diff() the sequence (as
numerics) -- so that differences of 1 appears as identical -- and then make
use of rle(). I think that one should be able to tweak this appropriately
to make it work, but I leave the details to you (and to me as something to
keep the little gray cells from atrophying). Note that somewhere along the
line, you'll have to convert numerics to character, as "-" is obviously not
going to cut it as a numeric. :-)

Cheers,
Bert

Dennis,

You are supposedly using a vector containing integers, in order, and want to
find sequences to rewrite compactly based on your example.

What result do you want. An integer vector cannot hold something like 3-5 so
do you want an integer of character stringls like this:

c("1", "3-5", "7-8", "12-15", "20")

Or do you want a single string like: "1, 3-5, 7-8, 12-15, 20"

Or do you want other more exotic things like slices that might not actually
be simpler or shorter.

There may well be such functionality available, perhaps in some package, but
you probably could easily roll your own for the first alternatives. Consider
a function, perhaps recursive, which checks the first item in a vector and
loops as long as it has not reached the end and checks if the next integer
is one more. As soon as it changes, or the end is reached, take the subset
of indices from first to last and bundle them to attach as one unit to what
you have so far. The can mean making a string like first-last to add as one
unit to a growing vector or at the end of a growing string.

If you are doing this recursively, call the function again on a truncated
version of the original input containg the so-far unused parts as something
to attach to what you already have.

This may not be the simple functionality you want so I looked for packages.
This one may be close:

install.packages("denstrip")
library(denstrip)
seqToIntervals(c(1:10, 15:18, 20))
  from to
1    1 10
2   15 18
3   20 20

It is a matrix of stop/start and can be converted to your format with a
little work or by using some parts of the source code for yourself and at a
point, substituting in your format. It may take work if you get something
like this:

> apply(ranges, 1, paste, sep="-")
          1           2           3 
 "c(1, 10)" "c(15, 18)" "c(20, 20)"

You might then use something like grep's substitute to replace "c(" and ")"
with nothing and a "," by a "-" and so on.

The package description is here, and there may well be other better ones:

Colleagues

I have a sequence like:
	1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20

I would like to display it as:
	1, 3-5, 7-8, 12-15, 20

Any simple ways to accomplish this?

Hello,

Here is a way with package R.utils, function seqToIntervals.


x <- scan(text = "1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20", sep = ",")

mat <- R.utils::seqToIntervals(x)
apply(mat, 1L, \(m) {
   ifelse(m[1L] == m[2L], m[1L], paste(m, collapse = "-"))
})
#> [1] "1"     "3-5"   "7-8"   "12-15" "20"


If you want to be fancy, define a special class that prints like that.



x <- scan(text = "1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20", sep = ",")

as_seqInterval <- function(x) {
   old_class <- class(x)
   class(x) <- c("seqInterval", old_class)
   x
}
print.seqInterval <- function(x, ...) {
   mat <- R.utils::seqToIntervals(x)
   out <- apply(mat, 1L, \(m) {
     ifelse(m[1L] == m[2L], m[1L], paste(m, collapse = "-"))
   })
   print(out)
}

y <- as_seqInterval(x)
class(y)
#> [1] "seqInterval" "numeric"

# autoprinting y
y
#> [1] "1"     "3-5"   "7-8"   "12-15" "20"

# explicit printing y
print(y)
#> [1] "1"     "3-5"   "7-8"   "12-15" "20"


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Well, as I predicted, my initial suggestions were, ... ummm, rather dumb.
Also, Rui's suggestions are probably preferable to the below. However, it
*is* a very simple, bare-boned approach to converting a sequence of
increasing integers to a character representation using interval notation.
The code is *very* simple-minded and needs no explanation, I think. You
should also be able to easily tweak it to change the output format from my
paste0(..., collapse) choice to something else.

compr <- function(x, sep ="-", collapse = ", ")
{
   left<- c(TRUE, diff(x) != 1)
   right <- c(rev(diff(rev(x)) != -1 ), TRUE)
   xleft <- x[left]
   xright <- x[right]
   ifelse(xleft == xright,
            xleft,
            paste(xleft, xright, sep = sep)) |>
       paste0(collapse = collapse)
}

which yields the following with your example

> compr(c( 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20))
[1] "1, 3-5, 7-8, 12-15, 20"   ##Note: A single character string

(Do let me know if this can fail)

Cheers,
Bert

Rui,

Your post (way at the bottom) expands beyond what was requested and that makes it more interesting. 

I like to look at what I consider reusable ideas and tools.

One was the reminder of using apply across rows of a matrix which would have applied to my earlier post of a package that also created a matrix of sequential followed by a count. 

Another was the idea of creating a changed object that now has an additional class that can determine which new print function to use automagically. I do wonder what happens if there are other classes that also have such a function. Does the first class in the listing dominate?

Finally, I have been considering the broader question of how to create a more abstract function along the lines being discussed. 

This request was about integers and the definition of being next but contiguous was to be one apart. Clearly, there can be cases where you want say just contiguous even (or odd) numbers so that c(2, 6,8,10) becomes "2, 6-10" as in street addresses for deliveries on one side of a street where all addresses on that side are even. That could be handled by not hard-coding in a difference of 1, but providing a successor() function that returns TRUE/FALSE when supplied with two arguments. One method is to allow such a function as an argument.

A related idea would be to allow other entries where a successor has meaning. Consider c("a", "c", "d", "e", "x", "y") which you can imagine collapsed as "a, c-e, x-y" as one example. But you can broaden it to work with something like Roman numerals in text form. Having a successor function, as above, could allow such additional functionality.

And, of course, other options could be allowed, perhaps to just pass through, so that you can specify the sep(arator) or col(lapse) strings such as instead of this:

"1, 3-6, 12-19"

You might see:

1
3:6
12:19

As in multiple lines and colon separated.

But one question I keep asking is about complexity. We have seen a number of solutions and some of them require many passes over what could be a long vector and other data structures like matrices with quite a few passes. It is nice to re-use bits and pieces but perhaps for longer examples, not in prototyping mode, writing a custom function that passes minimally over the data, may be a better choice.

Hello,

Here is a way with package R.utils, function seqToIntervals.


x <- scan(text = "1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20", sep = ",")

mat <- R.utils::seqToIntervals(x)
apply(mat, 1L, \(m) {
   ifelse(m[1L] == m[2L], m[1L], paste(m, collapse = "-"))
})
#> [1] "1"     "3-5"   "7-8"   "12-15" "20"


If you want to be fancy, define a special class that prints like that.



x <- scan(text = "1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20", sep = ",")

as_seqInterval <- function(x) {
   old_class <- class(x)
   class(x) <- c("seqInterval", old_class)
   x
}
print.seqInterval <- function(x, ...) {
   mat <- R.utils::seqToIntervals(x)
   out <- apply(mat, 1L, \(m) {
     ifelse(m[1L] == m[2L], m[1L], paste(m, collapse = "-"))
   })
   print(out)
}

y <- as_seqInterval(x)
class(y)
#> [1] "seqInterval" "numeric"

# autoprinting y
y
#> [1] "1"     "3-5"   "7-8"   "12-15" "20"

# explicit printing y
print(y)
#> [1] "1"     "3-5"   "7-8"   "12-15" "20"


Hope this helps,

Colleagues

I appreciate the many suggestions for my query about collapsing a sequence to a shortened string.  

I finally arrived at:

format_ranges <- function(x)
        {                       
	 x                  <- sort(unique(x))          
	breaks          <- which(diff(x) > 1)
        start_idx       <- c(1, breaks + 1)
        end_idx        <- c(breaks, length(x))
        ranges          <- mapply(function(s, e)
                {
                if (s == e)	return(as.character(x[s]))
                else        	return(paste(x[s], x[e], sep="-"))
                }, start_idx, end_idx)
        paste(ranges, collapse=", ")
        }

numbers <- c(1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20)
cat("original sequence is:\t\t", numbers, "\n")
cat("collapsed text string is:\t", format_ranges(numbers), "\n")

However, it *is* a very simple, bare-boned approach to converting a sequence of increasing integers to a character representation using interval notation. The code is *very* simple-minded and needs no explanation, I think. You should also be able to easily tweak it to change the output format from my paste0(..., collapse) choice to something else.

Yes, to call the 2nd, use NextMethod().

With the example from my first post, there is another advantage in using 
a new class. Since this new class sub-classes "numeric" "seqInterval" 
numbers can be added, subtracted, etc, they will keep the expected 
behaviour of numbers.



x2 <- c(1:3, 5, 6)
length(x)
#> [1] 11
length(x2)
#> [1] 5

y2 <- as_seqInterval(x2)
y2
#> [1] "1-3" "5-6"
x + x2
#> Warning in x + x2: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter 
object
#> length
#>  [1]  2  5  7 10 13  9 14 16 19 21 21

# make it more obvious that 9, 10 and 13, 14 should be compressed
sort(x + x2)
#> Warning in x + x2: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter 
object
#> length
#>  [1]  2  5  7  9 10 13 14 16 19 21 21

# to add two objects of class "seqInterval" keeps the compressing property
as_seqInterval(x + x2)
#> Warning in x + x2: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter 
object
#> length
#> [1] "2"     "5"     "7"     "9-10"  "13-14" "16"    "19"    "21"
y + y2
#> Warning in y + y2: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter

#> length
#> [1] "2"     "5"     "7"     "9-10"  "13-14" "16"    "19"    "21"

# now a division, the results are not integer
y/2
#> [1] "0-4" "6-7" "10"
unclass(y/2)
#> [1]  0.5  1.5  2.0  2.5  3.5  4.0  6.0  6.5  7.0  7.5 10.0

Hi Ben:

I realize that for the OP whether it takes 1/2 second or 1 microsecond to
do what he wants may be irrelevant, but just for fun I thought I'd time the
condense() function you found vs. the compr() function I worked out, which
are similar in their approach.

compr <- function(x, sep ="-")
{
   left<- c(TRUE, diff(x) != 1)
   right <- c(rev(diff(rev(x)) != -1 ), TRUE)
   xleft <- x[left]
   xright <- x[right]
   ifelse(xleft == xright,
            xleft,
            paste(xleft, xright, sep = sep))
}
Results were:

set.seed(4456)
x <- sort(sample(seq_len(1000), 800))
all(compr(x) == condense(x))  ##TRUE

library(microbenchmark)
> microbenchmark(compr(x), condense(x), times = 500)
Unit: microseconds
        expr      min       lq       mean    median        uq      max neval
    compr(x)   65.067   67.773   70.45071   69.0235   71.1145  113.857   500
 condense(x) 1022.089 1031.334 1116.02812 1036.2135 1049.8050 5249.271   500

As usual, ymmv, but the difference is due to vectorized and unvectorized
(tapply) computation, of course.

Cheers,
Bert
