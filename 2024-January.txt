If you do something like this

	for i in  $(pandoc --list-output-formats);
		do pandoc -f docx -t $i -o test.$i Now\ they\ want\ us\ to\ charge\
	our\ electric\ cars\ from\ litter\ bins.docx;
	done

you get approximately 65 formats, from which you can pick one which you can
write a little parser for. The dokuwiki one for example uses long lines
which
makes parsing easier.
