If you do something like this

	for i in  $(pandoc --list-output-formats);
		do pandoc -f docx -t $i -o test.$i Now\ they\ want\ us\ to\ charge\
	our\ electric\ cars\ from\ litter\ bins.docx;
	done

you get approximately 65 formats, from which you can pick one which you can
write a little parser for. The dokuwiki one for example uses long lines
which
makes parsing easier.

Subject: [R] Obtaining a value of pie in a zero inflated model (fm-zinb2)
Message-ID: <DM6PR03MB5049A6587CD8AB9A83A0FE02E2672@DM6PR03MB5049.namprd03.prod.outlook.com>

I am running a zero inflated regression using the zeroinfl function similar to the model below:
  
 fm_zinb2 <- zeroinfl(art ~ . | ., data = bioChemists, dist = "poisson")
summary(fm_zinb2)

I have three questions:

1) How can I obtain a value for the parameter pie, which is the fraction of the population that is in the zero inflated model vs the fraction in the count model? 

2) For any particular subject, how can I determine if the subject is in the portion of the population that contributes a zero count because the subject is in the group of subjects who have structural zero responses vs. the subject being in the portion of the population who can contribute a zero or a non-zero response?

3) zero inflated models can be solved using closed form solutions, or using iterative methods. Which method is used by fm_zinb2?

Thank you,
John

Hi folks

Thanks for your help and suggestions - very much appreciated.

I now have some working code, using this file I uploaded for public 
access: 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QwuaWZk6tYlWQXJ3WLczxC8Cda6zVERk/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103065135255080058813&rtpof=true&sd=true 


The small code segment that now works is as follows:

###########

# Load libraries
library(textreadr)
library(tcltk)
library(tidyverse)
#library(officer)
#library(stringr) #for splitting and trimming raw data
#library(tidyr) #for converting to wide format

# I'd like to keep this as it enables more control over the selected 
directories
filepath <- setwd(tk_choose.dir())

# The following correctly lists the names of all 9 files in my test 
directory
files <- list.files(filepath, ".docx")
files
length(files)

# Ideally, I'd like to skip this step by being able to automatically 
read in the name of each file, but one step at a time:
filename <- "Now they want us to charge our electric cars from litter 
bins.docx"

# This produces the file content as output when run, and identifies the 
fields that I want to extract.
read_docx(filename) %>%
 ? str_split(",") %>%
 ? unlist() %>%
 ? str_trim()

###########

What I'd like to try and accomplish next is to extract the data from 
selected fields and append to a spreadsheet (Calc or Excel) under 
specific columns, or if it is easier to write a CSV which I can then use 
later.

The fields I want to extract are illustrated with reference to the above 
file, viz.:

The title: "Now they want us to charge our electric cars from litter bins"
The name of the newspaper: "Mail on Sunday (London)"
The publication date: "September 24, 2023" (in date format, preferably 
separated into month and year (day is not important))
The section: "NEWS"
The page number(s): "16" (as numeric)
The length: "515" (as numeric)
The author: "Anna Mikhailova"
The subject: from the Subject section, but this is to match a value e.g. 
GREENWASHING >= 50% (here this value is 51% so would be included). A 
match moves onto select the highest value under the section "Industry" 
(here it is ELECTRIC MOBILITY (91%)) and appends this text and % value. 
If no match with 'Greenwashing', then appends 'Null' and moves onto the 
next file in the directory.

###########

The theory I am working with is if I can figure out how to extract these 
fields and append correctly, then the rest should just be wrapping this 
up in a for loop.

However, I am struggling to get my head around the extraction and append 
part. If I can get it to work for one of these fields, I suspect that I 
can repeat the basic syntax to extract and append the remaining fields.

Therefore, if someone can either suggest a syntax or point me to a 
useful tutorial, that would be splendid.

Thank you in anticipation.

Best wishes
Andy

Are you referring to the zeroinfl() function in the countreg package? If
so, I think

predict(fm_zinb2, type = "zero", newdata = some.new.data)

will give you pi for each combination of covariate values that you
provide in some.new.data

where pi is the probability to observe a zero from the point mass component.

As to your second question, I'm not sure that's possible, for any
*particular, individual* subject. Others will undoubtedly know better
than I.

Subject: [R] Amelia. Imputation of time-series data
Message-ID: <DM6PR03MB50495751D572168AACAECC72E2652@DM6PR03MB5049.namprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Colleagues,

I have started working with Amelia, with the aim of imputing missing data for time-series data. 

Although I have succeeded in getting Amelia to perform the imputation, I have not found any documentation describing how Amelia imputes time-series data. I have read the basic Amelia documentation, but it does not address how time-series data are imputed. The documentation describes general imputation where there is no serial auto correlation of repeated observations from the same subject. Does Amelia incorporate the serial autocorrelation in the imputation procedure? Can someone direct me to documentation that explains the imputation method? 

Thank you,
John

Hi Tim

This is brilliant - thank you!!

I've had to tweak the basePath line a bit (I am on a Linux machine), but 
having done that, the code works as intended. This is a truly helpful 
contribution that gives me ideas about how to work it through for the 
missing fields, which is one of the major sticking points I kept bumping 
up against.

Thank you so much for this.

All the best
Andy

 Obtaining a value of pie in a zero inflated model (fm-zinb2)

    A little more.

   As Christopher Ryan points out, as long as the zero-inflation model 
is non-trivial (i.e. more complex than a single intercept for the whole 
population), there's a pi(i) for every observation i (you could 
certainly average the pi(i) values if you wanted, or compute pi for an 
averaged set of covariates).

library(pscl)
fm_zinb2 <- zeroinfl(art ~ . | ., data = bioChemists, dist = "poisson")

pi_i <- predict(fm_zinb2, type = "zero")
head(pi_i)
##          1          2          3          4          5          6
## 0.13392803 0.21936320 0.21973454 0.24697313 0.01890023 0.34281196


To get the conditional probability that a zero observation is a 
structural or a sampling zero, compute the probability of a sampling 
zero (exp(-mu[i]) for a Poisson model) and use Bayes' rule, assuming 
equal prior probs

## probability of _sampling_ zero

psampz <- exp(-predict(fm_zinb2, type = "count"))
head(psampz)
##          1          2          3          4          5          6
## 0.09507376 0.18361241 0.18688646 0.14774602 0.08992667 0.27235498

pz <- 1 - (1-pi_i)*(1-psampz)  ## prob of zero of either type
##         1         2         3         4         5         6
## 0.2162687 0.3626978 0.3655556 0.3582299 0.1071273 0.5218004

psampz/pz
head(psampz)/head(pz)
##         1         2         3         4         5         6
## 0.4396093 0.5062408 0.5112395 0.4124336 0.8394378 0.5219524

    3. I'm not aware of a closed-form solution for zero-inflation models 
as long as the count and/or structural-zero components depend on 
covariates?  In any case, looking inside zeroinfl() you can see that it 
calls optim() [using BFGS by default, see ?pscl::zeroinfl.control]

   cheers

Subject: [R] how to specify uncorrelated random effects in nlme::lme()
Message-ID: <tencent_539E16DC4644F14A681BCCBC@qq.com>

Dear professor,


I'm using package nlme, but I can't find a way to specify two uncorrelated random effects. For example, a random intercept and a random slope. In package lme4, we can specify&nbsp;x + (x ll g) to realize, but how in nlme?


Thanks!

Dear Zhen,

You can use this with pdDiag(). An example:

library(nlme)
res <- lme(distance ~ age*Sex, random = list(Subject = pdDiag(~ age)), data=Orthodont)
summary(res)

Wolfgang

Hello As a postgrad I have been helping an undergraduate student with R
coding but she has a problem with R studio on her laptop which I can't fix
- basically when she runs a plot it appears without a y axis label with the
black line plot frame hard against the plot window and the bottom of the
plot, where you would expect to see the horizontal axis and the x axis
label etc is completely "chopped off" by the bottom edge of the R studio
interface window.  I can't find anything on the net detailing this problem
- can anyone help?  I have a screenshot which could email if anyone needs
to see what it looks like.

Does this happen only in RStudio?  She can run `pdf("somefile.pdf")` 
before plotting and `dev.off()` after to save the results to a PDF file 
instead.  If the problem only occurs in RStudio, then you should 
probably contact Posit or one of their community support groups about it.

If it happens in other devices too:  is she using base graphics, or 
ggplot2, or something else?  If she's using base graphics, take a look 
at `par("mar")`.  That gives the size of the margins measured in lines 
of text; they are in the order bottom, left, top, right, with default 
value `c(5.1, 4.1, 4.1, 2.1)`.  Perhaps she has set the 2nd entry to zero.

I'm sure there's something similar in ggplot2 and other graphics 
systems, but I don't know what it would be.

It would help to have reproducible code. Use dummy data for confidentiality (if you care about that).
My guess is that you set margins somewhere and never returned them to a default value. The first thing I would try is to open a new window in RStudio, copy the smallest piece of code that will give you the graph you want. Clear out the Environment using the broom icon, and then run your code. This makes sure that your results are only from your current code and not getting mixed up with stuff you ran last week/month. This might solve the problem, or it can be what you post as an example to get further help.

There is an RStudio help forum that might also help.

Does the problem happen with plain R, without Rstudio?

What's the student's sessionInfo()?

I think that PNG screenshots are allowed on the mailing list, so it
could be very helpful if you attached an appropriately cropped
screenshot.

If it looks to be a very specific RStudio/ggplot2 problem then
https://community.rstudio.com is probably the place to ask.

What happens if she does as Duncan suggests or if she exports the file?

Come to think of it, is she getting the same result if she clicks on Zoom
in the plot window? The standard plot window in RStudio can distort the
actual image due to size restrictions.

Nick, obviously figuring out the problem is best but you may want to deal
with the symptom.

RSTUDIO lets you adjust the sizes of the various windows and enlarging the
window (lower right normally) where the graph is shown may be a first
attempt if the problem is display space.

And note RSTUDIO in that window lets you zoom a pop-out window with the
graph. It also lets you save the graph into files with various formats.

And, as someone else pointed out, you can change the program to choose a
device to save the output in.

Of course, if the real problem is in some aspect of the setup that causes
the clipping, that has to be looked at.

If the problem is in RSTUDIO, not just R, this is not the right forum to
deal with it.

Message-ID: <CA+Rxh84ii9JGitkPEp+2=rr-WTiKpg7kq4YSM=LELRpq08Tg7w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am drawing contour lines for a function of 2 variables at one level of
the value of the function and want to include a small arrow in any
direction of increase of the function. Is there some way to do that?

Below is an example that creates the contour lines. How do I add one small
arrow on each line in the direction of increase of the function (at some
central point of the contour line)? Any direction will do, but perhaps the
direction of the gradient will be the best.

Thanks in advance.

My solution would be to use base graphics and avoid the obfuscation
induced by ggplot().  The graphics produced by ggplot() are devilish
pretty, but ggplot() is devilish difficult to work with.  IMHO you need
an IQ of at least 200 (which leaves me about 150 points short!) to be
able to cope with its intricate and unintuitive syntax.

I believe that what you want to do is triv in base graphics, but I must
confess that I have not gone through the details.

cheers,

Can you use the information about the function (i.e. the myg object),
or are you restricted to the d2 data.frame?

Both ggplot and the core graphics use the algorithm from the
contourLines() function in order to draw the contour lines. (Lattice
does the same, but ports the function from C to R.) This function
returns a list of levels combined with vectors of `x` and `y`
coordinates for drawing the contour.

If you can use the myg function, you can differentiate it numerically
or symbolically, process the contourLines() output, evaluate the
gradient at one point per contour and draw additional arrows there.

If you are limited to the tabulated function values from the d2
data.frame, you have a more complicated problem on your hands. You can
either locate grid points closest to the contour segments at both sides
of the segment, determine the direction of growth, and draw an arrow
perpendicular to the contour segment (not equal to the gradient), or
find a way to estimate the gradient at arbitrary points between the
grid (e.g. by using a Taylor series stencil) and then go to the
previous paragraph.

Hi,

If I understand your intentions correctly, the simplest way would be to 
manually insert arrows using `geom_segment()` with the `arrow` argument:

```

ggplot(data = d1, aes(x=X1,y=X2,z=Z))+
 ? stat_contour(breaks = c(2)) +
 ? stat_contour(data=d2, aes(x=X1,y=X2,z=Z), breaks=c(6)) +
 ? geom_segment(
 ??? aes(x = 1.25, y = 1.50, xend = 1.4, yend = 1.325),
 ??? arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, "cm"))
 ? ) +
 ? geom_segment(
 ??? aes(x = 1.6, y = 1.95, xend = 1.8, yend = 1.75),
 ??? arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, "cm"))
 ? )

```

If your actual data is organized differently, you may also be able to do 
this in a more elegant programmatic way. Here is a StackOverflow 
conversation about this exact topic, one Google search away: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38008863/how-to-draw-a-nice-arrow-in-ggplot2

Something like this shodld worx.  You will need to fiddle around with the
actual co-ordinates etc. I just stuck an arrow in what seemed like a handy
place

Your function ignores the data, because it passes data[idx,] to coef(), 
not to lm().  coef() ignores it.  So the function is using the global 
variables you created earlier, not the ones in e.

Wrong place for the data=... argument. You meant to give it to lm(...),
but in the end it went to coef(...). Without the data=... argument, the
formula passed to lm() picks up the global variables inherited by the
func() closure.

Unfortunately, S3 methods really do have to ignore extra arguments they
don't understand if the class is to be extended, so coef.lm isn't
allowed to complain to you about it.

Dear Duncan,
Dear Ivan,

I really thank you a lot for your response.
So, if I correctly understand your answers the problem is coming from this line:

coef(lm(Score~ Time + factor(Country)),data=data[idx,])

This line should be:
coef(lm(Score~ Time + factor(Country),data=data[idx,]))

If yes, now I get an error message (code here below)! So, it still does not work.

   It took me a little while to figure this out, but: the problem is 
that if your resampling leaves out any countries (which is very likely), 
your model applied to the bootstrapped data will have fewer coefficients 
than your original model.

I tried this:

cc <- unique(e$Country)
func <- function(data, idx) {
    coef(lm(Score~ Time + factor(Country, levels =cc),data=data[idx,]))
}

but lm() automatically drops coefficients for missing countries (I 
didn't think about it too hard, but I thought they might get returned as 
NA and that boot() might be able to handle that ...)

   If you want to do this I think you'll have to find a way to do a 
*stratified* bootstrap, restricting the bootstrap samples so that they 
always contain at least one sample from each country ... (I would have 
expected "strata = as.numeric(e$Country)" to do this, but it doesn't 
work the way I thought ... it tries to compute the statistics for *each* 
stratum ...)

You can debug things like this by setting options(error = recover). That 
will drop into the debugger when the error occurs.  Examine t.star, r, 
and res[[r]] and you will likely see what the problem was.

My guess is that one of the bootstrap samples had a different selection 
of countries, so factor(Country) had different levels, and that would 
really mess things up.

You'll need to decide how to handle that:  If you are trying to estimate 
the coefficient for Italy in a sample that contains no data from Italy, 
what should the coefficient be?  (This is easier for Bayesians to 
handle:  we don't need data!)

Well, this would seem to work:

e <- data.frame(Score = Score
             , Country = factor(Country)
             , Time = Time)

ncountry <- nlevels(e$Country)
func= function(dat,idx) {
   if(length(unique(dat[idx,'Country'])) < ncountry) NA
   else coef(lm(Score~ Time + Country,data = dat[idx,]))
}
B <-  boot(e, func, R=1000)

boot.ci(B, index=2, type="perc")

Caveats:
1) boot.ci handles the NA's by omitting them, which of course gives a
smaller resample and longer CI's than the value of R specified in the call
to boot().

2) I do not know if the *nice* statistical properties of the nonparametric
bootstrap, e.g. asymptotic correctness, hold when bootstrap samples are
produced in this way.  I leave that to wiser heads than me.

Cheers,
Bert

Perhaps NA?  Ben Bolker conjectured that boot() might be able to handle
this.  Getting the NAs into the coefficients is a bit of a fag, but.  I
tried:

func <- function(data, idx) {
clyde <- coef(lm(Score~ Time + factor(Country),data=data))
ccc <- coef(lm(Score~ Time + factor(Country),data=data[idx,]))
urk <- rep(NA,length(clyde))
names(urk) <-names(clyde)
urk[names(ccc)] <- ccc
urk
}

It produced a result:

However I have no idea if the result is correct, or even meaningful. I
have no idea what I'm doing.  Just hammering and hoping. ??
