Stefano,

I see you already have an answer that works for you.

Sometimes you want to step back and see if some modification makes a problem easier to solve.

I often simply switch to using tools in the tidyverse such as dplyr for parts of the job albeit much of the same can be done using functions built-in to R.

In your case, there are many possible solutions besides taking the max in some way as in a factor column.

You seem to expect exactly 48 measurements. Currently you encode them as one of two character strings but if this is really a binary choice, you could have used a 0/1 or TRUE/FALSE column instead, or make one. This lets you do things like take the sum and compare it to 48 to see if all are true, or to zero to check if all are false. You could take the product to check if at least one is false or use a negation for another perspective. If the number of rows may not be 48, you can compare to a calculation of the actual number of rows in that subset.

If your data was placed into wide format, say based on your hs field being unique for each test site, there are similar ideas by taking a subset of the columns and applying things  by using functions like rowSum.

Again, some things I commonly use in dplyr such as group_by() and how it impacts other operations including reports, makes this a little different but most things can be done with careful use of base R, except areas where dplyr supports more and more abstract ways to specify what you want and that your example does not need.

Just FYI, you did not share what your function my.mean() is. 

I won't share the code unless interested but it looks like part of what you are doing is to bundle by a truncated version of date/time to just a day.  I am not sure your method is optimal. You make a list of three different things containing parts of a date. That can work but as dates are already looking like 2024-01-02 which sorts and compares well alphabetically, I wonder if instead you group by that.

Subject: [R] aggregating data with quality control

Dear R-list users,

I deal with semi-hourly data from automatic meteorological stations.

They have to pass a manual validation; suppose that status = "C" stands for correct and status = "D" for discarded.

Here a simple example with "Snow height" (HS):


mydf <- data.frame(data_POSIX=seq(as.POSIXct("2024-01-01 00:00:00", format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", tz="Etc/GMT-1"), as.POSIXct("2024-01-02 23:30:00", format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", tz="Etc/GMT-1"), by="30 min"))

mydf$hs <- round(runif(96, 0, 100))

mydf$status <- c(rep("C", 50), "S", rep("C", 45))


Evaluating the daily mean indipendently from the status is very easy:

aggregate(mydf$hs, by=list(format(mydf$data_POSIX, "%Y"), format(mydf$data_POSIX, "%m"), format(mydf$data_POSIX, "%d")), my.mean)


Things become more complicated when I need to export also the status: this should be "C" when all 48 data have status equal to "C", and status "D" when at least one value has status ="D".


I have no clue on how to do that in an efficient way.

Could some of you give me some clues on how to do that?


Thank you for your usual support

Stefano Sofia

Subject: [R] Adding parameters for Benchmark normal distribution in
 shapiro.test
Message-ID: <CA+dpOJnCG=jhE=T4fdsq8F6X8JiLQmm81jX=kTGcMokywCC13w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In ?shapiro.test, there seems to be no option to pass mean and sd
information of the Normal distribution which I want to compare my
sample data to.

For example in the code below, I want to test my sample to N(0, 10).

shapiro.test(rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 3))

Is there any way to pass the information of the benchmark normal distribution?

Wouldn't that be because the sample is not being compared to a specific distribution but rather to many possible distributions by MC? [1]

If you think that need not be the case, perhaps you can write your own test... but then it will probably be answering a different question?

   From Shapiro and Wilk's paper:

 > The objective is to derive a test for the hypothesis that this is a 
sample from a normal distribution with unknown mean mu and unknown 
variance sigma^2

  That is, the estimates of the mean and SD are folded into the 
derivation of the test statistic.

   If you want to test against a specified alternative you could try 
e.g. a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test

set.seed(101)
x <- rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 3)

ks.test(x, "pnorm", 0, 10)

Dear R Users,

I am pleased to announce that Goodreader 0.1.1 is now available on CRAN.

Goodreader offers a toolkit for scraping and analyzing book data from
Goodreads. Users can search for books, scrape detailed information and
reviews, perform sentiment analysis on reviews, and conduct topic modeling.

Here?s a quick overview of how to use Goodreader:
# Search for books
AI_df <- search_goodreads(search_term = "artificial intelligence",
search_in = "title", num_books = 10, sort_by = "ratings")

# Retrieve Book IDs and save them to a text file
get_book_ids(input_data = AI_df, file_name = "AI_books.txt")

# Get book-related information
scrape_books(book_ids_path = "AI_books.txt")

# Scrape book reviews
scrape_reviews(book_ids_path = "AI_books.txt", num_reviews = 10)

Message-ID: <CA+dpOJ=Opxvsc+GM06ge=Rpqecr6KTMr7x-WytL3W3uzndkbeQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have below logistic regression

Dat =

head(Dat)
Model = glm(Purchased ~ Gender, data = Dat, family = binomial())

How I can get Standard deviation of forecasts as

head(predict(Model, type="response", se.fit = T)$se.fit)

My question: given that in Logistic regression, logit link is used,
how R calculate SE for the predicted probability from the VCV matrix
of estimated coefficients?

Does R uses some approximation like delta rule?

Hi all,

I build a dataset processing in the same way the same data in Windows than in Linux.

The output of Windows processing is: https://gitlab.com/iagogv/repdata/-/raw/main/exdata.csv?ref_type=heads
The output of Linux processing is: https://gitlab.com/iagogv/repdata/-/raw/main/exdata2.csv?ref_type=heads

exdata=as.matrix(read.csv("https://gitlab.com/iagogv/repdata/-/raw/main/exdata.csv?ref_type=heads", header=FALSE))
exdata2=as.matrix(read.csv("https://gitlab.com/iagogv/repdata/-/raw/main/exdata2.csv?ref_type=heads", header=FALSE))

They are not identical (`identical(exdata,exdata2)` is FALSE), but they are essentially equal (`all.equal(exdata,exdata2)` is TRUE). If I run

set.seed(20232260)
exkmns <- kmeans(exdata, centers = 7, iter.max = 2000, nstart = 750)

I get

exkmns$centers

both in Windows  (1) and in Linux (2, 3) up to rows order. If I run in Linux in my computer (2)

set.seed(20232260)
exkmns2 <- kmeans(exdata2, centers = 7, iter.max = 2000, nstart = 750)

then, I get

therefore, all rows essentially equal except for rows 5 and 7 of first dataset (5 and 4 of second dataset).  With a bit more detail:

  *

  *
Row -0.58527394 -0.1790337 -0.46778956  0.03573883  0.15473589 -0.07980379 belongs to the dataset and it is only center for exdata2 on Linux in my computer
  *
Row 0.03409765  0.3492520 -0.36910409 -0.40721418 -0.21482793  0.03073180 does not belong to the dataset and it is only center for exdata2 on Linux in my computer
  *
All other 4 rows (1,2,4 and 6 of first output) do not belong to the dataset and are common centers.

Even, further, if I run

set.seed(20232260)
exkmns <- kmeans(exdata, centers = 7, iter.max = 2000, nstart = 750)

in  posit.cloud (3), I get the same result than above. However, if I run (both in posit.cloud or in Windows)

set.seed(20232260)

So only its rows 4 and 5 are common centers to both of previous outputs and row 3 is common width exdata centers.

Does all this have any sense?

I have no clue, but I did note that you are using different versions of
BLAS/LAPACK on the different platforms. Could that be (part) of the issue?

Good catch!  My gut feeling would say "yes!" that is almost surely part of
the issue.

Additionally, careful reading of the help page (*before* any post ..)
would have shown

   Note:

	The clusters are numbered in the returned object, but they are a
	_set_ and no ordering is implied.  (Their apparent ordering may
	differ by platform.)

Thanks both Bert and Martin,

However  exkmns2$centers is common in posit.cloud  - LAPACK version 3.9.0- and in Windows -LAPACK 3.12.0-, while  distinct with my Linux settings -LAPACK version 3.11.0- (I don't know the BLAS version used by R in windows). It is a bit strange...

Good catch!  My gut feeling would say "yes!" that is almost surely part of
the issue.

Additionally, careful reading of the help page (*before* any post ..)
would have shown

   Note:

        The clusters are numbered in the returned object, but they are a
        _set_ and no ordering is implied.  (Their apparent ordering may
        differ by platform.)

Subject: [R] dotchart and dotplot(lattice) plot with two/three conditioning
 variables
Message-ID: <CAFL9eu=RLJ2-cdDSkjp_uokTnAahGxaX2YE6w51zE7kkm6YM_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, I am trying to make a Cleaveland Dotplot with two, if possible
three, variables on the vertical axis. I was able to do it in Stata
with two variables, Year and Population (see graph at the link:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SiIfmmqk6IFa_OI5i26Ux1ZxkN2oek-o/view?usp=sharing
). I hope the link to the graph works. I have never tried this before.

I want to make a similar (possibly better) graph in R. I tried several
ways to make it in R with dotchart() and dotplot(lattice). I have been
only partially successful thus far. I would like Year, Population and
popGroup on the vertical axis. If popGroup occupies too much space,
then I would like a gap between the groups of Cities and Villages, so
they can be seen as distinct "Populations". My code and a made-up data
are below (in actual data I have 18 categories in "Population",
instead of only six in the made-up data). How can I make this type of
graph?

# Only for 2004-05. How to plot 2011-12 on the same plot?
dotchart(test$"X0_50"[test$"Year"=="2004-05"], labels=test$Population,
xlab = "Income Share ",
         main = "Income shares of percentiles of population", xlim = c(12, 50))
points(test$"X50_90"[test$"Year"=="2004-05"], 1:6, pch = 2)
points(test$"X90_100"[test$"Year"=="2004-05"], 1:6, pch = 16)
legend(x = "topleft",
       legend = c("0-50%", "50-90%", "90-100%"),
       pch = c(1,2, 16)
)

# reorder so Year 2004-05 is plotted before Year 2011-12. This is not
plotting correctly for
# second and third variables. Gap between different Cities and
Villages is quite a bit.
test2 <- test[order(test$seqCode, test$Year, decreasing = T),]

dotchart(test2$"X0_50", labels=test2$Year, xlab = "Income Share ",
         main = "Income shares of percentiles of population", groups =
as.factor(test2$Population), xlim = c(12, 50))
points(test2$"X50_90", 1:12, pch = 2)
points(test2$"X90_100", 1: 12, pch = 16)


# use lattice library
library(lattice)
dotplot(reorder(Population, -seqCode) ~ test$"X0_50" + test$"X50_90" +
test$"X90_100", data = test, auto.key = TRUE)

testLong <- reshape(test, idvar = c("Population", "Year"), varying = list(5:7),
                           v.names = "ptile", direction = "long")

dotplot(reorder(Population, -seqCode) ~ ptile | Year, data = testLong,
groups = time, auto.key = T)

Dataframe is below using dput(). Dataframe is named "test" in my code.

structure(list(seqCode = c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 5L, 6L, 1L, 2L, 3L,
4L, 5L, 6L), popGroup = c("City", "City", "City", "Village",
"Village", "Village", "City", "City", "City", "Village", "Village",
"Village"), Population = c("Dallas", "Boston", "Chicago", "Kip",
"Von", "Dan", "Dallas", "Boston", "Chicago", "Kip", "Von", "Dan"
), Year = c("2004-05", "2004-05", "2004-05", "2004-05", "2004-05",
"2004-05", "2011-12", "2011-12", "2011-12", "2011-12", "2011-12",
"2011-12"), X0_50 = c(15.47, 21.29, 18.04, 15.62, 18.89, 24.37,
17.43, 17.99, 18.04, 14.95, 16.33, 28.98), X50_90 = c(44.12,
43.25, 45.72, 46.15, 43.84, 46.24, 44.39, 44.08, 43.62, 42.89,
44.57, 47.14), X90_100 = c(40.42, 35.47, 36.24, 38.24, 37.27,
29.39, 38.18, 37.93, 38.34, 42.16, 39.11, 23.88)), class =

For lattice::dotplot(), you are close; this is more like the layout you
want:

dotplot(Year ~ ptile | reorder(Population, ptile, mean), testLong,
        groups = c("0-50", "50-90", "90-100")[time],
        layout = c(1, NA),
        par.settings = simpleTheme(pch = 16), auto.key = TRUE)

dotchart() works better with tables, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to
handle more than two dimensions, so you can only get one group at a time:

xtabs(ptile ~ Year + Population, testLong, subset = time == 1) |>
dotchart(pch = 16)

This seems like something that should not be too difficult to improve.

Best,

Hi,

I am trying to replicate the R's result for VCV matrix of estimated
coefficients from linear model as below

data(mtcars)
model <- lm(mpg~disp+hp, data=mtcars)
model_summ <-summary(model)
MSE = mean(model_summ$residuals^2)
vcov(model)

Now I want to calculate the same thing manually,

library(dplyr)
X = as.matrix(mtcars[, c('disp', 'hp')] %>% mutate(Intercept = 1));
solve(t(X) %*% X) * MSE

Unfortunately they do not match.

Could you please help where I made mistake, if any.

Thanks

The number you need for MSE is

sum(residuals(model)^2)/df.residual(model)

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] Goodreader: Scrape and Analyze 'Goodreads' Book Data
Message-ID: <CACCU-vM3B95EnoYz=-wKf5r+iWm-O8iCW6h-cBo-q+kjvuRk1Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R Users,

I am pleased to announce that Goodreader 0.1.1 is now available on CRAN.

Goodreader offers a toolkit for scraping and analyzing book data from
Goodreads. Users can search for books, scrape detailed information and
reviews, perform sentiment analysis on reviews, and conduct topic modeling.

Here?s a quick overview of how to use Goodreader:
# Search for books
AI_df <- search_goodreads(search_term = "artificial intelligence",
search_in = "title", num_books = 10, sort_by = "ratings")

# Retrieve Book IDs and save them to a text file
get_book_ids(input_data = AI_df, file_name = "AI_books.txt")

# Get book-related information
scrape_books(book_ids_path = "AI_books.txt")

# Scrape book reviews
scrape_reviews(book_ids_path = "AI_books.txt", num_reviews = 10)

For more details, please visit: https://liu-chao.site/Goodreader/

Best regards,

Chao Liu

Subject: [R] lattice log scale labels.
Message-ID: <b01b6e2d-9c73-420f-8170-0cb4c900f312@xs4all.nl>

Dear R-helpers,

In the plot below I would like to have labels at positions 2^(3*(0:10)),
and keep the labels in the exponential format.
I tried using yscale.components.default.

*This* gives the right format of the labels:
--------
 > yscale.components.default(lim= c(0,30),log=2)
....
$num.limit
[1]  0 30
...
[1]  0  5 10 15 20 25 30
...
$left$labels$labels
[1] "2^0"  "2^5"  "2^10" "2^15" "2^20" "2^25" "2^30"
--------

and *this* gives the right locations
--------
 > yscale.components.default(lim= c(0,30),log=2,at=2^(3*(0:10)))
$num.limit
[1]  0 30
...
  [1]  0  3  6  9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30
...
$left$labels$labels
  [1] "1"          "8"          "64"         "512"        "4096"
  [6] "32768"      "262144"     "2097152"    "16777216"   "134217728"
[11] "1073741824"
--------

How can I get the format in the first example at the locations of the 
second?

Thanks,
Gerrit

sigma(model)^2 will give the correct MSE.  Also note that your model
matrix has intercept at
the end whereas vcov will have it at the beginning so you will need to
permute the rows
and columns to get them to be the same/

Do the "at" and "labels" components of the "scales" list argument to xyplot
not do what you want?

Cheers,
Bert

Thanks Greg and Bert for solving my problem.
This gives what I want:
----------------

myticks <- 2^(3*(0:11))
mylabels <- parse(text=paste0("2^",log2(myticks)))

xyplot(c+t+u~n,data=x,type="b", xlab="Size", ylab="Number of tangles",
   scales=list(x=list(at=4*(1:9)),y=list(log=2,at=myticks,labels=mylabels),
    auto.key=list(columns=3,text=c("(choose m n)","tangles","unique
       tangles"), points=FALSE,lines=TRUE)))
----------------
Solved!
Gerrit

Dear R Users,

Is this desired behaviour?
I presume it's a bug.

atan(1i)
# 0+Infi

tan(atan(1i))
# 0+1i

atan(1i) / 5
# NaN+Infi

There were some changes in handling of complex numbers. But it looks like a bug.

Sincerely,

There's no need to involve atan() and tan() in this:

[1] NaN+Infi

Why do you think this is a bug?

Dear Bert,

These behave like real divisions/multiplications:
complex(re=Inf, im = Inf) * 5
# Inf+Infi
complex(re=-Inf, im = Inf) * 5
# -Inf+Infi

The real division / multiplication should be faster and also is well behaved. I was expecting R to do the real division/multiplication on a complex number. Which R actually does for these very particular cases; but not when only Im(x) is Inf.

Sincerely,

Leonard

See the Note in ?complex for the explanation, I think.  Duncan can correct
if I'm wrong.

atan(1i) -> 0 + Inf i
complex(1/5) -> 0.2 + 0i
atan(1i) -> (0 + Inf i) * (0.2 + 0i)
-> 0*0.2 + 0*0i + Inf i * 0.2 + Inf i * 0i
infinity times zero is undefined
-> 0 + 0i + Inf i + NaN * i^2
-> 0 + 0i + Inf i - NaN
-> NaN + Inf i

I am not sure how complex arithmetic could arrive at another answer.

I advise against messing with infinities... use atan2() if you don't actually need complex arithmetic.

I imagine that what happens is that when one operand is complex, both 
are coerced to complex and the operation is carried out.  I had assumed 
this was documented in ?complex, but I don't see it there.  Maybe it 
should be.

If you want z/5 to be carried out using the correct mathematical 
approach, you'll probably have to define it yourself.  For example,

   CxByReal <- function(num, denom) {
     if (is.complex(denom)) stop("this is for a real denominator!")
     complex(real = Re(num)/denom, imaginary = Im(num)/denom)
   }

   CxByReal(complex(real=0, imaginary=Inf), 5)
   # [1] 0+Infi

R does the addition and subtraction "coordinatewise"; the C library handles
everything else. This results in 2 different ways the point at infinity is
printed.

(Correction requested if this is wrong)

Subject: [R] effects() extractor for a quantile reqression object: error
 message
Message-ID: <ff1b1a84-d571-7e4c-d7d6-195cd240442e@binghamton.edu>

I'm using quantreg package version 5.98 of 24 May 2024, in R 4.4.1 on
Linux Mint.

The online documentation for quantreg says, in part, under the
description of the rq.object, "The coefficients, residuals, and effects
may be extracted by the generic functions of the same name, rather than
by the $ operator."

I create an rq object for the 0.9 quantile, called qm.9

effects(qm.9)

yields, the error message, " effects(qm.9)
Error in UseMethod("effects") :
  no applicable method for 'effects' applied to an object of class "rq"

I'm confused. Appreciate any suggestions. Thanks.

I expect that atan(1i) = (0 + infinity i) and that atan(1i)/5 = (0 +
infinity i)/5 = (0 + infinity i).
Here's what I get in C:
(0,1) = (0, 1)
atan((0,1)) = (0, inf)
atan((0,1))/5 = (0, inf)

Note the difference between I*infinity = (0,1)*infinity =
(0*infinity,1*infinity) = (NaN,infinity)
and (0,infinity)/5 = (0/5,infinity/5) = (0,infinity).
The former involves multiplying 0 by infinity, which yields NaN.
The latter does not.

> complex(1,0,Inf)*2
[1] NaN+Infi
There is no good reason for this. 0*2 is 0, not NaN.

In IEEE arithmetic, multiplying or dividing a complex number by a real number is
NOT the same as multiplying or dividing by the complex version of that
real number.
(0,Inf) * 2 = (0*2, Inf*2) = (0, Inf).
(0,Inf) * (2,0) = (0*2 - Inf*0, 0*0 + Inf*2) = (NaN, Inf).

There really truly is a bug here, and it is treating R*Z, Z*R, and Z/R
as if they were
the same as W*Z, Z*W, and Z/W where W = complex(1,R,0).

The thing is that real*complex, complex*real, and complex/real are not
"complex arithmetic"
in the requisite sense.  The complex numbers are a vector space over
the reals, and
complex*real and real*complex are vector*scalar and scalar*vector.
For example, in the Ada programming language, we have
function "*" (Left, Right : Complex) return Complex;
function "*" (Left : Complex;   Right : Real'Base) return Complex;
function "*" (Left : Real'Base; Right : Complex)   return Complex;
showing that Z*R and Z*W involve *different* functions.

It's worth noting that complex*real and real*complex just require two
real multiplications,
no other arithmetic operations, while complex*complex requires four
real multiplications,
an addition, and a subtraction.  So implementing complex*real by
conventing the real
to complex is inefficient (as well as getting the finer points of IEEE
arithmetic wrong).
As for comple division, getting that *right* in floating-point is
fiendishly difficult (there are
lots of algorithms out there and the majority of them have serious
flaws) and woefully costly.
It's not unfair to characterise implementing complex/real by
conversion to complex and
doing complex/complex as a beginner's bungle.

There are good reasons why "double", "_Imaginary double", and "_Complex double"
are distinct types in standard C (as they are in Ada), and the
definition of multiplication
in G.5.1 para 2 is *direct* (not via complex*complex).

Now R has its own way of doing things, and if the judgement of the R
maintainers is
that keeping the "convert to a common type and then operate" model is
more important
than getting good answers, well, it's THEIR language, not mine.  But
let's not pretend
that the answers are *right* in any other sense.

Dear Duncan,

Here is also the missing information:
R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14 ucrt)
Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64
Running under: Windows 10 x64 (build 19045)

Regarding the results:
atan(1i)
# 0+Infi
Re(atan(1i))
# 0
Im(atan(1i))
#  Inf

0 + Inf i is a valid complex number:
tan(atan(1i))
# 0+1i

Inf / 5
# Inf

Note: atan(1i) / 5 should have generated 0 + Inf * 1i; even the explicit complex number fails:
complex(re=0, im = Inf) / 5
# NaN+Infi
complex(re=Inf, im = Inf) / 5
# Inf+Infi

I presume that R tries to do the complex division, although the real division is well defined.

Sincerely,

Leonard

There's no need to involve atan() and tan() in this:

[1] NaN+Infi

Why do you think this is a bug?

Unfortunately, the documentation is wrong, here.

You can always use

     methods(class = class(qm.9))

to get list of generic function names for there is a method for
your object (of class "rq") in this case...
and indeed, "effects" is not among them.

Possibly this was a thinko (on the 'rq.object' help page) and
it was "predict" that was meant there,
as indeed there is a predict method (actually there are even 3
different predict() methods in package 'quantreg', and they are
well documented on the  ?predict.qr  help page.

{OTOH my guess is that there originally *was* an effects method
 and it has been dropped in the mean time}

Yes, but they _also_ are field (and as others have argued mathematically only
have one infinity point),
and I think here we are fighting with which definition should
take precedence here.
The English Wikipedia page is even more extensive and precise,
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number   (line breaking by me):

 " The complex numbers form a rich structure that is simultaneously
  - an algebraically closed field, 
  - a commutative algebra over the reals,   and 
  - a Euclidean vector space of dimension two."

our problem "of course" is that we additionally add  +/- Inf for
the reals and for storage etc treating them as a 2D vector space
over the reals is "obvious".

ouch!  ... but still I tend to acknowledge your point, incl the "not unfair" ..

interesting.  OTOH, I think standard C did not have strict
standards about complex number storage etc in the mid 1990s
when R was created.

    > and the definition of multiplication

I see (did not know about) -- where can we find  'G.5.1 para 2'

Well, it should also be the R community's language,
where we, the R core team, do most of the "base" work and also
emphasize guaranteeing long term stability.

Personally, I think that
   "convert to a common type and then operate"
is a good rule and principle in many, even most places and cases,
but I hate it if humans should not be allowed to break good
rules for even better reasons  (but should rather behave like algorithms  ..).

This may well be a very good example of re-considering.
As mentioned above, e.g., I was not aware of the C language standard
being so specific here and different than what we've been doing
in R.


    > But let's not pretend
    > that the answers are *right* in any other sense.

I think that's too strong -- Jeff's computation (just here below)
is showing one well defined sense of "right" I'd say.
(Still I know and agree the    Inf * 0 |--> NaN
 rule *is* sometimes undesirable)

Chris,

This was intended to emulate the effects component of lm() fitting, but was never implemented.  Frankly, I don?t quite see on first glance how this works for lm() ? it seems to be (mostly) about situations where X is not full rank (see lm.fit) and I also never bothered to implement rq for X that were not full rank.

Also,

or even

I would only disagree with the statement above by distinguishing between 
a "bug" (where R is not behaving as documented) and a "design flaw" 
(where it is behaving as documented, but the behaviour is undesirable).

I think this is a design flaw rather than a bug.

The distinction is important:  if it is a design flaw, then a change is 
harder, because users who rely on the behaviour deserve more help in 
adapting than those who rely on a bug.  Bugs should be fixed.  Design 
flaws need thinking about, and sometimes shouldn't be fixed.

On the other hand, I was unable to find documentation saying that the 
current behaviour is intended, so I could be wrong.

I agree 100% (with Duncan).

I've now also carefully read  ?Arithmetic  and  ?complex
and could not find docu explicitly documenting the current
behavior, in the context of complex arithmetic not even
mentioning the "overall principle" used very often in R to

	1. coerce to common type
	2. then compute with that "pure type"

In ?complex, we have the (last sentence of the first) 'Note:'

 --->  For ?+? and ?-?, R's own handling works strictly ?coordinate wise?.

now, implicitly that implies that {+, -} are the only
ops/functions where coordinate-wise arithmetic is used/applied
and hence could it be _stretched_ to say that for
 * and /  coordinate wise does not always apply,
in our case not even when it would make sense, i.e., when one of
the two operands is real (in the '/' case, it must be the 2nd operand)
and hence 2d-vector space arithmetic  <scalar  *  vector>
should be applied naturally.

It is still true that this must be considered a design flaw
rather than a bug, even if only because the above  "overall
principle"  is predominant and tought very often when teaching R.

In this case, I do think we should look into the consequences of
indeed distinguishing
  <double> * <complex> 
  <complex> * <double>  and
  <complex> / <double>
from their respective current {1. coerce to complex, 2. use complex arith}
arithmetic.

Hence, thanks a lot for bringing this up, to Leo Mada and
notably to Richard O'Keefe  for providing context, notably wrt
to C standards  {which I'd want to follow mostly, but not
always ... but I'm not opening that now}...

Need to kill some time, so thought I'd Opine.

Given the intent, as I understood it... to extract components from a quantile regression (rq) object similar to how one might extract effects from an lm object.
 
Since it seems effects() is not implemented for rq, here are some alternative approaches to achieve similar functionality or extract useful information from the quantile regression model:

1. Extracting Coefficients. Use the coef() function to extract the coefficients of the quantile regression model. This is similar to extracting the effects in a linear model.

> coef(qm.9)

This will return the estimated coefficients for the 0.9 quantile.

2. Extracting Fitted Values. To get the fitted values from the quantile regression model, use: 

> fitted(qm.9)

This gives the fitted values for the quantile regression model, similar to what you'd see in an lm() model.

3. Extracting ResidualsResiduals from the quantile regression can be extracted using the resid() function: 

> resid(qm.9)

This gives the residuals for the 0.9 quantile regression model, which can be a useful diagnostic for checking model fit.

4. Manually Calculating "Effects".    While effects() is not available, you can manually calculate effects by examining the design matrix and the coefficients. If the term "effects" refers to the influence of different covariates in the model, these can be assessed by looking at the coefficients themselves and their impact on the fitted values.

5. Using the summary() Function.        The summary() function for rq objects provides detailed information about the quantile regression fit, including coefficient estimates, standard errors, and statistical significance:

> summary(qm.9)

This can give a more comprehensive understanding of how covariates are contributing to the model. 

6. Working with Design Matrices.            If you need the design matrix for further custom calculations, you can extract it using: 

> model.matrix(qm.9)                 

 This returns the matrix of predictor variables, which you can then use to manually compute the "effects" of changes in the predictors.

7. Explore Partial Effects with predict(). The predict() function can help you assess how changes in predictor values affect the outcome. For instance, to predict values at specific points in the design space, you can use: 

> predict(qm.9, newdata = data.frame(your_new_data))

8. Bootstrapping to Examine Variability. If you want to assess variability in the effects of predictors, you could use bootstrapping. The boot.rq() function in the quantreg package allows you to bootstrap the quantile regression coefficients, giving insight into the variability of the estimated "effects."

Example:

> boot_results <- boot.rq(y ~ X, tau = 0.9, data = your_data, R = 1000)

> summary(boot_results)

9.Interaction or Additive Effects (If Applicable). If you're trying to capture interaction or additive effects, you might need to specify interaction terms directly in your formula and then inspect the coefficients for these terms. Quantile regression will estimate these coefficients in the same manner as linear regression but specific to the quantile of interest.

In conclusion, while effects() is not available for quantile regression, the combination of coef(), fitted(), resid(), model.matrix(), and summary() provides the main components of a quantile regression model that should provide similar insights to what effects() provides for linear models.

Forgive any typos please... I'm on a mobile device.

Kind regards,
Gregg Powell

G.5.1 para 2 can be found in the C17 standard -- I actually have the
final draft not the published standard.  It's in earlier standards, I
just didn't check earlier standards.  Complex arithmetic was not in
the first C standard (C89) but was in C99.

The complex numbers do indeed form a field, and Z*W invokes an
operation in that field when Z and W are both complex numbers.  Z*R
and R*Z, where R is real-but-not-complex, is not that field operation;
it's the scalar multiplication from the vector spec view.

One way to characterise the C and Ada view is that real numbers x can
be viewed as (x,ZERO!!!) and imaginary numbers y*i can be viewed as
(ZERO!!!, y) where ZERO!!! is a real serious HARD zero, not an IEEE
+epsilon or -epsilon,  In fact this is important for getting "sign of
zero" right.
x + (u,v) = (x+u, v) *NOT* (x+u, v+0) and this does matter in IEEE arithmetic.

R is of course based on S, and S was not only designed before C got
complex numbers, but before there was an IEEE standard with things
like NaN, Inf, and signed zeros  But there *is* an IEEE standard now,
and even IBM mainframes offer IEEE-compliant arithmetic, so worrying
about the sign of zero etc is not something we can really overlook
these days.

You are of course correct that the one-point compactification of the
complex numbers involves adjoining just one infinity and that whacking
IEEE infinities into complex numbers does not give you anything
mathematically interesting (unless you count grief and vexation as
"interesting" (:-)).  Since R distinguishes between 0+Infi and
NaN+Infi, it's not clear that the one-point compactification has any
relevance to what R does.  And it's not just an unexpected NaN; with
all numbers finite you can get zeros with the wrong sign.  (S having
been designed before the sign of zero was something you needed to be
aware of.)

For what it's worth, the ISO "Language Independent Arithmetic"
standard, part 3, defines separate real, imaginary, and complex types,
and defines x*(z,w) to be (x*z, x*w) directly, just like C and Ada.
So it is quite clear that R does not currently conform to LIA-3.
LIA-3 (ISO/IEC 10967-3:2006) is the nearest we have to a definition of
what "right" answers are for floating-point complex arithmetic, and
what R does cannot be called "right" by that definition.  But of
course R doesn't claim conformance to any part of the LIA standard.

Whether the R community *want* R and C to give the same answers is not
for me to say.  I can only say that *I* found it reassuring that C
gave the expected answers when R did not, or, to put it another way,
disconcerting that R did not agree with C (or LIA-3).


What really annoys me is that I wrote an entire technical report on
(some of the) problems with complex arithmetic, and this whole "just
treat x as (x, +0.0)" thing completely failed to occur to me as
something anyone might do.

Subject: [R] BUG: atan(1i) / 5 = NaN+Infi ?

It seems to me that the documentation of R's complex class & R's atan function do not tell us what to expect, so (as others have suggested), some additional notes are needed. I think that mathematically atan(1i) should be NA_complex_, but R seems not to use any mathematically standard compactification of the complex plane (and I'm not sure that IEEE does either).

Incidentally, the signature of the complex constructor is confusing. complex(1L) returns zero, but complex(1L, argument=theta) is an element of the unit circle. The defaults suggest ambiguous results in case only length.out is specified, and you have to read a parenthesis in the details to figure out what will happen. Even then, the behaviour in my example is not spelled out (although it is suggested by negative inference). Moreover, the real & imaginary parts are ignored if either modulus or argument is provided, and I don't see that this is explained at all.

R's numeric (& IEEE's floating-point types) seem to approximate a multi-point compactification of the real line. +Inf & -Inf fill out the approximation to the extended real line, and NaN, NA_real_ & maybe some others handle some cases in which the answer does not live in the extended real line. (I'm not digging into bit patterns here. I suspect that there are several versions of NaN, but I hope that they all behave the same way.) The documentation suggests that a complex scalar in R is just a pair of numeric scalars, so we are not dealing with the Riemann sphere or any other usually-studied extension of the complex plane. Since R distinguishes various complex infinities (and seems to allow any combination of numeric values in real & imaginary parts), the usual mathematical answer for atan(1i) may no longer be relevant.

The tangent function has an essential singularity at complex infinity (the compactification point in the Riemann sphere, which I consider the natural extension for the study of meromorphic functions, for example making the tangent function well defined on the whole plane), so the usual extension of the plane does not give us an answer for atan(1i). However, another possible extension is the Cartesian square of the extended real line, and in that extension continuity suggests that tan(x + Inf*1i) = 1i and tan(x - Inf*1i) = -1i (for x real & finite). That is the result from R's tan function, and it explains why atan(1i) in R is not NA or NaN. The specific choice of pi/4 + Inf*1i puzzled me at first, but I think it's related to the branch-cut rules given in the documentation. The real part of atan((1+.Machine$double.eps)*1i) is pi/2, and the real part of atan((1-.Machine$double.eps)*1i) is zero, and someone apparently decided to average those for atan(1i).

TL;DR: The documentation needs more details, and I don't really like the extended complex plane that R implemented, but within that framework the answers for atan(1i) & atan(-1i) make sense.

Jorgen Harmse.

Ok.  Thank you.

A direct hopefully stable link to that final draft's  Appendix G
seems to be    
  https://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n2310.pdf#chapter.14

which is good to have available.

indeed, currently we only require C11 for R.

A longer term solution that we (the R core team) will probably
look into is to start making use of current C standards for
complex arithmetic.

As mentioned, all this was not yet available when R started and
already came with complex numbers as base type  ....
It may (or may not, I'm not the expert) be a bit challenging
trying to remain back compatible (e.g. with save complex number
R objects)  and still use C standard complex headers ...

But mid to long term I guess that would be the way to go.

Thank you.
Indeed, I'd  like the idea to consider  LIA  standards as much
as (sensibly) possible.

Message-ID: <CA+dpOJmXu6=+Ho9dosHyJW4fDhEE91S2c9_q59K66D74FhVFMw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to the data from
https://online.stat.psu.edu/onlinecourses/sites/stat501/files/ch15/employee.txt
without any success. Below is the error I am getting:

> read.delim('https://online.stat.psu.edu/onlinecourses/sites/stat501/files/ch15/employee.txt')

Error in make.names(col.names, unique = TRUE) :

  invalid multibyte string at '<ff><fe>t'

In addition: Warning messages:

1: In read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote = quote,  :

  line 1 appears to contain embedded nulls

2: In read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote = quote,  :

  line 2 appears to contain embedded nulls

3: In read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote = quote,  :

  line 3 appears to contain embedded nulls

4: In read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote = quote,  :

  line 4 appears to contain embedded nulls

5: In read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote = quote,  :

  line 5 appears to contain embedded nulls

Is there any way to read this data directly onto R?

Thanks for your time

Well, this is frankly an unsatisfactory answer, as it does not try to deal
properly with the issues that you experienced, which I also did. However,
it's simple and works. As this is a small text file,
simply copy it in your browser to the clipboard, and then use:
thefile <- read.table(text =
"<paste text here>", header = TRUE)
either in an editor or directly at the prompt in the console.

In fact here's the whole thing that you can just copy and paste from this
email:

thefile <-read.table(text =
"time vendor metal

That looks like a UTF-16LE byte order mark. Simply open the connection
with the proper encoding:

read.delim(
    'https://online.stat.psu.edu/onlinecourses/sites/stat501/files/ch15/employee.txt',
    fileEncoding = "UTF-16LE"
)

The <ff><fe> looks like a byte-order mark
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark).
Try this:

    fn <- file('https://online.stat.psu.edu/onlinecourses/sites/stat501/files/ch15/employee.txt',
               encoding = "UTF-16LE")
    read.delim(fn)

Add the

   fileEncoding = "UTF-16"

argument to the read call.

For a human explanation of why this is going on I recommend [1]. For a more R-related take, try [2].

For reference, I downloaded your file and used the "file" command line program typically available on Linux (and possibly MacOSX) which will tell you about what encoding is used in a particular file.

Ha, the proper answer!
Thanks for this, Iris. I followed up by consulting the Wikipedia "byte
order mark" entry and learned something I knew nothing about.

FWIW, if I had simply searched on <ff><fe>t it would have immediately led
me to BOMs.

Best,
Bert

When you specify LE in the encoding type, you are logically telling the decoder that you know the two-byte pairs are in little-endian order... which could override whatever the byte-order-mark was indicating. If the BOM indicated big-endian then the file decoding would break. If there is a BOM, don't override it unless you have to (e.g. for a wrong BOM)... leave off the LE unless you really need it.

That sounds like good advice, but it doesn't work:

I tried it on R 4.4.1 on Linux Mint 21.3 just before I posted it, and I just tried it on R 3.4.2 on Ubuntu 16.04 and R 4.3.2 on Windows 11 just now and it works on all of them.

I don't have a big-endian machine to test on, but the Unicode spec says to honor the BOM and if there isn't one to assume that it is big-endian data. But in this case there is a BOM so your machine has a buggy decoder?

Say that you have several files from different places or times and you wanted to run your program on all of them without reprogramming. You could start with the readr package and use guess_encoding.
j <- 1
for (i in file_paths){
  file_encoding[j] <- as.character(readr::guess_encoding(i)$encoding)
  j=j+1
}

With the encoding of each file, you can combine file_paths and file_encoding and then break this into multiple data frames based on encoding. Read all the data, reformat for consistency, and then combine them.

More simply, you could just guess_encoding() on one file just to see what it might be like. It gives you a name like UTF-16LE that you can then use in the encoding statement as others have already shown.

Message-ID: <CADKEMqiO42e5tfy6qC3VzUzabX31u5duS86Er0F5kXsJOrgoBQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All:

Background/setup:
Editor Emacs using "isend" to send code to shell in another window. This is
on Linux. I can share more of the setup if others would find it useful, but
I suspect this is an option I am unaware of.

Problem:
I am having a problem with accidentally typing an object name at the
console that is a very large list and then having to wait for it to be
printed until I can resume my work.

Is there a way that I have missed to stem this default behavior?
Kindest regards,

Stephen Sefick

Does it help to interrupt the process?

https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#index-C_002dc-C_002dc-_0028Shell-mode_0029
https://ess.r-project.org/Manual/ess.html#index-interrupting-R-commands

I'm afraid that the behaviour of the print() method is very
class-dependent and limiting options(max.print=...) may not help in
your case.

Dear all,

I'm puzzled by this error. When running tcrossprod() within the function it
returns the error message. The code also outputs the object a and b.
Running the tcrossprod() outside of the function works as expected.

        cat("a <-")
        dput(a)
        cat("b <-")
        dput(b)
        cat("tcrossprod(a, b)")
        tcrossprod(a, b)

a <-structure(c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
0, 0, 1), dim = c(10L, 2L), dimnames = list(c("9", "13", "21",
"29", "30", "37", "52", "53", "56", "70"),
c("tmp2028c70ae152b4c63bb7ab902158b408366217581",
"tmp2028c70ae152b4c63bb7ab902158b408366217582")), assign = c(1L,
1L), contrasts = list(tmp2028c70ae152b4c63bb7ab902158b40836621758 =
"contr.treatment"))
b <-structure(c(-0.916362039446752, -0.849801808879291, -0.744535398206787,
0.875896407785924, 0.822587420283086, 0.894210774042389), dim = 3:2)

For those how like a fully reproducible example:
the offending line in the code:

a (failing) unit test for the code:

No an interrupt does not help, unfortunately.

I'll just try be more careful.

Setting options(error = recover) and evaluating your test expression
directly using
eval(parse('testthat/test_ccc_hurdle_impute.R')[[1]][[3]]), I see:

Browse[1]> names(random)
[1] "Year"
Browse[1]> paste("~0 + ", 'Year') |>
+ as.formula() |>
+ model.matrix(data = data[missing_obs,]) |>
+ str()
 num [1:68, 1] 7 6 9 4 3 5 10 1 6 8 ...
 - attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2
  ..$ : chr [1:68] "37" "56" "59" "114" ...
  ..$ : chr "Year"
 - attr(*, "assign")= int 1
Browse[1]> t(random[['Year']]) |> str()
 num [1:19, 1:10] 0.175 0.181 0.102 0.119 0.158 ...

...and they are indeed non-conformable. Why is random$Year a matrix?

Hello Stephen.
I am not sure of the exact details of your problem, but following the 
second part of your e-mail, if you accidentally print a large object in 
the console and do not want to wait (i.e. you want to stop printing), 
just press C-c C-c and it will stop it (it will stop any process 
happening in the console, the same if you send a loong loop and want to 
abort...)
cheers
F.

Subject: [R] "And" condition spanning over multiple columns in data frame
Message-ID: <CAKFaUKjpkLO_xoxN6rBfdRtvEDazjMFGbo8wRXyv-m6CRfyKKQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear contributors,
I need to create a set of columns, based on conditions of a dataframe as
follows.
I have managed to do the trick for one column, but I do not seem to find
any good example where the condition is extended to all the dataframe.

I have these dataframe called c10Dt:



id cp1 cp2 cp3 cp4 cp5 cp6 cp7 cp8 cp9 cp10 cp11 cp12
1  1  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA   NA   NA   NA
2  4   8  18  15  10  12  11   9  18   8   16   15   NA
3  3   8   5   5   4  NA   5  NA   6  NA   10   10   10
4  3   5   5   4   4   3   2   1   3   2    1    1    2
5  1  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA   NA   NA   NA
6  2   5   5  10  10   9  10  10  10  NA   10    9   10
-- 

Columns are id, cp1, cp2.. and so on.

What I need to do is the following, made on just one column:

c10Dt <-  mutate(c10Dt, exit1= ifelse(is.na(cp1) & id!=1, 1, 0))

So, I create a new variable, called exit1, in which the program selects
cp1, checks if it is NA, and if it is NA but also the value of the column
"id" is not 1, then it gives back a 1, otherwise 0.
So, what I want is that it selects all the cases in which the id=2,3, or 4
is not NA in the corresponding values of the matrix.
I managed to do it manually column by column, but I feel there should be
something smarter here.

The problem is that I need to replicate this over all the columns from cp2,
to cp12, but keeping fixed the id column instead.

I have tried with

c10Dt %>%
  mutate(x=across(starts_with("cp"), ~ifelse(. == NA)) & id!=1,1,0 )

but the problem with across is that it will implement the condition only on
cp_ columns. How do I tell R to use the column id with all the other
columns?


Thanks for any help provided.

Since all your columns except the first one are the desired "cp*"
columns, you can obtain your "exit" columns in bulk:

(
 c10Dt$id != 1 & # will be recycled column-wise, as we need
 is.na(c10Dt[-1])
) |>
# ...and then convert back into a data.frame,
as.data.frame() |>
# rename the columns...
(\(x) setNames(x, sub('cp', 'exit', names(x))))() |>
# ...and finally attach to the original data.frame
cbind(c10Dt)

Hi,
To rephrase what you are trying to do, you want a copy of all the cp
columns, in which all the NAs become 1s and any other value becomes a
zero. There is an exception for the first row, where the NAs should
become 0s.

a <- c10Dt
b <- matrix(as.numeric(is.na(a[,-1])), nrow=nrow(a))
b[1,] <- 0  # first row gets special treatment
colnames(b) <- paste0("exit",1:ncol(b))
d <- cbind(a,b)
d

Hello,

Something like this?

1. If an ifelse instruction is meant to create a binary result, coerce 
the logical condition to integer instead. You can make it more clear by 
substituting as.integer for the plus sign below;
2. the .names argument is used to create new columns and keeping the 
original ones.



df1 <- read.table(text = "id cp1 cp2 cp3 cp4 cp5 cp6 cp7 cp8 cp9 cp10 
cp11 cp12
1  1  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA   NA   NA   NA
2  4   8  18  15  10  12  11   9  18   8   16   15   NA
3  3   8   5   5   4  NA   5  NA   6  NA   10   10   10
4  3   5   5   4   4   3   2   1   3   2    1    1    2
5  1  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA  NA   NA   NA   NA
6  2   5   5  10  10   9  10  10  10  NA   10    9   10", header = TRUE)
df1

library(dplyr)

df1 %>%
   mutate(across(starts_with("cp"),  ~ +(is.na(.) & id != 1), .names = 
"{col}_new"))



Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

I'm wondering whether ? if this indeed gets opened up ? it might also
make sense to calculate <double> x / <complex> y using real arithmetic
(as x*y / |y|?)

That's not the correct formula, is it?  I think the result should be x * 
Conj(y) / Mod(y)^2 . So that would involve <double> * <complex> and 
<complex> / <double>, not just real arithmetic.

Subject: [R] how to specify point symbols in the key on a lattice dotplot
Message-ID: <20240912211053.17549527@rcw-lm203c>

I am making a dotplot with lattice, as follows:

dd %>% dotplot( segment ~ transit_time, groups = impact,  data = .,
               as.table = TRUE,
                pch = 16:17,
                cex = 1.8,
                scales = list(cex = 1.4),
               auto.key = TRUE)

impact is a factor with two levels.

They key shows 2 open circles, one of each color of my two
plotting symbols, one for each group. I would like the
symbols in the key to match the plotting characters in the graph: 16
(filled circle) for one group and 17 (filled triangle) for the second
group.  How would I do that? I have not had any success with supplying
arguments to auto.key, simpleKey, or key. Guess I'm not understanding
the syntax.

Thanks.

Add:

key = list(points=16:17)

Into the dotplot section possibly without the autokey

Specifying key = list(...) will work, but the shortcut is to add

par.settings = simpleTheme(pch = 16:17, cex = 1.8)

That way, you don't need to specify the parameters anywhere else.

Correct, sorry. And thanks.

Not an expert, but I don't see it. Conj and Mod seem to be numerically
straightforward real-like operations. We do those, and then multiply
one complex number by one real quotient.

produces the desired result.

Why does key = list(points = 16:17)  not work?  Below is a MWE:

================================

library(lattice)
library(dplyr)
dd <- structure(list(impact = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 
2L), levels = c("impaction", "no impaction"), class = "factor"), 
    segment = structure(c(4L, 2L, 1L, 3L, 4L, 2L, 1L, 3L), levels =
c("left", "right", "rectosigmoid", "total"), class = c("ordered",
"factor" )), transit_time = c(70, 10, 20, 32, 42, 10, 12, 18)), class =
"data.frame", row.names = c(NA, -8L))

dd %>% dotplot( segment ~ transit_time, groups = impact,  data = .,
               pch = 16:17,
               cex = 1.8,
               scales = list(cex = 1.4),
               key = list(points = 16:17) )

=================================

Are you sure?  We aren't dealing with real numbers and complex numbers 
here, we're dealing with those sets extended with infinities and other 
weird things.

I think the formula I gave assumes no infinities.

So for example if y is some kind of infinite complex number, then 1/y 
should come out to zero, and if x is finite, the final result of x/y 
should be zero.

But if we evaluate x/y as (x / Mod(y)^2) * Conj(y), won't we get a NaN 
from zero times infinity?

I imagine someone has thought about all these edge cases.  Maybe they're 
discussed in one of the standards that Richard referenced.

"Why does key = list(points = 16:17)  not work? "

Because, from the "key" section of ?xyplot
" The contents of the key are determined by (possibly repeated)
components named "rectangles", "lines", "points" or "text". Each of
these must be **lists** with relevant graphical parameters (see later)
controlling their appearance."

Ergo, try:

dd |> dotplot( segment ~ transit_time, groups = impact,  data = .,
                pch = 16:17,
                cex = 1.8,
                scales = list(cex = 1.4),
                key = list(points = list(pch =16:17) ))

Oh, and for correct syntax with R's |> operator, "data = ." , should
be "data = _" ; although the former seemed to work.

For me, Bert's suggestion produces a plot with two black symbols above
the plotting region, a circle and a triangle, both filled, and no text.

This, in which I specify several features of the symbols in the key,

dd %>%  dotplot( segment ~ transit_time, groups = impact,  data = .,
                pch = 16:17,
                col = 1:2,
                cex = 1.8,
                scales = list(cex = 1.4),
                key = list(text = list(c("impaction", "no impaction")),
points = list(pch =16:17, col = 1:2) ))

gets me what I want.

When using key = (), is it necessary to specify all features of the
plotting symbols and the text? I was under the impression that auto.key
and/or simpleKey (which I'd also tried) had certain defaults, but one or
more of those defaults could be changed by providing arguments, with all
unspecified features remaining at their respective defaults.  

Thanks.

Definitely not sure, just thought I would suggest it as a possibility.

Yes, and it's not trivial to work around, so probably not worth it.

Thanks,
