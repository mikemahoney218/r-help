Yes, this file exists and when I launch it, a new functionally-working R terminal window pops up.

For 2., I also added the Process name "Rterm.exe"
Here are the outputs from Process Monitor for each situation.
In the first situation, I run the command tools::Rcmd('SHLIB --help') from within R (launched by clicking on the R icon). I get:
Process Name: Rcmd.exe
PID: 8204
Path: C:\WINDOWS\System32\Conhost.exe
Result: SUCCESS
Detail: PID: 4028, Command line: \??\C:\WINDOWS\system32\conhost.exe 0xffffffff -ForceV1

In the second situation, I run the command tools::Rcmd('SHLIB --help') from the R terminal (launched by clicking on Rterm.exe). I get:
Process Name: Rterm.exe
PID: 14596
Path: C:\PROGRA~1\R\R-43~1.1\bin\x64\Rcmd.exe
Result: SUCCESS
Detail: PID: 6820, Command line: C:\PROGRA~1\R\R-43~1.1\bin\x64\Rcmd.exe SHLIB --help

Best regards,
Christophe

I'll be honest with you: I still don't understand what's going on.

Thank you for confirming that your filter works (seeing Rcmd.exe
launched when you run tools::Rcmd() from Rterm.exe is the expected
behaviour), but I don't know enough about Windows internals to come up
with an explanation for the observed behaviour.

If you're up to compiling R from source [*] and using a symbolic
debugger [**] to step through Rcmd.exe, we could try to do that.
Murphy's law says that the copy of Rcmd.exe you'll build from source
will work well and refuse to reproduce the problem for you to
investigate. (Beyond that, there is binary-level debugging, which I'm
not well versed in.)

Yes that is helpful. Everything goes inside the function

HI Jeff,
This might give you a start.

add_stuff<-function(x) {
 x<-xinc<-NA
 finished<-FALSE
 while(is.na(x))
  x<-as.numeric(readline("What number do you want to start? "))
 while(is.na(xinc) || !finished) {
  xinc<-as.numeric(readline("What number do you want to add? "))
  if(is.numeric(xinc)) x<-x+xinc
  answer<-unlist(strsplit(readline("Do you want to keep doing this?
(y/n) "),""))[1]
  finished<-toupper(answer)!="Y"
 }
 return(x)
}
