Yes, this file exists and when I launch it, a new functionally-working R terminal window pops up.

For 2., I also added the Process name "Rterm.exe"
Here are the outputs from Process Monitor for each situation.
In the first situation, I run the command tools::Rcmd('SHLIB --help') from within R (launched by clicking on the R icon). I get:
Process Name: Rcmd.exe
PID: 8204
Path: C:\WINDOWS\System32\Conhost.exe
Result: SUCCESS
Detail: PID: 4028, Command line: \??\C:\WINDOWS\system32\conhost.exe 0xffffffff -ForceV1

In the second situation, I run the command tools::Rcmd('SHLIB --help') from the R terminal (launched by clicking on Rterm.exe). I get:
Process Name: Rterm.exe
PID: 14596
Path: C:\PROGRA~1\R\R-43~1.1\bin\x64\Rcmd.exe
Result: SUCCESS
Detail: PID: 6820, Command line: C:\PROGRA~1\R\R-43~1.1\bin\x64\Rcmd.exe SHLIB --help

Best regards,
Christophe

I'll be honest with you: I still don't understand what's going on.

Thank you for confirming that your filter works (seeing Rcmd.exe
launched when you run tools::Rcmd() from Rterm.exe is the expected
behaviour), but I don't know enough about Windows internals to come up
with an explanation for the observed behaviour.

If you're up to compiling R from source [*] and using a symbolic
debugger [**] to step through Rcmd.exe, we could try to do that.
Murphy's law says that the copy of Rcmd.exe you'll build from source
will work well and refuse to reproduce the problem for you to
investigate. (Beyond that, there is binary-level debugging, which I'm
not well versed in.)

HI Jeff,
This might give you a start.

add_stuff<-function(x) {
 x<-xinc<-NA
 finished<-FALSE
 while(is.na(x))
  x<-as.numeric(readline("What number do you want to start? "))
 while(is.na(xinc) || !finished) {
  xinc<-as.numeric(readline("What number do you want to add? "))
  if(is.numeric(xinc)) x<-x+xinc
  answer<-unlist(strsplit(readline("Do you want to keep doing this?
(y/n) "),""))[1]
  finished<-toupper(answer)!="Y"
 }
 return(x)
}

Sounds like you need to install gfortran:
https://mac.r-project.org/tools/

If that doesn't help, consider asking at r-sig-mac at r-project.org, a
"special interest group" for everything related to R on macOS.

Subject: [R] [Pkg-Collaboratos] BioShapes Almost-Package
Message-ID: <47278c28-0646-3e35-4a50-3d2edf15bd9f@syonic.eu>

Dear R-List Members,

I am looking for collaborators to further develop the BioShapes 
almost-package. I added a brief description below.

A.) BioShapes (Almost-) Package

The aim of the BioShapes quasi-package is to facilitate the generation 
of graphical objects resembling biological and chemical entities, 
enabling the construction of diagrams based on these objects. It 
currently includes functions to generate diagrams depicting viral 
particles, liposomes, double helix / DNA strands, various cell types 
(like neurons, brush-border cells and duct cells), Ig-domains, as well 
as more basic shapes.

It should offer researchers in the field of biological and chemical 
sciences a tool to easily generate diagrams depicting the studied 
biological processes.

The package lacks a proper documentation and is not yet released on 
CRAN. However, it is available on GitHub:
https://github.com/discoleo/BioShapes

Although there are 27 unique cloners on GitHub, I am still looking for 
contributors and collaborators. I would appreciate any collaborations to 
develop it further. I can be contacted both by email and on GitHub.


B.) Documentation Tools

Is there a succinct, but sufficiently informative description of 
documentation tools?
I find that including the documentation in the source files is very 
distracting. I would prefer to have only basic comments in the source 
files and an expanded documentation in a separate location.

This question may be more appropriate for the R-package-devel list. I 
can move the 2nd question to that list.

###

As the biological sciences are very vast, I would be very happy for 
collaborators on the development of this package. Examples with existing 
shapes are available in (but are unfortunately not documented):

Man/examples/Examples.Man.R
R/Examples.R
R/Examples.Cells.R
tests/experimental/*


Many thanks,

Leonard

1. R-package-devel is where queries about package protocols should go.

2. But...
"Is there a succinct, but sufficiently informative description of
documentation tools?"
"Writing R Extensions" (shipped with R) is *the* reference for R
documentation. Whether it's sufficiently "succinct" for you, I cannot say.

"I find that including the documentation in the source files is very
distracting."
?? R documentation (.Rd) files are separate from source (.R) files. Inline
documentation in source files is an "add-on" capability provided by
optional packages if one prefers to do this. Such packages parse the source
files to extract the documentation into the .Rd files/ So not sure what you
mean here. Apologies if I have misunderstood.

" I would prefer to have only basic comments in the source
files and an expanded documentation in a separate location."
If I understand you correctly, this is exactly what the R package process
specifies. Again, see the "Writing R Extensions" manual for details.

Also, if you wish to have your package on CRAN, it requires that the
package documents all functions in the package as specified by the "Writing
..." manual.

Again, further questions and elaboration should go to the R-package-devel
list, although I think the manual is really the authoritative resource to
follow.

Cheers,
Bert

Thank you Bert.


Clarification:

Indeed, I am using an add-on package: it is customary for that package - 
that is what I have seen - to have the entire documentation included as 
comments in the R src files. (But maybe I am wrong.)


I will try to find some time over the next few days to explore in more 
detail the R documentation. Although, I do not know how this will 
interact with the add-on package.


Sincerely,


Leonard

Leonard... the reason roxygen exists is to allow markup in source files to be used to automatically generate the numerous files required by standard R packages as documented in Writing R Extensions.

If your goal is to not use source files this way then the solution is to not use roxygen at all. Just create those files yourself by directly editing them from scratch.

Just a bit of elaboration on Jeff's suggestion -- here's the workflow I 
prefer to using Roxygen.

Once you have a function that works:

1.  install the package
2.  set your working directory to the package "man" directory
3.  run `prompt(functionname)`
4.  edit `functionname.Rd` in the "man" directory, which will already be 
filled in as a skeleton help file, with comments describing what else to 
add.

Don't run prompt() again after editing, or you'll lose all your edits. 
But this is a good way to get started.

I think for the first few times the comments are really helpful, but I 
wouldn't mind a way to suppress them.

1) Simple aggregation with 2 variables:
aggregate(cbind(Length, Width) ~ RAWMAT, data = my_data, FUN = mean,

2) Using the dot notation - different results:
aggregate(. ~ RAWMAT, data = my_data[-1], FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)

3) Using dplyr, I get the same results as #1:
group_by(my_data, RAWMAT) %>%
 ? summarise(across(c("Length", "Width"), ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)))

4) It gets weirder: using all columns in #1 give the same results as in 
#2 but different from #1 and #3
aggregate(cbind(EdgeLength, SurfaceArea, Length, Width, PLATWIDTH, 
PLATTHICK, EPA, THICKNESS, WEIGHT) ~ RAWMAT, data = my_data, FUN = mean, 
na.rm = TRUE)

So it seems it is not only due to the notation (cbind() vs. dot). Is it 
a bug? A peculiar thing in my dataset? I tend to think this could be due 
to some variables (or their names) as all notations seem to agree when I 
remove some variables (although I haven't found out which variable(s) is 
(are) at fault), e.g.:

my_data2 <- structure(list(ID = c("FLINT-1", "FLINT-10", "FLINT-100",

It seems that the issue are the missings. If in  #1 you use the dataset na.omit(my_data) instead of my_data, you get the same output that in #2 and in #4, where all observations with missing data are removed since you are including all the variables.


The second dataset has no issue since it has no missing data.

Thanks Iago for the pointer.


It then means that na.rm = TRUE is not applied in the same way within 
aggregate() as opposed to dplyr::group_by() + summarise(), right? Within 
aggregate, it behaves like na.omit(), that is, it excludes the 
incomplete cases (whole rows), whereas with group_by() + summarise() it 
is applied on each vector (variable), which is what I actually would expect.


I hadn't showed it, but doBy::summaryBy() produces the same results as 
group_by() + summarise().

Error in curl::curl_fetch_memory(file) :
Timeout was reached: [raw.githubusercontent.com] Failed to connect to
raw.githubusercontent.com port 443 after 5250 ms: Timed out

The R-code is as below:

library(tidyverse)
library(rio)

data <- import("
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siddharth-sahasrabudhe/Youtube-video-files/main/deck.csv
")

Can you please suggest how I can able to resolve this issue?

Yes. Many experienced R programmers do not use Roxygen
(or use it only rarely; e.g., together with ESS (Emacs Speaks
 Statistics) to make the initial creation or sometime a thorough
 updating the help pages  man/*.Rd more convenient).

There are different tastes and different work flows for
different people.

Me neither.  A new option, not changing the default, would make sense.

Hello,

You can define a vector of the columns of interest and subset the data 
with it. Then the default na.action = na.omit will no longer remove the 
rows with NA vals in at least one column and the results are the same.

However, this will not give the mean values of the other numeric 
columns, just of those two.



# define a vector of columns of interest
cols <- c("Length", "Width", "RAWMAT")

# 1) Simple aggregation with 2 variables, select cols:
aggregate(cbind(Length, Width) ~ RAWMAT, data = my_data[cols], FUN = 
mean, na.rm = TRUE)

# 2) Using the dot notation - if cols are selected, equal results:
aggregate(. ~ RAWMAT, data = my_data[cols], FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)

# 3) Using dplyr, the results are now the same results as #1 and #2:
my_data %>%
   select(all_of(cols)) %>%
   group_by(RAWMAT) %>%
   summarise(across(c("Length", "Width"), ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)))


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Thanks Rui for your help; that would be one possibility indeed.

But am I the only one who finds that behavior of aggregate() completely 
unexpected and confusing? Especially considering that dplyr::summarise() 
and doBy::summaryBy() deal with NAs differently, even though they all 
use mean(na.rm = TRUE) to calculate the group stats.

Best wishes,
Ivan

Hello,

Puzzling at first yes, unexpected no, it's documented behavior.

This is the result of how the aggregate works, by first applying 
na.action to the data and only then applying the function to each column 
in the formula's LHS.

dplyr works column by column, so there is no na.action involved.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Dear Ivan,

Yes, I would be up for trying, but this week I need to finish some stuff before going on holidays.
I will try compiling R from source when I am back from holidays, and ask you if I need assistance.

Many thanks again for trying to solve this issue.

Best regards,
Christophe

Haha, got it now, there is an na.action argument (which defaults to 
na.omit) to aggregate() which is applied before calling mean(na.rm = 
TRUE). Thank you Rui for pointing this out.

So running it with na.pass instead of na.omit gives the same results as 
dplyr::group_by()+summarise():
aggregate(. ~ RAWMAT, data = my_data[-1], FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE, 
na.action = na.pass)

Cheers,
Ivan

Subject: [R] Finding combination of states
Message-ID: <CA+dpOJk6kzWbPa7zba_51yMFLpeyXYzWWkYY-63-r5Y50C1mzw@mail.gmail.com>

Let say I have 3 time points.as T0, T1, and T2.(number of such time
points can be arbitrary) In each time point, an object can be any of 5
states, A, B, C, D, E (number of such states can be arbitrary)

I need to find all possible ways, how that object starting with state
B (say) at time T0, can be on state E (example) in time T2

For example one possibility is BAE etc.

Is there any function available with R, that can give me a vector of
such possibilities for arbitrary number of states, time, and for a
given initial and final (desired) states?

ANy pointer will be very appreciated.

Thanks for your time.

Yes: You used the wrong "file name", because you added a
     <newline> / <linebreak> 
     on both ends by breaking the line.

This works nicely:

Thank you very much for all the responses; especially Duncan's guidance. 
I will add some further ideas on workflows below.

There were quite a few views on GitHub; but there is not much to see, as 
there is absolutely no documentation.? I have added in the meantime a 
basic example:
https://github.com/discoleo/BioShapes/blob/main/Examples.Bioshapes.png
The actual code can do a lot more.

############

Some ideas on workflows:

1. Most code is written as C/C++; the R code is a thin wrapper around 
the C/C++ functions
It is practical to embed the documentation with the R code - as there is 
no complex code anyway. The same may apply for small packages.

2. Complex R code
The comments may clutter the code. It is also difficult to maintain this 
documentation, as the comments are less easily readable. Separating the 
documentation from the code is a good idea.

Unfortunately, this is not so obvious when you start working on your 
first package.

Many thanks,

Leonard

The function purrr::cross() can help you with this. For example:

f <- function(states, nsteps, first, last) {
   paste(first, unlist(lapply(purrr::cross(rep(list(v),nsteps-2)),
\(x) paste(unlist(x), collapse=""))), last, sep="")
}
f(LETTERS[1:5], 3, "B", "E")
[1] "BAE" "BBE" "BCE" "BDE" "BEE"

Ivan:
Just one perhaps extraneous comment.

You said that you were surprised that aggregate() and group_by() did not
have the same behavior. That is a misconception on your part. As you know,
the tidyverse recapitulates the functionality of many base R functions; but
it makes no claims to do so in exactly the same way and, indeed, often
makes deliberate changes to "improve" behavior. So if you wish to use both,
you should *expect* such differences, which, of course, are documented in
the man pages (and often elsewhere).

Cheers,
Bert

Make sure to compile with DEBUG=1 so that the compiler flags needed to

The function purrr::cross() can help you with this. For example:

f <- function(states, nsteps, first, last) {
   paste(first, unlist(lapply(purrr::cross(rep(list(v),nsteps-2)),
\(x) paste(unlist(x), collapse=""))), last, sep="") } f(LETTERS[1:5], 3, "B", "E") [1] "BAE" "BBE" "BCE" "BDE" "BEE"

I think there may be some uncertainty here about what the OP requested. My
interpretation is:

n different times
k different states
Any state can appear at any time in the vector of times and can be repeated
Initial and final states are given

So modifying Tim's expand.grid() solution a bit yields:

g <- function(ntimes, states, init, final){
   ## ntimes: integer, number of unique times
   ## states: vector of unique states
   ## init: initial state
   ## final: final state
do.call(paste0,c(init,expand.grid(rep(list(states), ntimes-2)), final))
}

e.g.

> g(4, LETTERS[1:5], "B", "D")
 [1] "BAAD" "BBAD" "BCAD" "BDAD" "BEAD" "BABD" "BBBD" "BCBD"
 [9] "BDBD" "BEBD" "BACD" "BBCD" "BCCD" "BDCD" "BECD" "BADD"
[17] "BBDD" "BCDD" "BDDD" "BEDD" "BAED" "BBED" "BCED" "BDED"
[25] "BEED"

If neither this nor any of the other suggestions is not what is desired, I
think the OP will have to clarify his query.

Cheers,
Bert

My initial response was buggy and also used a deprecated function.
Also, it seems possible that one may want to rule out any strings where the
same state appears consecutively.
I say that such a string has a repeat.

myExpand <- function(v, n) {
  do.call(tidyr::expand_grid, replicate(n, v, simplify = FALSE))
}

no_repeat <- function(s) {
  v <- unlist(strsplit(s, NULL))
  sum(v[-1]==v[-length(v)]) == 0
}

f <- function(states, nsteps, first, last, rm_repeat=TRUE) {
  if (nsteps < 3) stop("nsteps must be at least 3")
    out <- paste(first,
          myExpand(states, nsteps-2) |>
            apply(MAR=1, \(x) paste(x, collapse="")),
          last, sep="")
    if (rm_repeat) {
      ok <- sapply(out, no_repeat)
      out <- out[ok]
    }
    out
}

f(LETTERS[1:5],4,"B","E")

#  [1] "BABE" "BACE" "BADE" "BCAE" "BCBE" "BCDE" "BDAE" "BDBE" "BDCE"
"BEAE" "BEBE" "BECE" "BEDE"

Well, if strings with repeats (as you defined them) are to be excluded, I
think it's simple just to use regular expressions to remove them.

e.g.
g <- function(ntimes, states, init, final, repeats = TRUE)
   ## ntimes: integer, number of unique times
   ## states: vector of unique states
   ## init: initial state
   ## final: final state
{
out <- do.call(paste0,c(init,expand.grid(rep(list(states), ntimes-2)),
final))
if(!repeats)
   out[-grep(paste(paste0(states,states),  collapse = "|"),out)]
else out
}
So:

> g(4, LETTERS[1:5], "B", "E", repeats = FALSE)
 [1] "BCAE" "BDAE" "BEAE" "BABE" "BCBE" "BDBE" "BEBE" "BACE"
 [9] "BDCE" "BECE" "BADE" "BCDE" "BEDE"

Perhaps not the most efficient way to do this, of course.

Cheers,
Bert

I agree with Rui that this behaves as documented but I also agree with 
Ivan that the behavior is potentially confusing. Not so much because other 
packages behave differently but mostly because the handling of missing 
values differs between the different aggregate() methods.

Based on my teaching experience, I feel that a default of 
na.action=na.pass would be less confusing, especially in the case with 
multivariate "response".

In the univeriate case the discrepancy can be surprising - in the default 
method you need na.rm=TRUE but in the formula method you get the same 
result without additional arguments (due to na.action=na.omit). But in the 
multivariate case the discrepancy is not obvious, especially for 
beginners, because the results in other variables without NAs are affected 
as well.

A minimal toy example is the following data with two groups (x = A vs. B) 
and two "responses" (y without NAs and z with NA):

d <- data.frame(x = c("A", "A", "B", "B"), y = 1:4, z = c(1:3, NA))
d
##   x y  z
## 1 A 1  1
## 2 A 2  2
## 3 B 3  3
## 4 B 4 NA

Except for naming of the columns, both of the following summaries for y by 
x (without NAs) yield the same result:

aggregate(d$y, list(d$x), FUN = mean)
aggregate(y ~ x, data = d, FUN = mean)
##   x   y
## 1 A 1.5
## 2 B 3.5

For a single variable _with_ NAs, the default method needs the na.rm = 
TRUE argument, the fomula method does not. Again, except for naming of the 
columns:

aggregate(d$z, list(d$x), FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
aggregate(z ~ x, data = d, FUN = mean)
##   x   z
## 1 A 1.5
## 2 B 3.0

Conversely, if you do want the NAs in the groups, the following two are 
the same (except for naming):

aggregate(d$z, list(d$x), FUN = mean)
aggregate(z ~ x, data = d, FUN = mean, na.action = na.pass)
##   x   z
## 1 A 1.5
## 2 B  NA

But in the multivariate case, it is not so obvious why the following two 
commands differ in their results for y (!), the variable without NAs, in 
group B:

aggregate(d[, c("y", "z")], list(d$x), FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
##   Group.1   y   z
## 1       A 1.5 1.5
## 2       B 3.5 3.0
              ^^^

aggregate(cbind(y, z) ~ x, data = d, FUN = mean)
##   x   y   z
## 1 A 1.5 1.5
## 2 B 3.0 3.0
        ^^^

Hence, in my programming courses I tell students to use na.action=na.pass 
in the formula method and to handle NAs in the FUN argument themselves.

I guess that this is not important enough to change the default in 
aggregate.formula. Or are there R core members who also find that this 
inconsistency between the different methods is worth addressing?

If not, maybe an explicit example could be added on the help page? Showing 
something like this might help:

## default: omit enitre row 4 where z=NA
aggregate(cbind(y, z) ~ x, data = d, FUN = mean)
##   x   y   z
## 1 A 1.5 1.5
## 2 B 3.0 3.0

## alternatively: omit row 4 only for z result but not for y result
aggregate(cbind(y, z) ~ x, data = d, FUN = mean, na.action = na.pass, na.rm = TRUE)
##   x   y   z
## 1 A 1.5 1.5
## 2 B 3.5 3.0

Best wishes,
Achim

... and just for fun, here is a non-string version (more appropriate for
complex state labels??):

gvec <- function(ntimes, states, init, final, repeats = TRUE)
   ## ntimes: integer, number of unique times
   ## states: vector of unique states
   ## init: initial state
   ## final: final state
{
   out <- cbind(init,
            as.matrix(expand.grid(rep(list(states),ntimes -2 ))),final)
   if(!repeats)
     out[ apply(out,1,\(x)all(x[-1] != x[-ntimes])), ]
   else out
}

yielding:

      init Var1 Var2 final

Subject: [R] Error in analysis of arguments of Rasch
Message-ID: <CAEU20u1KT1Ts0fvL0VEAUtnnZmxc3=1PWviiTgq8P06KLqip+w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

I am using ltm and eRm package in analysing my polytomous data for fitting
item response theory and Rasch model, respectively.

I'm having a problem with the error as below;

> library(eRm)
> library(ltm)
> HT <- read.csv("C:/Dropbox/Analysis R_2023/HT.csv")
> response_columns <- HT[, 1:ncol(HT)]
> response_matrix <- as.matrix(response_columns)
> irt_model <- grm(response_matrix)
> rasch_model <- Rasch(response_matrix)
Error in Rasch(response_matrix) : could not find function "Rasch"

Then I changed the arguments of Rasch to RM, but it also turns out an error
as below;

> rasch_model <- RM(response_matrix)
Error in datcheck(X, W, mpoints, groupvec, model) :
  Dichotomous data matrix required!

Is there any problem with the arguments or any other problem with my coding
since errors keep occurring when I want to run Rasch.

Thank you very much for any help given.

Azi.

Hi Bert,
I really liked your solution.
In the spirit of code golf, I wondered if there is a shorter way to do
the regular expression test.
Kudos to my coding buddy GPT-4 for the following:

You can replace your statement

out[-grep(paste(paste0(states,states),  collapse = "|"),out)]

by

out[-grep("(.)\\1",out)]

Best,
Eric

Hi all,

I have these data

x1 <- c(116,0,115,137,127,0,0)
x2 <- c(0,159,0,0,0,159,127)

I want : xx <- c(116,115,137,127,159, 127)

I would like to merge these data into one column. Whenever the data is '0'
it will be replaced by the value in the column which is non zero..
I tried append and merge but fail to get what I want.

Hello,

That's a case for ?pmax:


x1 <- c(116,0,115,137,127,0,0)
x2 <- c(0,159,0,0,0,159,127)
pmax(x1, x2)
#> [1] 116 159 115 137 127 159 127


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Others have pointed out pmax(x1, x2).  For the sample data, even x1+x2 
would give the same answer.

The real question is what you want to do if both x1 and x2 have non-zero 
entries, or negative entries:

   pmax(x1, x2)

will pick the larger one.  It might be zero if the other is negative, 
and that doesn't match your description.

   x1+x2

will just give the sum, which doesn't match your description if both are 
non-zero.

But maybe you want the x1 value unless it is zero, even if it is smaller 
than the x2 value:  then you would use

   ifelse(x1 != 0, x1, x2)

Similarly

   ifelse(x2 != 0, x2, x1)

would prefer the x2 value.

You should think about what you would do in these other cases as well.

Oh I liked that.

I was actually thinking about something similar, but couldn't figure it
out.  The idiom you showed is very clever imo and taught me something about
regexes that I never properly understood.

As Duncan points out, ifelse() provides a more general approach than
the specific pmax().

Even more generally, you might want to consider the apply() function
(and its relatives sapply(), lapply(), ...)

For example

apply(cbind(x1,x2), MAR=1, max)

In the above statement, x1 and x2 are combined into two columns, MAR=1
says apply the following function to each row,
and max specifies the function to be applied. The summary is that this
statement applies the max to each row in the object
specified by the first argument. It's very general because you can
replace max by an arbitrary function.

Similarly, if you get more into R you might modify the above using
chained operations. The following rewrites the above
by piping cbind(x1,x2) into the apply command. Not a necessary feature
to know but eventually will assist you in writing code that does
not require a lot of intermediate variables.

cbind(x1,x2) |> apply(MAR=1,max)

Hi,

I am Sukriti Sood, a research analyst at Woodstock Institute <https://woodstockinst.org/> . I use RStudio extensively for our analysis. I have been facing two issues for a while:


  1.  I am unable to copy from RStudio and paste into or vice versa to any other programs.
  2.  I am facing some kind of a conversion error (screenshot attached).

I tried looking up online however could not find a resolution to these issues. Could I please get some help with this urgently.

Thanks!

Best,
Sukriti Sood

R is not RStudio. RStudio is not R.

RStudio helps you work with R, but to do so it "types" in some commands behind the scenes. I suspect those errors are because you have a pairing of versions of RStudio with a version of R that the RStudio team did not test.

Someone here might be able to help, but the most likely way to encounter someone who knows what bugs RStudio has is to ask in the RStudio support area [1].

Hello,

You should post RStudio questions to the RStudio support service, they 
answer quickly and the answers are generally good.

It's written at the bottom of the attached image that the workspace was 
loaded from file


C:/WSI/.RData


Close RStudio, remove this file and restart. See if it solved it.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Sounds like something weird happened to your installation of the knitr package. It could help to reinstall it. If you don't have anything valuable saved in %userprofile%\.RData, it may be worth moving it away, because it may be carrying a part of the broken state. (Saving state in .RData may be convenient, but it may hurt the reproducibility of your scripts and persist some of your problems.)

Knitr lives separately from R and RStudio in a "library", most likely under your %userprofile%. Try using install.packages to install it anew.

Can you load knitr from an RGui session? If yes, the problem might be elsewhere.

Subject: [R] How to draw plot marks without label?
Message-ID: <CAMk+s2Q2KAuh5gtkQ54q7NiY4rdLACu1XfjdFd0iV2TVNC-XCQ@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to draw a graph where the y-lables are missing but the
marks still present.
In this example, I get marks from 20000 to 140 000 with increments of
20 000. I could use `plot(... yaxt="n"...)` combined with `axis(2,
at..., label="")` but this needs to know exactly the sequence of marks
provided by plot. But this sequence might change.

Thus is there a way to plot the marks without labels?
Also, is it possible to draw the marks on the right side?

Thank you.

```
y = c(42008, 19076, 150576, 48192, 26153, 37931, 36103, 17692,
      61538,41027, 71052, 94571)
df = data.frame(X = c(rep(0, 6), rep(25, 6)), Y = y)
stripchart(df$Y ~ df$X,
           method = "jitter", offset=1/3,
           vertical = TRUE, las=1,
           pch=16, cex=2,
           ylab="Y", xlab="X",
           main="Example")
```

Hi

Do you mean like this ... ?


stripchart(df$Y ~ df$X,
            method = "jitter", offset=1/3,
            vertical = TRUE, las=1,
            pch=16, cex=2,
            ylab="Y", xlab="X",
            main="Example",
            axes=FALSE)
box()
axis(1)
axis(2, labels=FALSE)
axis(4, labels=FALSE)

Luigi:

For base R graphics, you should always consult ?par for optional graphical
parameters when the high level graphics function doesn't appear to provide
the control you would like. I don't use base graphics -- i.e. i"m not
particularly facile with it -- but as you provided an example, I decided to
try to help. I think this is what you may want:

stripchart(
           Y ~ X, data = df,  ## better way to specify data  instead of $
           method = "jitter", offset=1/3,
           vertical = TRUE, las=1,
           pch=16, cex=2,
           ylab="Y", xlab="X",
           yaxt= "n",  ## don't plot y axes
           main="Example")

## Now add y axis on right with default tick mark locations
axis(side = 4, labels = FALSE)

How I got this (you may find this useful to modify the above if I didn't
get what you wanted) was as follows:

stripchart() does not seem to allow the direct control over the axes you
want. The 'axes' parameter help in ?stripchart sent me to?par to see if I
could specify an axis on the right instead of on the left, but it did not
seem to provide such an option. So I decided to use what the yaxt parameter
described to omit the y axis in the high level (stripchart) call, and then
add it back with a subsequent call to axis(). I just used default tick
locations in that call, but you can specify them explicitly as ?axis
describes

Again, if this is not what you wanted, I hope you can use the above to
modify stripchart() to your desired specification.

Cheers,
Bert
