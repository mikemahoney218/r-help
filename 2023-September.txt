Yes, this file exists and when I launch it, a new functionally-working R terminal window pops up.

For 2., I also added the Process name "Rterm.exe"
Here are the outputs from Process Monitor for each situation.
In the first situation, I run the command tools::Rcmd('SHLIB --help') from within R (launched by clicking on the R icon). I get:
Process Name: Rcmd.exe
PID: 8204
Path: C:\WINDOWS\System32\Conhost.exe
Result: SUCCESS
Detail: PID: 4028, Command line: \??\C:\WINDOWS\system32\conhost.exe 0xffffffff -ForceV1

In the second situation, I run the command tools::Rcmd('SHLIB --help') from the R terminal (launched by clicking on Rterm.exe). I get:
Process Name: Rterm.exe
PID: 14596
Path: C:\PROGRA~1\R\R-43~1.1\bin\x64\Rcmd.exe
Result: SUCCESS
Detail: PID: 6820, Command line: C:\PROGRA~1\R\R-43~1.1\bin\x64\Rcmd.exe SHLIB --help

Best regards,
Christophe

I'll be honest with you: I still don't understand what's going on.

Thank you for confirming that your filter works (seeing Rcmd.exe
launched when you run tools::Rcmd() from Rterm.exe is the expected
behaviour), but I don't know enough about Windows internals to come up
with an explanation for the observed behaviour.

If you're up to compiling R from source [*] and using a symbolic
debugger [**] to step through Rcmd.exe, we could try to do that.
Murphy's law says that the copy of Rcmd.exe you'll build from source
will work well and refuse to reproduce the problem for you to
investigate. (Beyond that, there is binary-level debugging, which I'm
not well versed in.)

HI Jeff,
This might give you a start.

add_stuff<-function(x) {
 x<-xinc<-NA
 finished<-FALSE
 while(is.na(x))
  x<-as.numeric(readline("What number do you want to start? "))
 while(is.na(xinc) || !finished) {
  xinc<-as.numeric(readline("What number do you want to add? "))
  if(is.numeric(xinc)) x<-x+xinc
  answer<-unlist(strsplit(readline("Do you want to keep doing this?
(y/n) "),""))[1]
  finished<-toupper(answer)!="Y"
 }
 return(x)
}

Sounds like you need to install gfortran:
https://mac.r-project.org/tools/

If that doesn't help, consider asking at r-sig-mac at r-project.org, a
"special interest group" for everything related to R on macOS.

Subject: [R] [Pkg-Collaboratos] BioShapes Almost-Package
Message-ID: <47278c28-0646-3e35-4a50-3d2edf15bd9f@syonic.eu>

Dear R-List Members,

I am looking for collaborators to further develop the BioShapes 
almost-package. I added a brief description below.

A.) BioShapes (Almost-) Package

The aim of the BioShapes quasi-package is to facilitate the generation 
of graphical objects resembling biological and chemical entities, 
enabling the construction of diagrams based on these objects. It 
currently includes functions to generate diagrams depicting viral 
particles, liposomes, double helix / DNA strands, various cell types 
(like neurons, brush-border cells and duct cells), Ig-domains, as well 
as more basic shapes.

It should offer researchers in the field of biological and chemical 
sciences a tool to easily generate diagrams depicting the studied 
biological processes.

The package lacks a proper documentation and is not yet released on 
CRAN. However, it is available on GitHub:
https://github.com/discoleo/BioShapes

Although there are 27 unique cloners on GitHub, I am still looking for 
contributors and collaborators. I would appreciate any collaborations to 
develop it further. I can be contacted both by email and on GitHub.


B.) Documentation Tools

Is there a succinct, but sufficiently informative description of 
documentation tools?
I find that including the documentation in the source files is very 
distracting. I would prefer to have only basic comments in the source 
files and an expanded documentation in a separate location.

This question may be more appropriate for the R-package-devel list. I 
can move the 2nd question to that list.

###

As the biological sciences are very vast, I would be very happy for 
collaborators on the development of this package. Examples with existing 
shapes are available in (but are unfortunately not documented):

Man/examples/Examples.Man.R
R/Examples.R
R/Examples.Cells.R
tests/experimental/*


Many thanks,

Leonard

1. R-package-devel is where queries about package protocols should go.

2. But...
"Is there a succinct, but sufficiently informative description of
documentation tools?"
"Writing R Extensions" (shipped with R) is *the* reference for R
documentation. Whether it's sufficiently "succinct" for you, I cannot say.

"I find that including the documentation in the source files is very
distracting."
?? R documentation (.Rd) files are separate from source (.R) files. Inline
documentation in source files is an "add-on" capability provided by
optional packages if one prefers to do this. Such packages parse the source
files to extract the documentation into the .Rd files/ So not sure what you
mean here. Apologies if I have misunderstood.

" I would prefer to have only basic comments in the source
files and an expanded documentation in a separate location."
If I understand you correctly, this is exactly what the R package process
specifies. Again, see the "Writing R Extensions" manual for details.

Also, if you wish to have your package on CRAN, it requires that the
package documents all functions in the package as specified by the "Writing
..." manual.

Again, further questions and elaboration should go to the R-package-devel
list, although I think the manual is really the authoritative resource to
follow.

Cheers,
Bert

Thank you Bert.


Clarification:

Indeed, I am using an add-on package: it is customary for that package - 
that is what I have seen - to have the entire documentation included as 
comments in the R src files. (But maybe I am wrong.)


I will try to find some time over the next few days to explore in more 
detail the R documentation. Although, I do not know how this will 
interact with the add-on package.


Sincerely,


Leonard

Leonard... the reason roxygen exists is to allow markup in source files to be used to automatically generate the numerous files required by standard R packages as documented in Writing R Extensions.

If your goal is to not use source files this way then the solution is to not use roxygen at all. Just create those files yourself by directly editing them from scratch.

Just a bit of elaboration on Jeff's suggestion -- here's the workflow I 
prefer to using Roxygen.

Once you have a function that works:

1.  install the package
2.  set your working directory to the package "man" directory
3.  run `prompt(functionname)`
4.  edit `functionname.Rd` in the "man" directory, which will already be 
filled in as a skeleton help file, with comments describing what else to 
add.

Don't run prompt() again after editing, or you'll lose all your edits. 
But this is a good way to get started.

I think for the first few times the comments are really helpful, but I 
wouldn't mind a way to suppress them.

1) Simple aggregation with 2 variables:
aggregate(cbind(Length, Width) ~ RAWMAT, data = my_data, FUN = mean,

2) Using the dot notation - different results:
aggregate(. ~ RAWMAT, data = my_data[-1], FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)

3) Using dplyr, I get the same results as #1:
group_by(my_data, RAWMAT) %>%
 ? summarise(across(c("Length", "Width"), ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)))

4) It gets weirder: using all columns in #1 give the same results as in 
#2 but different from #1 and #3
aggregate(cbind(EdgeLength, SurfaceArea, Length, Width, PLATWIDTH, 
PLATTHICK, EPA, THICKNESS, WEIGHT) ~ RAWMAT, data = my_data, FUN = mean, 
na.rm = TRUE)

So it seems it is not only due to the notation (cbind() vs. dot). Is it 
a bug? A peculiar thing in my dataset? I tend to think this could be due 
to some variables (or their names) as all notations seem to agree when I 
remove some variables (although I haven't found out which variable(s) is 
(are) at fault), e.g.:

my_data2 <- structure(list(ID = c("FLINT-1", "FLINT-10", "FLINT-100",

It seems that the issue are the missings. If in  #1 you use the dataset na.omit(my_data) instead of my_data, you get the same output that in #2 and in #4, where all observations with missing data are removed since you are including all the variables.


The second dataset has no issue since it has no missing data.

Thanks Iago for the pointer.


It then means that na.rm = TRUE is not applied in the same way within 
aggregate() as opposed to dplyr::group_by() + summarise(), right? Within 
aggregate, it behaves like na.omit(), that is, it excludes the 
incomplete cases (whole rows), whereas with group_by() + summarise() it 
is applied on each vector (variable), which is what I actually would expect.


I hadn't showed it, but doBy::summaryBy() produces the same results as 
group_by() + summarise().

Error in curl::curl_fetch_memory(file) :
Timeout was reached: [raw.githubusercontent.com] Failed to connect to
raw.githubusercontent.com port 443 after 5250 ms: Timed out

The R-code is as below:

library(tidyverse)
library(rio)

data <- import("
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siddharth-sahasrabudhe/Youtube-video-files/main/deck.csv
")

Can you please suggest how I can able to resolve this issue?

Yes. Many experienced R programmers do not use Roxygen
(or use it only rarely; e.g., together with ESS (Emacs Speaks
 Statistics) to make the initial creation or sometime a thorough
 updating the help pages  man/*.Rd more convenient).

There are different tastes and different work flows for
different people.

Me neither.  A new option, not changing the default, would make sense.

Hello,

You can define a vector of the columns of interest and subset the data 
with it. Then the default na.action = na.omit will no longer remove the 
rows with NA vals in at least one column and the results are the same.

However, this will not give the mean values of the other numeric 
columns, just of those two.



# define a vector of columns of interest
cols <- c("Length", "Width", "RAWMAT")

# 1) Simple aggregation with 2 variables, select cols:
aggregate(cbind(Length, Width) ~ RAWMAT, data = my_data[cols], FUN = 
mean, na.rm = TRUE)

# 2) Using the dot notation - if cols are selected, equal results:
aggregate(. ~ RAWMAT, data = my_data[cols], FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)

# 3) Using dplyr, the results are now the same results as #1 and #2:
my_data %>%
   select(all_of(cols)) %>%
   group_by(RAWMAT) %>%
   summarise(across(c("Length", "Width"), ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)))


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Thanks Rui for your help; that would be one possibility indeed.

But am I the only one who finds that behavior of aggregate() completely 
unexpected and confusing? Especially considering that dplyr::summarise() 
and doBy::summaryBy() deal with NAs differently, even though they all 
use mean(na.rm = TRUE) to calculate the group stats.

Best wishes,
Ivan

Hello,

Puzzling at first yes, unexpected no, it's documented behavior.

This is the result of how the aggregate works, by first applying 
na.action to the data and only then applying the function to each column 
in the formula's LHS.

dplyr works column by column, so there is no na.action involved.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Dear Ivan,

Yes, I would be up for trying, but this week I need to finish some stuff before going on holidays.
I will try compiling R from source when I am back from holidays, and ask you if I need assistance.

Many thanks again for trying to solve this issue.

Best regards,
Christophe

Haha, got it now, there is an na.action argument (which defaults to 
na.omit) to aggregate() which is applied before calling mean(na.rm = 
TRUE). Thank you Rui for pointing this out.

So running it with na.pass instead of na.omit gives the same results as 
dplyr::group_by()+summarise():
aggregate(. ~ RAWMAT, data = my_data[-1], FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE, 
na.action = na.pass)

Cheers,
Ivan

Subject: [R] Finding combination of states
Message-ID: <CA+dpOJk6kzWbPa7zba_51yMFLpeyXYzWWkYY-63-r5Y50C1mzw@mail.gmail.com>

Let say I have 3 time points.as T0, T1, and T2.(number of such time
points can be arbitrary) In each time point, an object can be any of 5
states, A, B, C, D, E (number of such states can be arbitrary)

I need to find all possible ways, how that object starting with state
B (say) at time T0, can be on state E (example) in time T2

For example one possibility is BAE etc.

Is there any function available with R, that can give me a vector of
such possibilities for arbitrary number of states, time, and for a
given initial and final (desired) states?

ANy pointer will be very appreciated.

Thanks for your time.

Yes: You used the wrong "file name", because you added a
     <newline> / <linebreak> 
     on both ends by breaking the line.

This works nicely:

Thank you very much for all the responses; especially Duncan's guidance. 
I will add some further ideas on workflows below.

There were quite a few views on GitHub; but there is not much to see, as 
there is absolutely no documentation.? I have added in the meantime a 
basic example:
https://github.com/discoleo/BioShapes/blob/main/Examples.Bioshapes.png
The actual code can do a lot more.

############

Some ideas on workflows:

1. Most code is written as C/C++; the R code is a thin wrapper around 
the C/C++ functions
It is practical to embed the documentation with the R code - as there is 
no complex code anyway. The same may apply for small packages.

2. Complex R code
The comments may clutter the code. It is also difficult to maintain this 
documentation, as the comments are less easily readable. Separating the 
documentation from the code is a good idea.

Unfortunately, this is not so obvious when you start working on your 
first package.

Many thanks,

Leonard

The function purrr::cross() can help you with this. For example:

f <- function(states, nsteps, first, last) {
   paste(first, unlist(lapply(purrr::cross(rep(list(v),nsteps-2)),
\(x) paste(unlist(x), collapse=""))), last, sep="")
}
f(LETTERS[1:5], 3, "B", "E")
[1] "BAE" "BBE" "BCE" "BDE" "BEE"

Ivan:
Just one perhaps extraneous comment.

You said that you were surprised that aggregate() and group_by() did not
have the same behavior. That is a misconception on your part. As you know,
the tidyverse recapitulates the functionality of many base R functions; but
it makes no claims to do so in exactly the same way and, indeed, often
makes deliberate changes to "improve" behavior. So if you wish to use both,
you should *expect* such differences, which, of course, are documented in
the man pages (and often elsewhere).

Cheers,
Bert

Make sure to compile with DEBUG=1 so that the compiler flags needed to

The function purrr::cross() can help you with this. For example:

f <- function(states, nsteps, first, last) {
   paste(first, unlist(lapply(purrr::cross(rep(list(v),nsteps-2)),
\(x) paste(unlist(x), collapse=""))), last, sep="") } f(LETTERS[1:5], 3, "B", "E") [1] "BAE" "BBE" "BCE" "BDE" "BEE"

I think there may be some uncertainty here about what the OP requested. My
interpretation is:

n different times
k different states
Any state can appear at any time in the vector of times and can be repeated
Initial and final states are given

So modifying Tim's expand.grid() solution a bit yields:

g <- function(ntimes, states, init, final){
   ## ntimes: integer, number of unique times
   ## states: vector of unique states
   ## init: initial state
   ## final: final state
do.call(paste0,c(init,expand.grid(rep(list(states), ntimes-2)), final))
}

e.g.

> g(4, LETTERS[1:5], "B", "D")
 [1] "BAAD" "BBAD" "BCAD" "BDAD" "BEAD" "BABD" "BBBD" "BCBD"
 [9] "BDBD" "BEBD" "BACD" "BBCD" "BCCD" "BDCD" "BECD" "BADD"
[17] "BBDD" "BCDD" "BDDD" "BEDD" "BAED" "BBED" "BCED" "BDED"
[25] "BEED"

If neither this nor any of the other suggestions is not what is desired, I
think the OP will have to clarify his query.

Cheers,
Bert

My initial response was buggy and also used a deprecated function.
Also, it seems possible that one may want to rule out any strings where the
same state appears consecutively.
I say that such a string has a repeat.

myExpand <- function(v, n) {
  do.call(tidyr::expand_grid, replicate(n, v, simplify = FALSE))
}

no_repeat <- function(s) {
  v <- unlist(strsplit(s, NULL))
  sum(v[-1]==v[-length(v)]) == 0
}

f <- function(states, nsteps, first, last, rm_repeat=TRUE) {
  if (nsteps < 3) stop("nsteps must be at least 3")
    out <- paste(first,
          myExpand(states, nsteps-2) |>
            apply(MAR=1, \(x) paste(x, collapse="")),
          last, sep="")
    if (rm_repeat) {
      ok <- sapply(out, no_repeat)
      out <- out[ok]
    }
    out
}

f(LETTERS[1:5],4,"B","E")

#  [1] "BABE" "BACE" "BADE" "BCAE" "BCBE" "BCDE" "BDAE" "BDBE" "BDCE"
"BEAE" "BEBE" "BECE" "BEDE"

Well, if strings with repeats (as you defined them) are to be excluded, I
think it's simple just to use regular expressions to remove them.

e.g.
g <- function(ntimes, states, init, final, repeats = TRUE)
   ## ntimes: integer, number of unique times
   ## states: vector of unique states
   ## init: initial state
   ## final: final state
{
out <- do.call(paste0,c(init,expand.grid(rep(list(states), ntimes-2)),
final))
if(!repeats)
   out[-grep(paste(paste0(states,states),  collapse = "|"),out)]
else out
}
So:

> g(4, LETTERS[1:5], "B", "E", repeats = FALSE)
 [1] "BCAE" "BDAE" "BEAE" "BABE" "BCBE" "BDBE" "BEBE" "BACE"
 [9] "BDCE" "BECE" "BADE" "BCDE" "BEDE"

Perhaps not the most efficient way to do this, of course.

Cheers,
Bert

I agree with Rui that this behaves as documented but I also agree with 
Ivan that the behavior is potentially confusing. Not so much because other 
packages behave differently but mostly because the handling of missing 
values differs between the different aggregate() methods.

Based on my teaching experience, I feel that a default of 
na.action=na.pass would be less confusing, especially in the case with 
multivariate "response".

In the univeriate case the discrepancy can be surprising - in the default 
method you need na.rm=TRUE but in the formula method you get the same 
result without additional arguments (due to na.action=na.omit). But in the 
multivariate case the discrepancy is not obvious, especially for 
beginners, because the results in other variables without NAs are affected 
as well.

A minimal toy example is the following data with two groups (x = A vs. B) 
and two "responses" (y without NAs and z with NA):

d <- data.frame(x = c("A", "A", "B", "B"), y = 1:4, z = c(1:3, NA))
d
##   x y  z
## 1 A 1  1
## 2 A 2  2
## 3 B 3  3
## 4 B 4 NA

Except for naming of the columns, both of the following summaries for y by 
x (without NAs) yield the same result:

aggregate(d$y, list(d$x), FUN = mean)
aggregate(y ~ x, data = d, FUN = mean)
##   x   y
## 1 A 1.5
## 2 B 3.5

For a single variable _with_ NAs, the default method needs the na.rm = 
TRUE argument, the fomula method does not. Again, except for naming of the 
columns:

aggregate(d$z, list(d$x), FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
aggregate(z ~ x, data = d, FUN = mean)
##   x   z
## 1 A 1.5
## 2 B 3.0

Conversely, if you do want the NAs in the groups, the following two are 
the same (except for naming):

aggregate(d$z, list(d$x), FUN = mean)
aggregate(z ~ x, data = d, FUN = mean, na.action = na.pass)
##   x   z
## 1 A 1.5
## 2 B  NA

But in the multivariate case, it is not so obvious why the following two 
commands differ in their results for y (!), the variable without NAs, in 
group B:

aggregate(d[, c("y", "z")], list(d$x), FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
##   Group.1   y   z
## 1       A 1.5 1.5
## 2       B 3.5 3.0
              ^^^

aggregate(cbind(y, z) ~ x, data = d, FUN = mean)
##   x   y   z
## 1 A 1.5 1.5
## 2 B 3.0 3.0
        ^^^

Hence, in my programming courses I tell students to use na.action=na.pass 
in the formula method and to handle NAs in the FUN argument themselves.

I guess that this is not important enough to change the default in 
aggregate.formula. Or are there R core members who also find that this 
inconsistency between the different methods is worth addressing?

If not, maybe an explicit example could be added on the help page? Showing 
something like this might help:

## default: omit enitre row 4 where z=NA
aggregate(cbind(y, z) ~ x, data = d, FUN = mean)
##   x   y   z
## 1 A 1.5 1.5
## 2 B 3.0 3.0

## alternatively: omit row 4 only for z result but not for y result
aggregate(cbind(y, z) ~ x, data = d, FUN = mean, na.action = na.pass, na.rm = TRUE)
##   x   y   z
## 1 A 1.5 1.5
## 2 B 3.5 3.0

Best wishes,
Achim

... and just for fun, here is a non-string version (more appropriate for
complex state labels??):

gvec <- function(ntimes, states, init, final, repeats = TRUE)
   ## ntimes: integer, number of unique times
   ## states: vector of unique states
   ## init: initial state
   ## final: final state
{
   out <- cbind(init,
            as.matrix(expand.grid(rep(list(states),ntimes -2 ))),final)
   if(!repeats)
     out[ apply(out,1,\(x)all(x[-1] != x[-ntimes])), ]
   else out
}

yielding:

      init Var1 Var2 final

Subject: [R] Error in analysis of arguments of Rasch
Message-ID: <CAEU20u1KT1Ts0fvL0VEAUtnnZmxc3=1PWviiTgq8P06KLqip+w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

I am using ltm and eRm package in analysing my polytomous data for fitting
item response theory and Rasch model, respectively.

I'm having a problem with the error as below;

> library(eRm)
> library(ltm)
> HT <- read.csv("C:/Dropbox/Analysis R_2023/HT.csv")
> response_columns <- HT[, 1:ncol(HT)]
> response_matrix <- as.matrix(response_columns)
> irt_model <- grm(response_matrix)
> rasch_model <- Rasch(response_matrix)
Error in Rasch(response_matrix) : could not find function "Rasch"

Then I changed the arguments of Rasch to RM, but it also turns out an error
as below;

> rasch_model <- RM(response_matrix)
Error in datcheck(X, W, mpoints, groupvec, model) :
  Dichotomous data matrix required!

Is there any problem with the arguments or any other problem with my coding
since errors keep occurring when I want to run Rasch.

Thank you very much for any help given.

Azi.

Hi Bert,
I really liked your solution.
In the spirit of code golf, I wondered if there is a shorter way to do
the regular expression test.
Kudos to my coding buddy GPT-4 for the following:

You can replace your statement

out[-grep(paste(paste0(states,states),  collapse = "|"),out)]

by

out[-grep("(.)\\1",out)]

Best,
Eric

Hi all,

I have these data

x1 <- c(116,0,115,137,127,0,0)
x2 <- c(0,159,0,0,0,159,127)

I want : xx <- c(116,115,137,127,159, 127)

I would like to merge these data into one column. Whenever the data is '0'
it will be replaced by the value in the column which is non zero..
I tried append and merge but fail to get what I want.

Hello,

That's a case for ?pmax:


x1 <- c(116,0,115,137,127,0,0)
x2 <- c(0,159,0,0,0,159,127)
pmax(x1, x2)
#> [1] 116 159 115 137 127 159 127


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Others have pointed out pmax(x1, x2).  For the sample data, even x1+x2 
would give the same answer.

The real question is what you want to do if both x1 and x2 have non-zero 
entries, or negative entries:

   pmax(x1, x2)

will pick the larger one.  It might be zero if the other is negative, 
and that doesn't match your description.

   x1+x2

will just give the sum, which doesn't match your description if both are 
non-zero.

But maybe you want the x1 value unless it is zero, even if it is smaller 
than the x2 value:  then you would use

   ifelse(x1 != 0, x1, x2)

Similarly

   ifelse(x2 != 0, x2, x1)

would prefer the x2 value.

You should think about what you would do in these other cases as well.

Oh I liked that.

I was actually thinking about something similar, but couldn't figure it
out.  The idiom you showed is very clever imo and taught me something about
regexes that I never properly understood.

As Duncan points out, ifelse() provides a more general approach than
the specific pmax().

Even more generally, you might want to consider the apply() function
(and its relatives sapply(), lapply(), ...)

For example

apply(cbind(x1,x2), MAR=1, max)

In the above statement, x1 and x2 are combined into two columns, MAR=1
says apply the following function to each row,
and max specifies the function to be applied. The summary is that this
statement applies the max to each row in the object
specified by the first argument. It's very general because you can
replace max by an arbitrary function.

Similarly, if you get more into R you might modify the above using
chained operations. The following rewrites the above
by piping cbind(x1,x2) into the apply command. Not a necessary feature
to know but eventually will assist you in writing code that does
not require a lot of intermediate variables.

cbind(x1,x2) |> apply(MAR=1,max)

Hi,

I am Sukriti Sood, a research analyst at Woodstock Institute <https://woodstockinst.org/> . I use RStudio extensively for our analysis. I have been facing two issues for a while:


  1.  I am unable to copy from RStudio and paste into or vice versa to any other programs.
  2.  I am facing some kind of a conversion error (screenshot attached).

I tried looking up online however could not find a resolution to these issues. Could I please get some help with this urgently.

Thanks!

Best,
Sukriti Sood

R is not RStudio. RStudio is not R.

RStudio helps you work with R, but to do so it "types" in some commands behind the scenes. I suspect those errors are because you have a pairing of versions of RStudio with a version of R that the RStudio team did not test.

Someone here might be able to help, but the most likely way to encounter someone who knows what bugs RStudio has is to ask in the RStudio support area [1].

Hello,

You should post RStudio questions to the RStudio support service, they 
answer quickly and the answers are generally good.

It's written at the bottom of the attached image that the workspace was 
loaded from file


C:/WSI/.RData


Close RStudio, remove this file and restart. See if it solved it.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Sounds like something weird happened to your installation of the knitr package. It could help to reinstall it. If you don't have anything valuable saved in %userprofile%\.RData, it may be worth moving it away, because it may be carrying a part of the broken state. (Saving state in .RData may be convenient, but it may hurt the reproducibility of your scripts and persist some of your problems.)

Knitr lives separately from R and RStudio in a "library", most likely under your %userprofile%. Try using install.packages to install it anew.

Can you load knitr from an RGui session? If yes, the problem might be elsewhere.

Subject: [R] How to draw plot marks without label?
Message-ID: <CAMk+s2Q2KAuh5gtkQ54q7NiY4rdLACu1XfjdFd0iV2TVNC-XCQ@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to draw a graph where the y-lables are missing but the
marks still present.
In this example, I get marks from 20000 to 140 000 with increments of
20 000. I could use `plot(... yaxt="n"...)` combined with `axis(2,
at..., label="")` but this needs to know exactly the sequence of marks
provided by plot. But this sequence might change.

Thus is there a way to plot the marks without labels?
Also, is it possible to draw the marks on the right side?

Thank you.

```
y = c(42008, 19076, 150576, 48192, 26153, 37931, 36103, 17692,
      61538,41027, 71052, 94571)
df = data.frame(X = c(rep(0, 6), rep(25, 6)), Y = y)
stripchart(df$Y ~ df$X,
           method = "jitter", offset=1/3,
           vertical = TRUE, las=1,
           pch=16, cex=2,
           ylab="Y", xlab="X",
           main="Example")
```

Hi

Do you mean like this ... ?


stripchart(df$Y ~ df$X,
            method = "jitter", offset=1/3,
            vertical = TRUE, las=1,
            pch=16, cex=2,
            ylab="Y", xlab="X",
            main="Example",
            axes=FALSE)
box()
axis(1)
axis(2, labels=FALSE)
axis(4, labels=FALSE)

Luigi:

For base R graphics, you should always consult ?par for optional graphical
parameters when the high level graphics function doesn't appear to provide
the control you would like. I don't use base graphics -- i.e. i"m not
particularly facile with it -- but as you provided an example, I decided to
try to help. I think this is what you may want:

stripchart(
           Y ~ X, data = df,  ## better way to specify data  instead of $
           method = "jitter", offset=1/3,
           vertical = TRUE, las=1,
           pch=16, cex=2,
           ylab="Y", xlab="X",
           yaxt= "n",  ## don't plot y axes
           main="Example")

## Now add y axis on right with default tick mark locations
axis(side = 4, labels = FALSE)

How I got this (you may find this useful to modify the above if I didn't
get what you wanted) was as follows:

stripchart() does not seem to allow the direct control over the axes you
want. The 'axes' parameter help in ?stripchart sent me to?par to see if I
could specify an axis on the right instead of on the left, but it did not
seem to provide such an option. So I decided to use what the yaxt parameter
described to omit the y axis in the high level (stripchart) call, and then
add it back with a subsequent call to axis(). I just used default tick
locations in that call, but you can specify them explicitly as ?axis
describes

Again, if this is not what you wanted, I hope you can use the above to
modify stripchart() to your desired specification.

Cheers,
Bert

Thank you that is exactly it.
I know these are basic questions but I can't find the solution on
either manuals or online...

Dear Sukriti.

Hmm, the R-help list is really about R, and *not* RStudio.
There are RStudio community places to ask for help with the IDE,
"RStudio Desktop" I think it is called now.

Also screenshots of R console output are really not intended for
this mailing list.  Please rather send *text* to here which you
cut'n'paste (and possible re-format / clean)  from the R console.

Still taking the extra effort and deciphering your screenshot,
I see that you are using R version 4.3.1 for Windows .. which is
fine... then an  iconv() conversion error and an other error
message that "knitr" was not found; finally

[Workspace loaded from C:/WSI/.RData]

Please rename this file, C:/WSI/.RData , to something else
(do this with the file browser from Windows; outside R).

If that does not help, try to start R outside of RStudio,
and report here (*not* by a screenshot) if you still get an
error.
If you get to the R prompt at all please also send the console
output from (typing in the R console)
  > sessionInfo()

If  R  works fine outside RStudio,  you definitely need to get
help from the RStudio community.
Hoping that helps some steps further.

Best regards,
Martin

Subject: [R] confidence interval around Aalen-Johansen if no events
Message-ID: <87il8nfwg4.fsf@med.uni-goettingen.de>

Hi all,

I'd like to calculate confidence intervals around Aalen-Johansen
estimates at given time points.  And later I'd like to be able to
compare the Aalen-Johansen estimates at given time points between
groups.
My problem is, that there are no events recorded.

So my question is:
Does anyone know how to get confidence intervals around Aalen-Johansen
estimates in the absence of (or prior to) events?
(And ideally also how to compare the Aalen-Johansen estimates at given
time points between groups in that situation.)

Note that I can do the same thing for Kaplan-Meier estimates (using
the bpcp package).

Many thanks in advance!

Best,
Andreas

PS:  Some code that illustrates my problem:

library("dplyr")
library("survival")

Hi Ivan,

Actually, by getting an answer on another issue concerning updates of Git for Windows, I managed to solve this issue for me.
As can be seen here (https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/4591), both issues were related to a mispecification of my ComSpec environment variable. Its value should be a single path to the cmd.exe file and no semi-columns neither.
With this done, I could also install again R packages from source. However, I am not sure how I ended up messing up this ComSpec variable in the first place :-/
But now it seems to be fixed.

Best regards,
Christophe

Congratulations on solving this yourself! It turns out that the
system() function itself doesn't work properly when %COMSPEC% isn't set
right. It may have taken a long time to find.

I'm a little confused, because the sample code does something that
none of the suggestions does.
x1 <- c(116,0,115,137,127,0,0)
x2 <- c(0,159,0,0,0,159,127)

[You] want : xx <- c(116,115,137,127,159, 127)
Assuming that there should have been two copies of 159 in xx, this is
xx <- c(x1[x1 != 0], x2[x2 != 0])
pmax or ifelse would give you
xx <- c(116,159,115,137,127,159,127)  # NOT the desired result

If there really was supposed to be one copy of 159,
you might want to call unique() somewhere.

You really need to set out clearly and unambiguously what
you actually want.

The Data Colada blog has some articles about the groundhog package.
See particular https://datacolada.org/95
and especially https://datacolada.org/100

I now have three reasons for preferring to stick with the core library
packages as much as possible.
1) It's just better style to do more with less.
2) The core packages are much better documented.  I'm favourably
   impressed by R package documentation in general, but the core
   packages are spelled out in more detail in more books.  (Only
   the tidyverse comes close, and it doesn't come close.)
3) Packages outside the core break frighteningly fast.
   From Data Colada 100,
   "A paper published ... in *Nature: Scientific Data (.htm
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01143-6>)* attempted to
automatically re-execute 2335 R scripts posted as supporting materials for
published papers. After cleaning the scripts (installing necessary packages
and fixing paths to local files) only  44% of scripts run without
generating errors. So, *most* scripts did not run."

Now the issue here is strikingly reminiscent of expand.grid.
In fact it's so reminiscent of expand.grid that I wonder if expand.grid
could be used to solve whatever the *original* problem was.

paste2 <- function (x, y) as.vector(outer(x, y, paste(0))
states <- list(c("X"), c("A","B","C"), c("A","B","C"), c("A","B","C"),
c("Z"))
x <- states[[length(states)]]
for (i in (length(states)-1):1) x <- paste2(states[[i]], x)
x

The output is
 [1] "XAAAZ" "XBAAZ" "XCAAZ" "XABAZ" "XBBAZ" "XCBAZ" "XACAZ" "XBCAZ"
"XCCAZ"}
[10] "XAABZ" "XBABZ" "XCABZ" "XABBZ" "XBBBZ" "XCBBZ" "XACBZ" "XBCBZ" "XCCBZ"
[19] "XAACZ" "XBACZ" "XCACZ" "XABCZ" "XBBCZ" "XCBCZ" "XACCZ" "XBCCZ" "XCCCZ"

How close this comes to what you want is for you to decide;
what I've hoped to show is that core R has simple building blocks
that you can use *simply* to do this kind of thing.

In fact we can do better by eliminating outer() and using rep() to
reshape the state lists and a single invocation of paste0() to put
them together.  But it's probably not worth while.

Subject: [R] Error in finding factor scores/ person ability in item response
 theory
Message-ID: <CAEU20u0tNZDnucPE9TJwcMoNR1LQ=D6La91-Aq8UiTvO=oazxA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

I have encountered some error in finding factor scores/ person ability in
item response theory.
I tried a few times using ltm and mirt package but it still gave me error.

#TRY #1 - Fit GPCM model using ltm



> irt_model <- gpcm(response_matrix)

> irt_person_abilities <- fscores(irt_model)

*Error in object at Model : *

*  no applicable method for `@` applied to an object of class "gpcm"*





#TRY #2 - Fit  GPCM model using ltm



> irt_model <- gpcm(data = HT, constraint = "1PL")

> irt_person_abilities <- factor.scores(irt_model)

*Error in factor.scores(irt_model) : *

*  argument "f" is missing, with no default*





#TRY #3 - Fit GPCM model using mirt



> irt_model <- mirt(data = HT, model = "gpcm", itemtype = "graded")

*Error in model$x[i, "Type"] : subscript out of bounds*

*In addition: Warning message:*

*In cbind(model$x, OptionalGroups = "") :*

*  number of rows of result is not a multiple of vector length (arg 2)*

> irt_person_abilities_dim1 <- fscores(gpcm_model, method = "EAP", dims = 1)

*Error in object at Model : *

*  no applicable method for `@` applied to an object of class "gpcm"*


I am not sure which package is suitable with my data (Polytomous - Partial
Credit Model) and why it always turns out to be an error.

Thank you very much for any help given.

Azila.

I like many packages. They give me working code that it would take a long time for me to write (and debug). In some cases I am fairly sure that the effort would be a full time job on top of my regular workload. The packages use less of my time.

I hate packages because of Richard's point #3. I have SAS code written in 1986 that still works without any modification or updating. R code may not work as of the next update unless all of the packages are also updated. The more packages I use, the more often I must fight with one or more of them to keep my code running. If the code is something I want to keep for a long time, then it pays in the long run to use the fewest packages possible.

Subject: Re: [R] Finding combination of states

[External Email]

The Data Colada blog has some articles about the groundhog package.
See particular https://datacolada.org/95
and especially https://datacolada.org/100

I now have three reasons for preferring to stick with the core library packages as much as possible.
1) It's just better style to do more with less.
2) The core packages are much better documented.  I'm favourably
   impressed by R package documentation in general, but the core
   packages are spelled out in more detail in more books.  (Only
   the tidyverse comes close, and it doesn't come close.)
3) Packages outside the core break frighteningly fast.
   From Data Colada 100,
   "A paper published ... in *Nature: Scientific Data (.htm
<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01143-6>)* attempted to automatically re-execute 2335 R scripts posted as supporting materials for published papers. After cleaning the scripts (installing necessary packages and fixing paths to local files) only  44% of scripts run without generating errors. So, *most* scripts did not run."

Now the issue here is strikingly reminiscent of expand.grid.
In fact it's so reminiscent of expand.grid that I wonder if expand.grid could be used to solve whatever the *original* problem was.

paste2 <- function (x, y) as.vector(outer(x, y, paste(0)) states <- list(c("X"), c("A","B","C"), c("A","B","C"), c("A","B","C"),
c("Z"))
x <- states[[length(states)]]
for (i in (length(states)-1):1) x <- paste2(states[[i]], x) x

The output is
 [1] "XAAAZ" "XBAAZ" "XCAAZ" "XABAZ" "XBBAZ" "XCBAZ" "XACAZ" "XBCAZ"
"XCCAZ"}
[10] "XAABZ" "XBABZ" "XCABZ" "XABBZ" "XBBBZ" "XCBBZ" "XACBZ" "XBCBZ" "XCCBZ"
[19] "XAACZ" "XBACZ" "XCACZ" "XABCZ" "XBBCZ" "XCBCZ" "XACCZ" "XBCCZ" "XCCCZ"

How close this comes to what you want is for you to decide; what I've hoped to show is that core R has simple building blocks that you can use *simply* to do this kind of thing.

In fact we can do better by eliminating outer() and using rep() to reshape the state lists and a single invocation of paste0() to put them together.  But it's probably not worth while.

The example is the example in the documentation for the method. There were no details. https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/prop.trend.test
More documentation would be useful. Answering questions like what are these numbers?

As shown, I see a cluster of three values in the 70-90 and an outlier at 129. The pattern repeats for patients, with very slightly different numbers. Is the outlier real or a data error? Are these values real or just some values stuffed into an example to show that I can get numbers back out?

Hello,

By visual inspection it seems that there is a decreasing trend.
Note that the sample estimates of prop.test and smokers/patients are equal.


smokers  <- c( 83, 90, 129, 70 )
patients <- c( 86, 93, 136, 82 )

prop.test(smokers, patients)$estimate
#>    prop 1    prop 2    prop 3    prop 4
#> 0.9651163 0.9677419 0.9485294 0.8536585
smokers/patients
#> [1] 0.9651163 0.9677419 0.9485294 0.8536585

plot(smokers/patients, type = "b")



Hope this helps,

Colleagues,

Thanks all for the responses. 

I am monitoring the daily total number of defects per sample unit. 
I need to know whether this daily defect proportion is trending upward (a bad thing for a manufacturing process).

My first thought was to use either a u or a u' control chart for this.
As far as I know, u or u' charts are poor to detect drifts. 

This is why I chose to use prop.trend.test to detect trends in proportions.

While prop.trend.test can confirm the existence of a trend, as far as I know, it is left to the user
to determine what direction that trend is. 

One way to illustrate trending is of course to plot the data and use geom_smooth and method lm
For the non-statisticians in my group, I've found that using this method along with the p-value of prop.trend.test, makes it easier for the users to determine the existence of trending and its direction.

If there are any other ways to do this, please let me know.

Thomas Subia

You might want to consider exponential smoothing models such as Holt's
(Double Exponential Smoothing).
This method continually updates the trend parameter, and you can
monitor the most recent value (for sign, or magnitude, or both).

In R, some choices to fit the Holt model:

1. stats::HoltWinters() and set the gamma argument to FALSE for a
non-seasonal model
2. forecast::holt()

HTH,
Eric

Yes, this was written a bit bone-headed (as I am allowed to say...)

If you look at the code, you will see inside:

    a <- anova(lm(freq ~ score, data = list(freq = x/n, score = as.vector(score)), 
        weights = w))

and the lm() inside should give you the direction via the sign of the regression coefficient on "score".
 
So, at least for now, you could just doctor a copy of the code for your own purposes, as in

 fit <- lm(freq ~ score, data = list(freq = x/n, score = as.vector(score)), 
        weights = w)
 a <- anova(fit)
 
and arrange to return coef(fit)["score"] at the end. Something like structure(... estimate=c(lpm.slope=coef(fit)["score"]) ....)

(I expect that you might also extract the t-statistic from coef(summary(fit)) and find that it is the signed square root of the Chi-square, but I won't have time to test that just now.)

Hello,

Actually, the t-statistic is not the signed square root of the X-squared 
test statistic. I have edited the function, assigned the lm fit and 
returned it as is. (print.htest won't print this new list member so the 
output is not cluttered with irrelevant noise.)


smokers  <- c( 83, 90, 129, 70 )
patients <- c( 86, 93, 136, 82 )

edit(prop.trend.test, file = "ptt.R")
source("ptt.R")

# stats::prop.trend.test edited to include the results
# of the lm fit and saved under a new name
ptt <- function (x, n, score = seq_along(x))
{
   method <- "Chi-squared Test for Trend in Proportions"
   dname <- paste(deparse1(substitute(x)), "out of", 
deparse1(substitute(n)),
                  ",\n using scores:", paste(score, collapse = " "))
   x <- as.vector(x)
   n <- as.vector(n)
   p <- sum(x)/sum(n)
   w <- n/p/(1 - p)
   a <- anova(fit <- lm(freq ~ score, data = list(freq = x/n, score = 
as.vector(score)),
                        weights = w))
   chisq <- c(`X-squared` = a["score", "Sum Sq"])
   structure(list(statistic = chisq, parameter = c(df = 1),
                  p.value = pchisq(as.numeric(chisq), 1, lower.tail = 
FALSE),
                  method = method, data.name = dname
                  , lmfit = fit
                  ), class = "htest")
}


ht <- ptt(smokers, patients)

Say I have one machine that produces 15 million widgets per day. Every day a few widgets are defective. Is the proportion increasing?
The data analyst needs to know what time span is of interest. I assume that there is some day-to-day variability. Is today's defect rate greater or less than yesterday's rate is not a trend. However, there might also be other trends. 4th shift might have a higher rate than 2nd shift, or within a shift the rate may change as workers tire or get breaks.

I might try the PooledInfRate package. It calculates a proportion defective and a 95% confidence interval. Do the intervals overlap?
I might  try being selective. If the rate changes over the week, then the weekly cycle may obscure an underlying trend. For the last year, has the rate increased using only data from Monday?
The question gets more complicated if there are multiple production lines and locations. High worker turnover may also be an issue.

Hello,

Actually, the t-statistic is not the signed square root of the X-squared test statistic. I have edited the function, assigned the lm fit and returned it as is. (print.htest won't print this new list member so the output is not cluttered with irrelevant noise.)


smokers  <- c( 83, 90, 129, 70 )
patients <- c( 86, 93, 136, 82 )

edit(prop.trend.test, file = "ptt.R")
source("ptt.R")

# stats::prop.trend.test edited to include the results # of the lm fit and saved under a new name ptt <- function (x, n, score = seq_along(x)) {
   method <- "Chi-squared Test for Trend in Proportions"
   dname <- paste(deparse1(substitute(x)), "out of", deparse1(substitute(n)),
                  ",\n using scores:", paste(score, collapse = " "))
   x <- as.vector(x)
   n <- as.vector(n)
   p <- sum(x)/sum(n)
   w <- n/p/(1 - p)
   a <- anova(fit <- lm(freq ~ score, data = list(freq = x/n, score = as.vector(score)),
                        weights = w))
   chisq <- c(`X-squared` = a["score", "Sum Sq"])
   structure(list(statistic = chisq, parameter = c(df = 1),
                  p.value = pchisq(as.numeric(chisq), 1, lower.tail = FALSE),
                  method = method, data.name = dname
                  , lmfit = fit
                  ), class = "htest")
}


ht <- ptt(smokers, patients)
ht$statistic |> sqrt()
#> X-squared

Subject: [R] how to get paste() to output \% so LaTeX will interpret it as a
 percent sign rather than a comment symbol
Message-ID: <CAM+rpYnF_66Cs9t5AKRJ-6DzTY8BsM3ytVuAsJrzfLJm6UFsWQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm using a .Rnw --> Sweave --> pdflatex workflow on Windows 10, with emacs
26.3 and ESS (not sure which version.)

I have this code:

n.tests.7 <- 3 ## for example
trailing.7.pos.percent <- 12  ## for example
trailing.7.message <-
    ifelse( n.tests.7 > 0,
            paste("In the past seven days,", n.tests.7, "test results have
been reported, of which", trailing.7.pos.percent, "\\% were positive"),
            paste("No test results have been reported from these labs in
the past seven days.") )

Desired outcome in the resulting .tex file is "In the past seven days, 3
test results have been reported, of which 12\% were positive."

But I get "In the past seven days, 3 test results have been reported, of
which 12\\% were positive." Which, when compiled in pdflatex,
unsurprisingly cuts off the sentence at 12

Replacing, in the .Rnw code, the \\% with \% , yields an R error message:

Error: '\%' is an unrecognized escape in character string starting ""\%"

Grateful for any help.

You're getting confused between the contents of the string and the
printed representation of the string. There's a little bit about this
in R4DS: https://r4ds.hadley.nz/strings#escapes

(or in brief, do writeLines(trailing.7.message))

In my AWS Sagemaker account latticeExtra does not load.  It has worked in the past.

How can this problem be fixed?

Thanks,

Sounds like an LD_LIBRARY_PATH problem. How did you install the jpeg package? Try reinstalling it.

Can you supply us with some sample data?

 A handy way to supply some sample data is the dput() function.  In the
case of a large dataset something like dput(head(mydata, 100)) should
supply the data we need. Just do dput(mydata) where *mydata* is your data.
Copy the output and paste it here.

Reinstall of jpeg followed by reinstall of latticeExtra solved this problem.

Argh, yes, drats, thanks. 

There will be a matter of an estimated residual error.

So

> coef(summary(ht$lmfit))["score","t value"]*sigma(ht$lmfit)
[1] -2.867913

matches the signes square root of the Chi-square.

Or, likely better (avoid 0 df cases), switch to a Gaussian glm fit and use the z stat

> coef(summary(ht$glmfit, dispersion = 1))
               Estimate Std. Error   z value      Pr(>|z|)
(Intercept)  1.02187141 0.03199737 31.936102 8.425506e-224
score       -0.03341563 0.01165155 -2.867913  4.131897e-03

The Estimate (-0.0334) should still make sense as the LPM estimate of the regression slope.

Hello,

I'm trying to calculate the mean temperature max from a file of climate
date, and plot it over a range of days in the year. I've downloaded the
data, and cleaned it up the way I think it should be. However, when I
plot it, the geom_smooth line doesn't show up. I think that's because
my x axis is characters or factors. Here's what I have so far:
========================================
library(tidyverse)

data <- read_csv("Ely_MN_Weather.csv")

start_day = yday(as_date("2023-09-22"))
end_day = yday(as_date("2023-10-15"))
               
d <- as_tibble(data) %>%
    select(DATE,TMAX,TMIN) %>%
    mutate(DATE = as_date(DATE),
           yday = yday(DATE),
           md = sprintf("%02d-%02d", month(DATE), mday(DATE))
           ) %>%
    filter(yday >= start_day & yday <= end_day) %>%
    mutate(md = as.factor(md))

d_sum <- d %>%
    group_by(md) %>%
    summarize(tmax_mean = mean(TMAX, na.rm=TRUE))

## Here's the filtered data:
dput(d_sum)

> structure(list(md = structure(1:25, levels = c("09-21", "09-22", 
"09-23", "09-24", "09-25", "09-26", "09-27", "09-28", "09-29",

    geom_point(aes(y = tmax_mean, color = "blue")) +
    geom_smooth(aes(y = tmax_mean, color = "blue"))
=====================================
My questions are:
1. Why isn't my geom_smooth plotting? How can I fix it?
2. I don't think I'm handling the month and day combination correctly.
Is there a way to encode month and day (but not year) as a date?
3. (Minor point) Why does my graph of tmax_mean come out red when I
specify "blue"?

Thanks for any advice or guidance you can offer. I really appreciate
the expertise of this group.

Hello,

There are no attached graphs, only data.
Can you post the code have you tried?

Hope this helps,

Hello,

The problem is that the dates are factors, not real dates. And 
geom_smooth is not interpolating along a discrete axis (the x axis).

Paste a fake year with md, coerce to date and plot.
I have simplified the aes() calls and added a date scale in order to 
make the x axis more readable.

Without the formula and method arguments, geom_smooth will print a 
message, they are now made explicit.



suppressPackageStartupMessages({
   library(dplyr)
   library(ggplot2)
})

d_sum %>%
   mutate(md = paste("2023", md, sep = "-"),
          md = as.Date(md)) %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = md, y = tmax_mean)) +
   geom_point(color = "blue") +
   geom_smooth(
     formula = y ~ x,
     method = loess,

Off-topic, but what is a "mean temperature max"
and what good would it do you to know you if you did?
I've been looking at a lot of weather station data
and for no question I've ever had (except "would the
newspapers get excited about this") was "max" (or min)
the answer.  Considering the way that temperature can
change by several degrees in a few minutes, or a few
metres -- I meant horizontally when I wrote that, but
as you know your head and feet don't experience the
same temperature, again by more than one degree -- I am
at something of a loss to ascribe much practical
significance to TMAX.  Are you sure this is the analysis
you want to do?  Is this the most informative data you
can get?

I had the same question.
However, I can partly answer the off-topic question. Min and max can be important as lower and upper development thresholds. Below the min no growth or development occur because reaction rates are too slow to enable such. Above max, temperatures are too hot. Protein function is impaired, and systems stop functioning. There is a considerable range between where systems shut down (but recover) and tissue death.
In a simple form the growth and physiological stage of plants, insects, and many others, can be modeled as a function of temperature. These are often called growing degree day models (or some version of that). This is number of thermal units needed for the organism to develop to the next stage (e.g. instar for an insect, or fruit/flower formation for a plant). However, better accuracy is obtained if the model includes both min and max thresholds.

All I have done is provide an example where min and max could have a real world use. I use max(temp) over some interval and then update an accumulated thermal units variable based on the outcome. That detail is not evident in the original request.

"Turkey test".


Googling '"turkey test" mean comparison' gives 36.1K results (vs 14.3M

I am well aware of the physiological implications
of temperature, and that is *why* I view recorded
TMIN and TMAX at a single point with an extremely
jaundiced eye.  TMAX at shoulder height has very
little relevance to an insect living in grass, for
example.  And if TMAX is sustained for one second,
that has very different consequences from if TMAX
is sustained for five minutes.  I can see the usefulness
of "proportion of day above Thi/below Tlo", but that
is quite different.

OK, so my interest in weather data was mainly based
around water management: precipitation, evaporation,
herd and crop water needs, that kind of thing.  And
the first thing you learn from that experience is
that ANY kind of single-point summary is seriously
misleading.

Let's end this digression.

+"turkey test +"mean comparison" 84 hits in google scholar.

There is an aphid "Aphis gossypii." Some people have changed this to "Apis gossypii." "Apis" is a genus for bees, and there is no critter named "Apis gossypii." However there are 45 papers in google scholar suffering from this malady. Some of them the error is in the way the paper was entered into the search engine. If I look at the published paper there is no mistake. It is most fun when Apis mellifera and Apis gossypii exist in the same paper.


In the USA, thanksgiving is a holiday that often includes a meal with turkey. Sometimes the holiday is called turkey day. I wrote in the stats lab "Happy Tukey Day". While most things were erased after a day or so, this stayed for several months.

   As a side note, I'm curious how often "Tukey test" is misspelled as "Turkey test".


Googling '"turkey test" mean comparison' gives 36.1K results (vs 14.3M for '"tukey test" mean comparison" ...

Tim, Richard, y'all are reading too much into this. I believe that TMAX
is the high temperature of the day, and TMIN is the low. I'm trying to
compute the average or median high and low temperatures for the data I
have (2011 to present). I'm going on a trip to this area, and want to
know how to pack.

Thanks for your interest.

Rui, thanks so much for your clear explanation, solution to my problem,
and additional help with making the graph come out exactly as I was
hoping. I learned a lot from your solution. Thanks, again, for your
help.

I admire the dedication to R and data science, but the Weather Channel might be a simpler approach. Weather.com. I can search for (city name) and either weather (current values) or climate. It depends on how far away the trip will be.

Tim, Richard, y'all are reading too much into this. I believe that TMAX is the high temperature of the day, and TMIN is the low. I'm trying to compute the average or median high and low temperatures for the data I have (2011 to present). I'm going on a trip to this area, and want to know how to pack.

Thanks for your interest.

Well, I looked for this, on both the NWS and WeatherUnderground, but
couldn't find what I was looking for. Didn't check Weather.com, but if
you can find a chart of the average high and low temperatures in Ely,
MN between about the middle of September to the middle of October, I'll
buy you a beer.

Hi Kevin,

https://weatherspark.com/y/11610/Average-Weather-in-Ely-Minnesota-United-States-Year-Round
Just scroll down. I think what you are looking for is the first graph, but there are about a dozen other graphs on various meteorological metrics. 
       
       Another option would be to use larger cities (Duluth, International Falls, Thunder Bay) and take a metal average. There is a lake effect for two of these more than the other. 
       
       All good?
Tim

Hi, Tim,

I actually did see this chart when I was doing some research, but
rejected it because it was difficult to interpolate the graph for the
three week period I was interested it. I didn't discover until just now
that I could click on the labels on the x-axis to expand the graph.
Unfortunately, downloading the data from this site costs $95/month.?

Also, I found the raw data (from the NWS, for free) and decided to
exercise my R skills to see if I could produce the exact graph I
wanted.

Thanks for taking the time to research this.

-Kevin

Dear Kevin,

You could try the National Weather Service. I can get "International Falls" and other locations, though Ely is not specifically listed. 

h**ps://www.weather.gov/wrh/climate?wfo=dlh
Replace the ** with tt and it should give the right link.

There is a menu.
Select your location,
Select a product (I selected temperature)
Select a year, and period of interest.
Select go.

If you scroll over the figure a popup with numbers appears.

The weather data in R is possible as well.
I would start by filtering the data to remove dates outside my range of interest. Then extract the date (say Day). Group_by the day and apply a max function to the grouped data. Then plot the result.

Tim

Hi, Tim,

I actually did see this chart when I was doing some research, but rejected it because it was difficult to interpolate the graph for the three week period I was interested it. I didn't discover until just now that I could click on the labels on the x-axis to expand the graph.
Unfortunately, downloading the data from this site costs $95/month.

Also, I found the raw data (from the NWS, for free) and decided to exercise my R skills to see if I could produce the exact graph I wanted.

Thanks for taking the time to research this.

-Kevin
