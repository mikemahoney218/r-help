Subject: [R] Shaded area
Message-ID: <CAA6O3zgwrDD81LwB-3i9986wmpbT8=Hr=Dfx2P2=jBb96-Mqfw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R users,

I have an xlsx file (attached to this mail) that shows the values of a
"der" series observed on a daily basis from January 1, 2017 to January 25,
2017. This series is strictly positive during two periods: from January 8,
2017 to January 11, 2017 and from January 16, 2017 to January 20, 2017. I
would like to plot the series with two shaded areas corresponding to the
positivity of the series. Specifically, I would like to draw 4 vertical
lines intersecting the x-axis in the 4 dates mentioned above and shade the
two areas of positivity. Thanks for your help.

Hallo

Excel attachment is not allowed here, but shading area is answered many times elsewhere. Use something like . "shading area r" in google.

See eg.

As Peter says, the list is very cautious about what types of files it
allows. A handy way to supply some sample data is the dput() function.  In
the case of a large dataset something like dput(head(mydata, 100)) should
supply the data we need. Just do dput(mydata) where *mydata* is your data.
Copy the output and paste it here.
