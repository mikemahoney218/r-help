Dear all,

is there a way to read rge hd5 files in R without using hdf5r library ?

Thanks,

Hi Naresh,
The tsbox package on CRAN -
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tsbox/index.html - has the
following description:

tsbox: Class-Agnostic Time Series

Time series toolkit with identical behavior for all time series
classes: 'ts','xts', 'data.frame', 'data.table', 'tibble', 'zoo',
'timeSeries', 'tsibble', 'tis' or 'irts'. Also converts reliably
between these classes.

Hopefully this will provide you the necessary tools to solve your problem.

Good luck,
Eric

The efp() function has been written before zoo was available and is hence 
confined to ts objects. The gefp() function _g_enenralizes the efp idea 
and also works with zoo series out of the box - and also with models other 
than lm()..

Internally gefp always computes a score-based CUSUM process, based on 
which various structural change tests can be computed that encompass the 
OLS-based CUSUM test. Typically, I would recommend to compute the supLM 
test, though, which is more powerful against many structural change 
alternatives. See ?gefp and the references therein for more details. A 
worked example is included below.

> ? ? ? ? ? ? ? dd.lag12 = lag(dd.z, k = -12))

Then you can continue with the following for the full score-based CUSUM 
process and corresponding supLM test with 10% trimming:

dd.scus <- gefp(dd ~ dd.lag1 + dd.lag12, fit = lm, data = dd.z)
plot(dd.scus, functional = supLM(0.1))
sctest(dd.scus, functional = supLM(0.1))
## 	M-fluctuation test
## 
## data:  dd.scus
## f(efp) = 17.128, p-value = 0.01711

The OLS-based CUSUM test is also a special case but then you need to test 
just the first score without decorrelation:

dd.ocus <- gefp(dd ~ dd.lag1 + dd.lag12, fit = lm, data = dd.z,
   parm = 1, decorrelate = FALSE)
plot(dd.ocus)
sctest(dd.ocus)
## 	M-fluctuation test
## 
## data:  dd.ocus
## f(efp) = 1.4991, p-value = 0.02234

Compared to the book the results differ slightly due to different degrees 
of freedom adjustments that are used by default.

Best,
Achim

Not really because the code inside strucchange::efp does not use tsbox but 
just ts directly.

Hi Achim,
My point was that tsbox (apparently) provides tools to convert zoo -->
ts which should help the OP.

Not necessarily, because ts can only represent regular and plain numeric 
time indexes whereas zoo (and also xts and tsibble) can represent 
irregular time indexes of different classes as well. Also, zoo (and also 
xts and tsibble) can convert to many other time series classes (including 
ts) directly, there is no need to go via tsbox for that.

In this particular case it would be possible, though, to convert back and 
forth between ts and zoo because the data is simply monthly. This can be 
done with as.ts() and as.zoo(), respectively.

dd.ocus <- efp(dd ~ dd.lag1 + dd.lag12, data = as.ts(na.trim(dd.z)),
                type = "OLS-CUSUM")

Hallo

I do not have much experience with Linux, Rstudio and ESS, but you can
customise R startup by .Rprofile.site .Rconsole files which are situated in
/etc directory of your installation

You can find some info about it in Rintro chapter
10.8 Customizing the environment

Cheers
Petr

I would also love to find out how to make changes to the way edit() -- or in my case, View(), but that's presumably using the same resources -- looks under Linux. On my 4K display, the font size is so small as to be barely readable. I would assume this requires some adjustment to .Xresources, but I don't know what keys might be relevant. Searching through the source code didn't give me any clues. See also:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64459416/how-to-change-text-font-and-size-in-r-view

The only mention of Xresources I could find were under ?X11, but this pertains to plots, not edit() and View(). 

I asked about this on R-sig-Debian in 2017:

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-debian/2017-October/002776.html

I don't think I ever followed this up on R-devel (where maybe this belongs), so happy to move this there if nobody here has any suggestions.

Best,
Wolfgang

Looking at the source code [*], there is a way to set the font using an
undocumented option, but the its size is still hard-coded to "12 pt":
https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/d3e0e30f6da8ab81f24b04690a9a52d81603b189/src/modules/X11/dataentry.c#L1924

(Those are bitmap fonts intended for a fixed DPI which is likely
different from yours, which is why the font size measured in points is
wrong. I'm not an X11 expert, so I don't know whether this is possible,
but I've never seen these fonts packaged for more than 100 DPI.)

It's possible to get the desired result by passing a string with fixed
parameters instead of %s, %s, %d precisely in the right places, but
that's undefined behaviour and not intended to work this way:

stopifnot(l10n_info()$MBCS)
options(X11fonts = "-*-courier-%s-%s-*-*-34-*-*-*-*-*-*-*")
View(1)

(See the xfontsel command for what XLFD font names should look like and
X11Fonts() for what R expects to find in that option.)

Ivan

Nice -- this is so much better for my aging eyes! Thanks!

In the long run, would be nice if there was an 'official' way of adjusting the font size under X11.

Wolfgang

Subject: [R] alist() and missing variables
Message-ID: <20220502223746.23ae8865@trisector>

Hi,

I've been playing around with formals() and stumbled upon some
behaviour which surprised me:

a <- alist(x=)
.Internal(inspect(a$x))
# @55b0ebae67b0 01 SYMSXP g0c0 [MARK,REF(5761)] "" (has value)
x <- a$x
.Internal(inspect(x))
# Error: argument "x" is missing, with no default
missing(x)
[1] TRUE

Apparently, the elements corresponding to formal arguments without a
default value can be passed to functions as arguments (and look like
empty symbols, which can't be created by as.symbol()), but when
assigned to a variable, they turn missing and can't be accessed.

How can I safely detect and work with such values?

Ivan

You can detect them as you did here using missing(). This is what the
byte code compiler implementation does.
[https://homepage.stat.uiowa.edu/~luke/R/compiler/compiler.pdf]

It's not ideal but it's what we have and not likely to change any time
soon.
