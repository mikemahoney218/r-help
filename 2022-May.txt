Dear all,

is there a way to read rge hd5 files in R without using hdf5r library ?

Thanks,

Hi Naresh,
The tsbox package on CRAN -
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tsbox/index.html - has the
following description:

tsbox: Class-Agnostic Time Series

Time series toolkit with identical behavior for all time series
classes: 'ts','xts', 'data.frame', 'data.table', 'tibble', 'zoo',
'timeSeries', 'tsibble', 'tis' or 'irts'. Also converts reliably
between these classes.

Hopefully this will provide you the necessary tools to solve your problem.

Good luck,
Eric

The efp() function has been written before zoo was available and is hence 
confined to ts objects. The gefp() function _g_enenralizes the efp idea 
and also works with zoo series out of the box - and also with models other 
than lm()..

Internally gefp always computes a score-based CUSUM process, based on 
which various structural change tests can be computed that encompass the 
OLS-based CUSUM test. Typically, I would recommend to compute the supLM 
test, though, which is more powerful against many structural change 
alternatives. See ?gefp and the references therein for more details. A 
worked example is included below.

> ? ? ? ? ? ? ? dd.lag12 = lag(dd.z, k = -12))

Then you can continue with the following for the full score-based CUSUM 
process and corresponding supLM test with 10% trimming:

dd.scus <- gefp(dd ~ dd.lag1 + dd.lag12, fit = lm, data = dd.z)
plot(dd.scus, functional = supLM(0.1))
sctest(dd.scus, functional = supLM(0.1))
## 	M-fluctuation test
## 
## data:  dd.scus
## f(efp) = 17.128, p-value = 0.01711

The OLS-based CUSUM test is also a special case but then you need to test 
just the first score without decorrelation:

dd.ocus <- gefp(dd ~ dd.lag1 + dd.lag12, fit = lm, data = dd.z,
   parm = 1, decorrelate = FALSE)
plot(dd.ocus)
sctest(dd.ocus)
## 	M-fluctuation test
## 
## data:  dd.ocus
## f(efp) = 1.4991, p-value = 0.02234

Compared to the book the results differ slightly due to different degrees 
of freedom adjustments that are used by default.

Best,
Achim

Not really because the code inside strucchange::efp does not use tsbox but 
just ts directly.

Hi Achim,
My point was that tsbox (apparently) provides tools to convert zoo -->
ts which should help the OP.

Not necessarily, because ts can only represent regular and plain numeric 
time indexes whereas zoo (and also xts and tsibble) can represent 
irregular time indexes of different classes as well. Also, zoo (and also 
xts and tsibble) can convert to many other time series classes (including 
ts) directly, there is no need to go via tsbox for that.

In this particular case it would be possible, though, to convert back and 
forth between ts and zoo because the data is simply monthly. This can be 
done with as.ts() and as.zoo(), respectively.

dd.ocus <- efp(dd ~ dd.lag1 + dd.lag12, data = as.ts(na.trim(dd.z)),
                type = "OLS-CUSUM")

Hallo

I do not have much experience with Linux, Rstudio and ESS, but you can
customise R startup by .Rprofile.site .Rconsole files which are situated in
/etc directory of your installation

You can find some info about it in Rintro chapter
10.8 Customizing the environment

Cheers
Petr

I would also love to find out how to make changes to the way edit() -- or in my case, View(), but that's presumably using the same resources -- looks under Linux. On my 4K display, the font size is so small as to be barely readable. I would assume this requires some adjustment to .Xresources, but I don't know what keys might be relevant. Searching through the source code didn't give me any clues. See also:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64459416/how-to-change-text-font-and-size-in-r-view

The only mention of Xresources I could find were under ?X11, but this pertains to plots, not edit() and View(). 

I asked about this on R-sig-Debian in 2017:

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-debian/2017-October/002776.html

I don't think I ever followed this up on R-devel (where maybe this belongs), so happy to move this there if nobody here has any suggestions.

Best,
Wolfgang

Looking at the source code [*], there is a way to set the font using an
undocumented option, but the its size is still hard-coded to "12 pt":
https://github.com/r-devel/r-svn/blob/d3e0e30f6da8ab81f24b04690a9a52d81603b189/src/modules/X11/dataentry.c#L1924

(Those are bitmap fonts intended for a fixed DPI which is likely
different from yours, which is why the font size measured in points is
wrong. I'm not an X11 expert, so I don't know whether this is possible,
but I've never seen these fonts packaged for more than 100 DPI.)

It's possible to get the desired result by passing a string with fixed
parameters instead of %s, %s, %d precisely in the right places, but
that's undefined behaviour and not intended to work this way:

stopifnot(l10n_info()$MBCS)
options(X11fonts = "-*-courier-%s-%s-*-*-34-*-*-*-*-*-*-*")
View(1)

(See the xfontsel command for what XLFD font names should look like and
X11Fonts() for what R expects to find in that option.)

Ivan

Nice -- this is so much better for my aging eyes! Thanks!

In the long run, would be nice if there was an 'official' way of adjusting the font size under X11.

Wolfgang

Subject: [R] alist() and missing variables
Message-ID: <20220502223746.23ae8865@trisector>

Hi,

I've been playing around with formals() and stumbled upon some
behaviour which surprised me:

a <- alist(x=)
.Internal(inspect(a$x))
# @55b0ebae67b0 01 SYMSXP g0c0 [MARK,REF(5761)] "" (has value)
x <- a$x
.Internal(inspect(x))
# Error: argument "x" is missing, with no default
missing(x)
[1] TRUE

Apparently, the elements corresponding to formal arguments without a
default value can be passed to functions as arguments (and look like
empty symbols, which can't be created by as.symbol()), but when
assigned to a variable, they turn missing and can't be accessed.

How can I safely detect and work with such values?

Best regards,
Ivan

You can detect them as you did here using missing(). This is what the
byte code compiler implementation does.
[https://homepage.stat.uiowa.edu/~luke/R/compiler/compiler.pdf]

It's not ideal but it's what we have and not likely to change any time
soon.

Subject: [R] Somewhat disconcerting behavior of seq.int()
Message-ID: <CAGxFJbTpcwho-XxanKdzb4X_U5t-SbbB5LHNCYMz=Vj7ActLWw@mail.gmail.com>

** Disconcerting to me, anyway; perhaps not to others**
(Apologies if this has been discussed before. I was a bit nonplussed by
it, but maybe I'm just clueless.) Anyway:

Here are two almost identical versions of the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
The difference between them is only in the call to seq.int() that is
highlighted

sieve1 <- function(m){
   if(m < 2) return(NULL)
   a <- floor(sqrt(m))
   pr <- Recall(a)
####################
   s <- seq.int(2, to = m) ## Only difference here
######################
   for( i in pr) s <- s[as.logical(s %% i)]
   c(pr,s)
}

sieve2 <- function(m){
   if(m < 2) return(NULL)
   a <- floor(sqrt(m))
   pr <- Recall(a)
####################
   s <- seq.int(2, to = m, by =1) ## Only difference here
#######################
   for( i in pr) s <- s[as.logical(s %% i)]
   c(pr,s)
}

However, execution time is *quite* different.

library(microbenchmark)

> microbenchmark(l1 <- sieve1(1e5), times =50)
Unit: milliseconds
                expr      min       lq     mean  median       uq      max
 l1 <- sieve1(1e+05) 3.957084 3.997959 4.732045 4.01698 4.184918 7.627751
 neval
    50

> microbenchmark(l2 <- sieve2(1e5), times =50)
Unit: milliseconds
                expr      min      lq     mean   median       uq      max
 l2 <- sieve2(1e+05) 681.6209 682.555 683.8279 682.9368 685.2253 687.9464
 neval
    50

Now note that:
> identical(l1, l2)
[1] FALSE

## Because:
> str(l1)

I therefore assume that seq.int(), an internal generic, is dispatching
to a method that uses integer arithmetic for sieve1 and floating point
for sieve2. Is this correct? If not, what do I fail to understand? And
is this indeed the source of the large difference in execution time?

Further, ?seq.int says:
"The interpretation of the unnamed arguments of seq and seq.int is not
standard, and it is recommended always to name the arguments when
programming."

The above suggests that maybe this advice should be qualified, and/or
adding some comments to the Help file regarding this behavior might be
useful to na?fs like me.

In case it makes a difference (and it might!):

A sequence where 'from' and 'to' are both integer valued (not necessarily
class integer) will use R_compact_intrange; the return value is an integer
vector and is stored with minimal space.

In your case, you specified a 'from', 'to', and 'by'; if all are integer
class, then the return value is also integer class. I think if 'from' and
'to' are integer valued and 'by' is integer class, the return value is
integer class, might want to check that though. In your case, I think
replacing 'by = 1' with 'by = 1L' will mean the sequences are identical,
though it may still take longer than not specifying at all.

Thank you Andrew.

My response is: not quite, but you essentially explained it. Just
replacing "by = 1" by "by = 1L" was not sufficient (I had actually
tried that). But what I really needed to do was add an explicit cast
of the sieve2 sequence to integer:

sieve2 <- function(m){
   if(m < 2) return(NULL)
   a <- floor(sqrt(m))
   pr <- Recall(a)
###################### explicit cast
   s <- as.integer(seq.int(2L, to = m, by =1)) ## Only difference here
#####################
   for( i in pr) s <- s[as.logical(s %% i)]
   c(pr,s)
}

> microbenchmark(l1 <- sieve1(1e5), times =50)
Unit: milliseconds
                expr      min       lq     mean   median       uq
 l1 <- sieve1(1e+05) 3.957168 4.001834 4.772071 4.018396 4.538917
      max neval

 l2 <- sieve2(1e+05) 3.98475 4.041709 4.805767 4.068167 4.446917 8.422
 neval
    50
> identical(l1,l2)
[1] TRUE
> identical(l1,l2)
[1] TRUE

So it is the %% generic that made the difference in timings in integer
vs. double. And the Help file does warn about this:

VALUE:
"seq.int and the default method of seq for numeric arguments return a
vector of type "integer" or "double": programmers should not rely on
which."

So I would have to say that it was my error (or failure to pay
attention, anyway).

Again, thanks for your help on this. It made the difference for me.

Something is very different about your system. On my Linux system I get

Similar on an Intel Mac.

Well, I'm on an M1 Mac, so that is certainly different than either of
your systems. I installed the precompiled binary, which may also have
something to do with it. Whether these make a difference I have no
clue.

However, the fact remains that the Help file *does* warn that the type
of the seq.int() value is essentially indeterminate, and when I
explicitly cast it to integer, all is well. So mea culpa.

I will fool around some tomorrow with more careful profiling to see if
I can learn anything, but the best I say at present is: it is what it
is. Unless, of course, someone provides an answer before then.

Just confirming that it's %% in integers vs. doubles on my system:

> s1 <- seq.int(2, 1e5, by =1) ## doubles
> s2 = as.integer(s1)

##  **Note units below**

> microbenchmark( v1 <- s1 %% 2, times = 50) ## floating point
Unit: milliseconds
        expr      min       lq    mean   median       uq      max neval
 v1 <- s1%%2 69.28204 69.60496 69.8957 69.81379 70.01729 71.36125    50

> microbenchmark( v2 <- s2 %% 2L, times = 50)  ## integer
Unit: microseconds
         expr     min      lq     mean   median      uq     max neval
 v2 <- s2%%2L 166.626 167.042 172.7431 170.5215 177.667 194.334    50

I have no idea why the big difference, but I am pretty sure it's way
beyond me. Maybe Mac gurus can figure it out. I may post this on
r-sig-mac to see.

Very likely some inefficiency of the Intel emulator on your M1 mac.  I can imagine it has to do with the substantial differences between Intel and Arm floating-point architectures.

Why not try with a native M1 version of R?

Best,

Thank you. But the binary I installed *was* the "Apple silicon arm64
build, signed and notarized package."

I resolved the problem by reinstalling R. See below. No clue as to
what may have been the cause (just an ignorant wild guess that is not
worth sharing).

Thanks again to all for your help.

Unlikely, but you can download the source file for the package and read it for yourself if it is not in the help file.

?HMR.fit appeared to contain (at least part of) what you asked for.
Have you checked the package documentation, including the package
vignette?

I ahve no comment on what version of the software on what machine architecture might cause the issue?mentioned with differences in speed.
I have a more general question about increments.
The issue here is about creating a sequence starting at some value and ending no later than?another value with an optional step size for the increment that by default is exactly 1.
So how would you normally do this and does it matter?
In some languages like C, the increment can be done many ways including val++, or?val += 1, or val = val +1 ...
Those could produce identical code or different code. The compiler may optimize it or?go and evaluate things twice at times. You might have hardware that contains a registerthat has a rapid increment by 1 instruction built in but not for a decrement by one, let alone?increment by 12.?
And as has been discussed here, data types of various size ints (or float representations?of an integer) may need all kinds of conversions to operate on the same playing field. Who?hasn't used a language where a boolean value can be treated like a zero or a one but stored?compactly and yet if it is added to a large integer, needs some conversions?
How many assumptions can we really make about how someone wrote a function we use??Is it possible that the programmer for something like seq.int() decided to optimize their code.perhaps written in a dialect of C, so that when the default for "by=" is not mentioned, it increments?using val++ while if it is specified even as "by=1" it switches to incrementing using something?like "val = val + by" which may turn out to be slower?
I end by saying I am NOT talking about the complaint here as it seems likely to be specific?to their setup. But more globally, it is possible that choices in how something is programmed?can affect the outcome and assuming it was done the way you would is not always?warranted. Languages that are more flexible, such as interpreted languages that allow?many kinds of polymorphism can be very nice but with lots of overhead as underneath it?all, the deeper programming levels require precision and for each part to be exactly what fits?at that point. You can choose to store your numbers in various size containers, but at some level?they tend to e unpacked and converted before being handed to something in software or hardware?that expects EXACTLY one way. You may save on storage but sacrifice speed or other things.

The difference is small but significant.

By setting "by" you are executing some different piece of code regardless of whether the step size equals the default. I tried by = TRUE, by=1L, and by=1.0 but all of those variants gave non-significant differences in execution time even with times=500.

Thanks. Yes, there is a Lagrange multiplier (though really small for the example). However, AFAIK the hessian is the square matrix of second-order partial derivatives and, given the simple constraint in the example, the second (partial) derivatives of the lagrangian function should simplify to the second (partial) derivatives of the loss function. Or do I miss something? Moreover, I would expect smaller standard errors of the estimated parameters when additional constraints are included, and it is not the case in the given example.

Isn't it the point of augmented Lagrange multiplier, to solve the 
constrained optimisation problem by modifying the loss function and 
optimising the result in an unconstrained manner? Apologies if I 
misunderstood your question. 

Starting on 
<https://github.com/cran/Rsolnp/blob/4b56bb5cd7c5d1096d1ba2f3946df7afa9af4201/R/subnp.R#L282>, 
we can see how the functions are called: both the loss and the 
constraint function are concatenated into the `obm` vector (if there's 
no constraint, the function returns NULL, which is eaten by 
concatenation), which form the vectors `g` (seems to be the gradient) 
and `p`, which, in turn, form the matrix `hessv`. 

My reading of the code could be wrong (and so could be my understanding 
of augmented Lagrangian methods). Contacting maintainer('Rsolnp') could 
be an option; maybe there's some documentation for the original MATLAB 
version of the code at <https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/Col.html>?

Many thanks for the lead.
modifying /etc/.Rconsole, did the job, although I admit that I had to
use the modify the preferences in detault R-GUI on windows to find the right variable names.

If anyone else finds the the red grid of edit(data.frame())
difficult to use, the following modification might be handy. :-)

## Colours for console and pager(s)

background = white
normaltext = navy
usertext = black
pagerbg = white
pagertext = navy
highlight = DarkRed
dataeditbg = white
dataedittext = navy
dataedituser = gray59
editorbg = white
editortext = black


And I confirm that the above work regardless of the client ESS,RStudio,
R-Gui, on windows.

Reading the documentation it looks like there might have been a name change as part of an update. Have you tried kwAllPairsConoverTest? The alternative is have you tried installing an older version of this package?

Thanks for the link! Your notes are very useful. Last time I needed

Understood. I'll be using missing() after assignment to detect such

Subject: [R] Is there a canonical way to pronounce CRAN?
Message-ID: <9156e154-6b8b-f4be-8826-010ceff590c4@demogr.mpg.de>

Dear all,

I talked with colleagues this morning and we realized that some people 
(=me) pronounce CRAN like the German word "Kran" (probably pronounced 
like "cruhn" in English -- if it was a word).
My colleague pronounced it as "Sea-Ran" or "Sea-Run". The colleague was 
a student and has worked at the same institution as an R Core Developer 
and heard it from him personally.

So now I am puzzled. Have I been wrong about 43% of my life? ;-)

Honestly: Is there a unique way how the core developers prounounce CRAN?

Not an urgent question at all but maybe interesting to many of us.

Thanks,
Roland

Interesting.

I have always pronounced it as See-ran. This probably stems from my exposure to other archive like CPAN (perl) and CTAN (TeX) that I have been exposed to. Obviously the latter two acronyms are unpronounceable as words so I generalized the approach to CRAN.

I pronounce it like "Yes we CRAN!" but I don't know the answer to your
question.
Interesting question though : )

Objet?: [R] Is there a canonical way to pronounce CRAN?

Dear all,

I talked with colleagues this morning and we realized that some people
(=me) pronounce CRAN like the German word "Kran" (probably pronounced like
"cruhn" in English -- if it was a word).
My colleague pronounced it as "Sea-Ran" or "Sea-Run". The colleague was a
student and has worked at the same institution as an R Core Developer and
heard it from him personally.

So now I am puzzled. Have I been wrong about 43% of my life? ;-)

Honestly: Is there a unique way how the core developers prounounce CRAN?

Not an urgent question at all but maybe interesting to many of us.

Thanks,
Roland

My personal impression is that in the early days of CRAN the pronouncation 
as in "C-Ran" was more common but this has shifted towards "Cran" over the 
years.

CRAN was named in the same style as CPAN for Perl and CTAN for TeX (as 
others have pointed out in this thread already). Many R users and 
developers were also active in other free software communities and were 
familiar with CPAN and CTAN as well. Hence "C-Ran" was natural.

But because - unlike the other abbreviations - CRAN can be pronounced as 
"Cran" it was attractive for wordplays like Cranberries 
(https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/cranberries/), Crantastic 
(https://github.com/hadley/crantastic), fortunes::fortune("Yes we CRAN!"), 
etc. Also, I would guess that the vast majority of today's R users (and 
possibly also developers) is not familiar with CPAN or CTAN anymore. Hence 
"Cran" is more natural for most of them.

And given that even the founders of CRAN sometimes pronounce it in one and 
sometimes in the other way, I think it is fair to use both pronouncations.

Best wishes,
Achim

It would be nice in some ways if everyone would pronounce the same word in the same way, but then we could not argue over the correct pronunciation of words like tomato or aluminium/aluminum. I think of cran as "Kran". While I had German in high school I didnn't remember the German word for crane, so I did not consciously make any connection. I thought more of words like crunch, crouch, or crayfish to help pronounce cran. "Sea-Ran" also makes some sense, but it makes me wonder if the tide is going out or coming back in. Possibly many think of this like C-Span (C-Span.org). That would make even more sense if we had C-Ran rather than CRAN. I'll just leave "Sea-Run" alone.

Interesting.

I have always pronounced it as See-ran. This probably stems from my exposure to other archive like CPAN (perl) and CTAN (TeX) that I have been exposed to. Obviously the latter two acronyms are unpronounceable as words so I generalized the approach to CRAN.

I had exposure to CPAN and CTAN before learning R, and then there is MRAN... but with no in-person mentors influencing me I decided not to pronounce the C separately in CRAN. The "CRANberries" website indicates that I am not alone.

If R had remained just S, or even S++, would we be debating how to pronounce?CSAN?
I do note in some languages CS is pronounceable. LOL!

We would still be getting our S code from Statlib. There still seems to be a server running at http://lib.stat.cmu.edu but somebody might want to check on it ...

Here is an old snapshot from 2000:

Extended discussion may be a waste but speaking for myself, I found it highly?enlightening to hear that many had a mental image of an alternate way?to pronounce CRAN as it so OBVIOUSLY had a natural way to pronounce.

I often cringe when I listen to an audio book in the car and the person chosen?to narrate gets words not just wrong but very wrong as in nobody in any?country would likely pronounce it that way!

TV shows and elsewhere do the same. If someone asked me to check if?something was on see-ran or even see-are-a-en, it might take me a moment to?shift gears and realize they meant CRAN. There is no real right or wrong way?and we see organizations with names hard to pronounce like FBI or CIA are?often referred to with words like Quantico or Langley based on an area they?are associated with. People like words they can hope to pronounce like?the non-existent UNCLE or even SMERSH and KAOS.

I will say it is quite logical if you see C-SPAN as see-span then CPAN as C-PAN?you might then see CRAN the way you do as C-RAN.

But consider the many functions and packages in a language like R and ask if everyone?thinks or pronounces them the way you do? How many initially read runif() as run-if?until you realized it was a distribution of uniform random numbers in R as compared?to rnorm() for an R version of a normal distribution and thus maybe can be pronounced?more like r-unif and r-norm. Also, runif is part of a related set of functions all having?something to do with a uniform distribution, dunif(), punif() and qunif() so, again,?it hints to some of a consistent way to speak them aloud. Of course, in written?form, they speak for themselves.?
But not everything can or should be pronounced. We do not all speak the same?languages or the same way. Sometimes spelling things out as C-R-A-N is a better way?to go albeit if the others pronounce those letters differently, you end up like people who?think there is a Hungarian word for something like vey-tsey to mean toilet when it?actually is spelled WC as in borrowed from the English Water Closet and the way you say W as?a letter of the alphabet followed by the way you say C as a letter of the alphabet sounds ...

Everyone needs to speak English exactly like I do or else they're doing 
it wrong
  :)

By I pronounce CRAN the same way that I pronounce the first half of 
cranberry.

I too found the discussion enlightening and amusing. As a practical application think about giving or listening to a lecture where the person uses alternate pronunciations. If I am used to "Kran" and the other person uses "Sea-ran" it takes longer to process the conversation and makes communication more difficult. Sometimes I try to get more information by searching on the internet for things that I hear. Just by listening, if someone says "Sea-ran" do I look for cran, c-ran, sea-ran, see-ran, cee-ran, or some other variant? Kran is not much better as there is kran, k-ran, c-ran, cran, and many others depending on how clearly I speak. A novice might hear crayon when I say kran and then the wheels have really fallen off the cart.

Hello,

A while ago every time I typed "cran" on the Google search bar the first 
suggestion was "cranberries". But after hitting the spacebar it would 
become
"cran r".

Now with "cran" only it's "Cranberry" (capitalized) and after the spacebar
"cran r" followed by "cran packages", with a total of 5/10 CRAN related 
hits.

(Duckduckgo.com gives something else.)

And there's also the Meriam-Webster [1].

Subject: [R] legend in plot
Message-ID: <BL0PR01MB4036C827DDB820107DDA0438FAC29@BL0PR01MB4036.prod.exchangelabs.com>

Is it possible to define legend in the plot command? ?That will ensure that legend is correctly associated with the points or lines in the plot.?

# I can do this
x <- seq(-3, 3, by = 0.01)
plot(x, x, type = "l")
lines(x, x^2, lty = 2, col = 2)
# In legend command, I need to remember that x^2 is lty = 2 and col = 2?
legend("bottomright", legend = c("x", expression(x^2)), lty = c(1, 2), col = c(1, 2), bty = "n")

# I want to do something like this
plot(x, x, type = "l", label = "x")
lines(x, x^2, lty = 2, col = 2, label = expression(x^2))
# legend command already knows the legend for each line
legend("bottomright", bty = "n")

Thanks,
Naresh

If the founders had called it the Big R Archive Network we wouldn't be
having this discussion but we'd all be getting our packages from BRAN.

Or how about "Big R Internet Archive Network".... Or would that be
confusing...

In that case, if you were a user without common sense, would you be a BRAN

Hi.

AFAIK in regular plot it is not possible and you need to use 

x <- seq(-3, 3, by = 0.01)
plot(x, x, type = "l")
lines(x, x^2, lty = 2, col = 2)
legend("bottomright", legend = c("x", expression(x^2)), lty = c(1, 2), col =
c(1, 2), bty = "n")

But you could use ggplot2 package with slightly modified data

# just prepare data
dat <- data.frame(x=x, y=x, z=x^2)
library(tidyr)
datm <- pivot_longer(dat, 2:3)
datm <- as.data.frame(datm)
names(datm)[2] <- "type"
datm$type <-factor(datm$type, labels=c("x", "x^2"))

#make plot
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(datm, aes(x, value, colour=type) )
p+geom_line()

Cheers
Petr

With "Big R Internet Archive Network" we could talk about the life of BRIAN, and any references to The Life of Brian would result in getting thrown to the floor by a Centurion. Better than a name like Windows where "Big Windows Internet Archive Network would be Bwian and we might wonder about thpiwit, (bwavado ... a touch of dewing-do), and about culturally insensitive joke names like Nortius Maximus and the risk of finding ourselves in gladiator school vewwy quickly with rotten behavior like this.

Hi Naresh,
Have a look at the emptyspace function in the plotrix package. This
returns the center of the largest empty space on the plot.

Sigh. You _do_ have a source... the Internet.

But to get off the dime, try https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr. Once you have some familiarity with basic programming concepts in R, do read the manuals that come with R when you install it... and for contributed packages, vignettes are particularly useful.

I get suspicious about patterns. A similar request from a gmail account with another username?was made just a day ago on a Python mailing list asking about learning that language. That user?has not responded so far to anything people replied.?
Hopefully this is not yet another person getting their jollies by having others waste their time.
I now refuse to answer overly general requests that tell us nothing about the background of?the person and are not really about more specific aspects of the language. As noted, there?are plenty of free resources on the Internet in text form and even classes as well as free?library books if you live in an area??that has them and of course books and classes you can?pay for. But what works for a person with zero programming experience is not what someone?who knows multiple languages already needs and so on.?
I apologize if I am wrong and see patterns where there may be none. But unless a new semester?is starting somewhere, why would we get such requests in early May?
I also note the request is not limited to R but programming in general. I don't volunteer.
