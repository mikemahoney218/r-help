Message-ID: <l03130301b1bfc7b5e55d@[194.80.128.47]>

I am grateful for the advice of Douglas Bates on my earlier problem in making
R-0.62.1, but I'm afraid I'm still having problems....

I have been installing the various updates to R for quite some time on my
alpha, and it is only now that I have been having really severe problems.

The three or 4 versions before 0.61.1 installed without error. For 0.61.1 I
needed to install GNU make.

For 0.62.2 I have so far needed to
(a) edit the Makefile in src/graphics, as mentioned in my previous email

(b) edit the config.site to give a -fpe3 flag to the DEC f90 compiler (this
is more a precaution in case of fp exceptions in the fortran code)

(c) edit the Makeconf file to explicitly give "-nofor_main -fpe3" flags to
f90 in LDCMD (because it doesn't seem to be accepted when put in
config.site)

(d) install GNU install (suggested by Douglas Bates)

this then produces a successful "make"

Following my previous practice I then make a symbolic link to R from
/usr/local/bin. However when I then run R I get.

...opening messages...

Error: memory exhausted
> 1+1
[1] 2
> a <- c(1,2,3,4)
> a
[1] 1 2 3 4
> help()
Error: Object ".Library" not found
> help(c)
Error: Object ".lib.loc" not found

I don't recall having this before.
Obviously it is unable to find various things. So I thought something might
have changed from previous versions, so I did "make install" which I have
tended not to do before. When I did this I
got group/ownership errors with tar and the make failed. So then (following
the previous patterns) I installed GNU tar. "make install" then worked
fine, But I still get the same problems when trying to run R.

I think I'm almost there....Any ideas ?

Best wishes,
Mark

Some thing is clearly going wrong during the reading of the init code.
The question is "where?". It *is* a bit of a design problem in R that
that isn't readily seen. 

It could be in the reading of $RHOME/library/base/R/base which you
might want to check looks reasonable. You could also try to run
(from the top level of the R source tree) something like

R> source('library/base/R/base',echo=T)

which should rerun the init code, but with echoing turned on, so that
if it stops prematurely, you'll know why.

It is somewhat unlikely that the base file should be the culprit,
though, because it only defines a bunch of functions without actually
executing anything except "<-". 

Perhaps something in the system Rprofile is doing you in. Again, try
sourcing it with echo on. In particular, might there be a problem with
getenv() on your system?

Just to be sure, also check for stray .RData and .Rprofile files. If
the former exists and is too large, that would explain it all by
itself...

>From 0.62 onward you should not have to create a symbolic link in
/usr/local/bin.  It should be that you can run
 cd $RSOURCE
 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
 make install
and you will end up with the R script installed in /usr/local/bin and
all the files needed to run R in /usr/local/lib/R.

Can you tell what the prefix is set to after you run ./configure?

BTW, the reason for these changes is to bring R more closely in line
with the coding standards for GNU.  It is very helpful to be able to
have the sources in one directory but make the installation in another
directory, especially in a multi-architecture environment.

That is what I figured, which is why I did the make install, as described
in my earlier message,  but to no avail. According to the Makeconf file my
prefix is /usr/local. So now I have the actual R script in /usr/local/bin
and various bits and pieces in /usr/local/man/man1 and the R tree in
/usr/local/lib//R.

I have kept the 0.61.1 directory. Comparing /usr/local/lib/R/library/base/R
in 0.62.1
with the 0.61.1 equivalent, the Rprofile and base files seem pretty much
the same (though not exactly the same, obviously)


source('/usr/local/lib/R/library/base/R/base',echo=T) gives
Error: memory exhausted.

source( '/usr/local/lib/R/library/base/R/Rprofile',echo=T) also gives
Error: memory exhausted.

This is quite good, because Rprofile is short enough to copy  in line by
line.

Everything seems ok until
.Library <- paste(getenv("RHOME"), "library", sep= "/")
Error: memory exhausted

getenv("RHOME") gives "/usr/local/lib/R",  so getenv
does seem to be working.

The problem is with paste:
paste("the cat","sat on the mat")
Error, memory exhausted

There are no .RData and .Rprofile files in the directory I have been using.

For additional information:
gc() gives
Garbage collection ...
123580 cons cells free (61%)
1738k bytes of heap free (89%)

I am very grateful for your help and advice. Do you have any more
suggestions? Do you think there is a simple patch for paste?

All the best,
Mark

Subject: R-beta: Problems with graphics on postscript
Message-ID: <E0yrSKC-0000hZ-00@gwdu12.gwdg.de>

I am using R-0.62.1 on FreeBSD-2.2.5. In R-0.61.3 I wrote the 
following R-script to produce postscript-output with logarithmic 
diagram:

postscript("Test.PS", paper="a4", width=10.7, height=7.27,
pointsize=10) plot(c(1:100), c(1:100), ann=FALSE, log="y",
xlim=range(1:100), ylim=range(1:100))
lines(c(1:100), rep(   1,100), lty=2, col="Gray")
lines(c(1:100), rep(   2,100), lty=2, col="Red")
lines(c(1:100), rep(   3,100), lty=2, col="Blue")
lines(c(1:100), rep(   5,100), lty=2, col="Yellow")
lines(c(1:100), rep(   6,100), lty=2, col="Brown")
lines(c(1:100), rep(   7,100), lty=2, col="Gray")
lines(c(1:100), rep(   8,100), lty=2, col="Red")
lines(c(1:100), rep(  10,100), lty=2, col="Blue")
lines(c(1:100), rep( 100,100), lty=2, col="Green")
dev.off()

All has been printed very well. In R-0.62.1 the "lines()" are only 
printed till y=3 (the first three lines), the complete rest is 
ignored. 
Is there a bug in R or is my plot()-command not well designed, 
perhaps the 'log="Y" ' ?

Bug in R, found and fixed just a few days ago (along with the missing
tickmarks). If you're in a big hurry, you can pick up the intermediate
patched version from CRAN.

All my attempts to get R with version nuber > 0.61.1 running on the alpha
failed too , with similar errors after startup as you get.

Now I tried the same compilation procedure as you with 0.62.1 on my alpha
(with DU 4.0D and DEC Fortran (f77) 5.0) and my resulting binary produces
correct results for your tests, but gives other curios results:

[15] 19.666667 21.000000  5.000000


I guess this behavior causes man problems, because many functions generate
internally some index vectors with seq(). This was also my first guess
after my troubles with R 0.61.2 and R 0.61.3 and the alpha.

Have you tried pointing a debugger at the seq() function in
src/main/seq.c ? Or just inserting test printouts at appropriate
places? Printing n1,n2 and s1 and s2 just after the calls to asReal could
be revealing. (Use printValue(s1) and ..(s2)).

Subject: R-beta: Solaris 2.4, R-62.1, and regex
Message-ID: <ML-3.3.899347837.6838.gordon@localhost>

With R-62.1 on Solaris 2.4, configure says the system has regcomp though I do
not know where it is getting that information. The Solaris 2.4 regex and other
regular expression functions are not interchangeable with the GNU regex and
libraries used by sub() and gsub(). Hence it is necessary to acquire the GNU
version and to get it into the load path ahead of the system libraries to load
it rather than the Solaris 2.4 version. It needs to go into src/main/Makefile. 
It seems to me it should be possible to set paths in config.site but I have
been unsuccessful in propogating any flags or libs from there.

"Should be" in the sense that it should be *made* possible, I gather.

This kind of thing can sometimes be fudged by using some of the
settings somewhat against their nature (maybe LIBS="path.to.it/regex.o
-lm -lf2c..."?) but it isn't pretty and it forces you insert stuff that
configure would normally figure out for you.

I think the correct way of fixing this is to add an XOBJS= line in
config.site and propagate it into the link statement in the relevant
Makefile.

Will think about it and, if I don't come up with any obstacles,
implement for next release.

I have replaced the offending paste line in Rprofile with an assignment
to the appropriate string.

I then get the first prompt without a "memory exhausted" error, so it does
look as though this use of paste was causing the initial problem.

This produces

	> debug(paste)
	> paste("the cat","sat on the mat")
	debugging in: paste("the cat", "sat on the mat")
	debug: args <- list(...)
	Browse[1]>
	debug: if (is.null(args)) "" else {
            	for (i in 1:length(args)) args[[i]] <- as.character(args[[i]])
            	.Internal(paste(args, sep, collapse))
	}
	Browse[1]>
	debug: for (i in 1:length(args)) args[[i]] <- as.character(args[[i]])
	Browse[1]>
	Error: memory exhausted

Following on from Albrecht Gephardt's message, I find
1:3 gives "error: memory exhausted", similarly with seq(1,5).

Thus, it would appear that the problem lies somewhere in here. Though why
it should manifest itself in two different ways on our two systems is
rather mysterious. Could there be an obscure long/int problem somewhere?
People tend to forget that they have different lengths on an alpha.

Yes, I'm suspecting something like that very strongly now. Albrecht
seems to have ':' always getting results of length 15 or 17, whereas
yours may be - er - longer... 

Everything seems to be explained by a miscomputation of n in the seq()
C function. If more or less random items are getting in there, it is
not all that strange that you and Albrecht are not getting exactly the
same type of trouble.

The next thing would be to scrutinize the seq  and asReal functions.

That's inside this construction:

#ifndef HAVE_FINITE
int finite(double);
#endif

If HAVE_FINITE is defined incorrectly, you get the finite() macro
expanded at that point and...

So: Are you doing this on clean sources? Something may be lingering in
config.cache from another build. Try "make distclean ; make".
Otherwise configure is somehow getting confused and some
hand-fiddling/debugging of the results is needed. RH 4.2 is known to
work.

When the R-Prompt reappears, I get "Error: memory exhausted".

I tried to replace "abs" with "dabs", but the same errors occur.

Then I introduced a double variable "nd" and replaced the above line
with:

	nd = abs(n2 - n1) + 1 + FLT_EPSILON;
        n = (int)nd;

but nothing changed (nd gets evaluated as 1079069553).

Now I changed "abs" to "fabs", ... and it works !!
The dummy variable "nd" ist not needed at all.

They are clean in the sense that I extracted the tar, did ./configure and had no
complaints, and then did make, and the error happened the first time. I did not
do "make distclean", but assume that was done when R-0.62.1.tar was created.

I'll try make distclean tonight. What does HAVE_FINITE signal? Do you think it
should be defined or not?

It is, yes (or rather, the distribution is distclean by
definition...). The point was that sometimes people with network
drives do

	unpack sources
	make 
	rsh anothermachine
	make clean
	make

- which doesn't always work because of config.cache keeping info for
another machine.

Hmm. Waitaminnit... The logic is that HAVE_FINITE is set if you have
finite(). However, if it is defined as a macro, it should obviously
not be declared as a function even if you *do* have it. 

Try commenting out the int finite(double) bit.

Yay! I though it would be something like that.

This really should be fabs on all platforms, I think. 

abs() expects an integer argument and returns one too. However, if it
is declared properly, the compiler should make the appropriate casts.

Linux has the declaration in stdlib.h which gets included via
src/include/Mathlib.h, so one would assume that it is POSIXly correct?
Solaris has the same.

If it is not declared, it passes a double to a function expecting an
integer, which resets what it thinks is the sign bit and returns some
part of the argument, believing it to be an integer, which is certain
disaster. 

So, you probably want to snoop around in Digital Unix and see whether
it actually contains a declaration of abs().

Correction: It's patently obvious that it should! Otherwise, all the
rounding is in the implicit cast of (n2 - n1) to integer and the
FLT_EPSILON safeguard against truncation has no effect. Fixed for next
release.

Subject: R-beta: histogram
Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.3.95.980703152619.32411A-100000@io.uwinnipeg.ca>

Can someone please tell me to make a density histogram?
hist makes one with count or relative frequency on the y-axis.
I want the density, which is (rel freq)/(bin width)
 In the help I see:

   intensities: values f^(x[i]), as estimated density values.
             If `all(diff(breaks) == 1)', they are the relative
             frequencies `counts/n' and in general satisfy
             sum[i; f^(x[i]) (b[i+1]-b[i])] = 1, where
             b[i]=`breaks[i]'.

which sounds like what I want but there is no info on how to get this sort
of histogram.

Thanks very much for any help.

So if you ever have a data set with missing observations (NAs), you can't
do any nlm() least squares fitting? That doesn't seem right.

Thanks for any help.

freq=TRUE should do it. If you look in the code, you'll see

            intensities <- counts/(n * h)

and that is what is getting used if freq=TRUE. The help text would
seem to be imprecise, though...

I have been lurking on the R-help list for some weeks now.  I am 
essentially a half-time research support/statistical support person 
here in the Medical School (despite misleading title below!)  I have 
recently converted to S-plus from a mixture of SAS, SPSS and 
other things and am enormously impressed and pleased by the 
new power and coherence it has given my work.  However, recent 
disasters with M$ things (notably Word97 and tables!) and some 
problems I'm hearing of with the latest releases of S-plus have 
made me think seriously of converting to R and Latex/Bibtex for my 
basic tools.  Hence a question to the list that is a little tangential to 
R itself but will lead to that!

The question is:

what version of Linux should I get for my dual Pentium Pro machine 
which is now releasing itself from NT (by NT collapsing!)?  I want 
the best and easiest platform for R, possible Xplore, LispStat, 
Latex and Bibtex.  Anyone got a strong view or any advice?

Please reply to me individually, I'll summarise to the list if anyone 
asks, you may all be above this!

Best wishes and thanks in advance,

Chris

Not an easy question. There are both RedHat and Debian users on this list, so
I'm sure you'll get a few viewpoints.

I've been using Debian (and contributing to it) for over three years now, and
am still impressed by its power and flexibility. I upgraded four Debian
releases seamlessly during that time. Have a look at www.debian.org. Some
folks say that RedHat is easier to set up which I can't judge as I never
tried it. It's a matter of preferences and style, much like the vi vs emacs
debate.

That being said, both R and Xlispstat already come with Debian (thanks to
Douglas Bates), as well as a few other numerical goodies, and all things TeX
are provided by the teTeX packages.  I also had a look at Xplore, so I can
assure you that it runs without under Debian.

1. THANK YOU! to all who make R possible.  It is a real joy to use.

2. The following may or may not be (minor) bugs, but I thought I'd mention 
them anyway:

(a) model.matrix() seems unduly finicky: it seems to accept only "simple" 
variable names (x1, but not, say, dframe$x1 or I(x1^2), for example) in 
its argument. model.frame(), however, has no problem with these.

(b) If A is a factor, "mode(A)" returns "numeric", and both "is.numeric(A)" 
and "is.factor(A)" return "TRUE". 

Thank you again,

Rashid Nassar

Yep. In fact using model.frame() inside model.matrix.default seems to
help quite a bit:

R> model.matrix.default
function (formula, data, contrasts = NULL) 
{
            t <- terms(formula)
            if (missing(data)) {
                    vars <- attr(t, "variables")
                    # comes out as list(x,y,z), make it data.frame(x,y,z)
                    vars[[1]] <- as.name("data.frame")
                    data <- eval(vars, sys.frame(sys.parent()))
            }
            else if (is.null(attr(data, "terms"))) 
                    data <- model.frame(formula, data)

replace the 'then' clause (within {}s) with 

	data<-model.frame(formula)

and the behaviour goes away.

Data.frame is being "helpful" and converts names like "exp(x)" into
"exp.x." which causes the trouble later on. (It's debatable whether
that is really smart, but it's S-plus compatible.)

(fixed in intermediate patch version)

> (b) If A is a factor, "mode(A)" returns "numeric", and both "is.numeric(A)" 
> and "is.factor(A)" return "TRUE". 

This, however, is exactly as in S-plus. There is some sense of logic
in it since factors are really just integers with some particular
attributes:

R> dput(factor(1:5))
structure(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), .Label = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5"
), class = "factor")

Subject: R-beta: Suggestion for a very minor change to Rd.sty
Message-ID: <199807051739.RAA06472@ernst.molitor>

Dear R gurus and users, 

for some functions in some of the many packages available for R, with
the current definition of \Header given in Rd.sty, the heading bumps
into the surrounding words in documentation printed via LaTeX. To
alleviate this minor typographical mishap, I'd like to suggest the
change to R/doc/manual/Rd.sty included below as a context diff. With
this minor diff applied, the heading proper is included in a minipage
environment of appropriate size, which results in line breaks
introduced in the heading instead of bumping into the surrounding
keywords for somewhat longer headings...

Best regards,

Ernst

Subject: R-beta: Printing documentation for R and all packages installed
Message-ID: <199807060703.HAA00496@ernst.molitor>

Dear R gurus and users,

in order to provide the local users of R with a printed copy of the
ample documentation provided with R and the optional packages
installed, I have introduced a minor change to the
R/doc/manual/Makefile.

Using GNU find, GNU sed, and features of GNU make, the LaTeX
documentation found in the subdiretories of .../R/library/ is copied
to .../R/doc/manual, and appropriate \include{...} commands are added
to .../R/doc/manual/Man.tex. The resulting manual includes the
documentation available for any packages installed at the local site
in addition to that of the basic R distribution.

Maybe this change could be useful for other users; I'm including a
context diff (against the R/doc/manual/Makefile included with R-0.62.2
in-progress release of 3rd July, 1998) below.

Best regards,

Ernst

Chris,

I can provide some personal experience, in that RedHat Linux has not
only operated well, and is remarkably easy to set up, but seems to work
as well as any Linux distribution with R.  The default X-Windows setup
looks pretty similar to MS Windows, which may make the transition
easier.  In fact, it was the on/off - finally off attitude of MathSoft
toward producing a Linux version of S-Plus that started me looking for a
replacement (at that time I was running Slackware, which also worked
well, but was harder to set up).

I am trying to set up R-0.62.1 on an alphastation running digital unix 3.2D.
I had R-0.61.1 working fine, but have had a number of problems getting 0.62.1
going....

The next problem is that plotting to any device causes R to hang. Looking
at processor usage it would appear that it gets stuck in an infinite loop
rather than pausing for input. I have managed to track the problem down to
plot.new().
Does anyone have any suggestions?

All the best,
Mark

In part this choice may depend on your background, the type of configuration(s)
you are going to support, and when you are going to do the installation.

If you have some Unix administration experience you may like Slackware, as it is
fairly traditional (but BSDish not System V). If you don't have Unix
administration experience then Red Hat offers more Windows like installation and
maintenance utilities. However, if you are supporting multiple computers and
would like to just duplicate your installation from one machine to another, then
these utilities seem to have duplicated the complexity of Windows rather than
the simplicity of Unix for this task. Also, if you have a network, then RH4.2
was a real disaster. I've heard more recent releases have improved a lot, but
haven't tried them yet.

The reason I say "when" is that Linux is a moving target. In general, you don't
have to upgrade unless there is something you really want in a newer release,
but you might as well start with something fairly recent as upgrades are not
always totally trivial. (The OS upgrade may be ok, but getting all the
applications working again may not be.) There are currently at least two changes
happening in Linux which are worth knowing about, as they have implications for
applications like R. (Plus the switch to elf which is almost universal complete,
but just be aware not to install a non-elf distribution.) The first is a switch
from libc to glibc, which I believe has now been incorporated in some
distributions but not all. The second is the release of Linux 2.2, possibly in
the fall. If you are not going to do the installation until then, you might want
to look for a distribution that has made the change. (But I would not delay for
this alone).

If anyone can give a comparison of recent Debian and RH distributions I would
appreciate hearing too.

I don't know how final you mean your 'finally off` to be taken but if I have
heard and seen correctly a Linux version of the Unix S-Plus 5.0 should
shortly be available.

(And I can second your remarks about RedHat(5.0/5.1) and R).

I talked to Geoff Pegler of MAthSoft on the phone today. He said their
release date had slipped and they expected SPlus for Linux to be out in
September 1998.
They'll start releasing SPLus for Solaris first, followed by a few other
commercial Unixes and finally Linux.

To repeat, my problem was that the latest version of R broke my previously
effortless install. Now I get a list of warnings from perl

data                              text    html    latex
perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:

    are supported and installed on your system.
perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale ("C").


I have looked at 
man locale
and it tells me to look in /usr/lib/locale for my locale settings
which doesn't exist on Slackware 3.4.0.

So I guess I have to install a file there?  But with what contents?
Maybe someone with a US keyboard setup can just mail me his locale
file?

Maybe most of you have had no problems because you are using nonUS
keyboards etc already. I guess also that this is the first "international"
version of R.

Thanks for any help!!

I have never seen warnings like the above (I'm using Debian 1.3). Did
you change anything in your perl/linux installation, or was the only
change in the version of R? Which version of R was the last you
used that built without the above warnings?

Best,

This probably displays Slackware's - um - slackness (or Bills...).
Once upon a time before people realised what the locale mechanisms
were supposed to do, there existed a number of halfbaked solutions and
one of the more horrible hacks was that in order to get isprint() to
work with "8bit ascii", the libc library went looking in LC_CTYPE for
the "iso-8859-1". 

Nowadays, there's a much more elaborate system of specification files
in /usr/share/locale (or thereabouts, /usr/lib/locale under Solaris).
Apparently using setlocale() in perl sends it out looking for the
configuration files and...

Well I have
sh137:/usr/share/locale$ ls
de/  fr/  it/  ko/  nl/  no/  pl/  pt/  sl/  sv/

But Slackware is broken in how it handles locale? Looks like I have to
abandon Slackware?? (That'll be a headache)

I have Slackware 3.1 and I have a directory locale under
/var/X11R6/lib.

Assuming you have your locale directory in the same place, try doing
something like:
ln -s /var/X11R6/lib/locale /usr/lib/locale

Otherwise see, if you have a locale directory somewhere else, do:
locate locale

If you can't find a locale directory anywhere, I suggest you
- either ignore those error messages from perl 
- or don't set variable LC_LOCAL (look into files /etc/profile,
 or .bash_profile, .bashrc in your home directory or whatever else you use
 as your Bash startup file.

I do not think this is an R installation problem. When I did not have my
locale directory in the right place, every Perl script came up with that
error message.

Hmm, looks OK, actually. Perhaps you just have the setting of LC_CTYPE
hanging over from older days? What happens if you just delete the
LC_CTYPE variable?

This is what I did to get delete and backspace working properly. I
followed the instructions of
http://www.ibbnet.nl/~anne/keyboard/keyboardprev.html
and I did this part:
------------------------------
                     2. optional editing of custom.map (recommended)

If you want to be able to generate characters such as  in a very
convenient way, you can add a
compose key to your custom.map. To use the right control-key, add the
line: 


keycode  97 = Compose


Set the following environment variable (in /etc/profile, or
/etc/csh.cshrc) for bash and tcsh: 

for bash:   export LC_CTYPE=iso-8859-1 
------------------

So you are saying to delete this line from /etc/profile?

(As for older days, I have had this system running for one year only)

Thanks!
Bill

Shouldn't do you any good in relation to keycodes, as far as I can tell.

LC_blah_blah from /etc/profile made everything work OK.

Subject: R-beta: POSIX and regcomp on SGI-IRIX 5.3
Message-ID: <9807081616.ZM678@spud.me.wustl.edu>

Hey Guys,

  I'm trying to install R on an SGI IRIX 5.3 machine. I'm having trouble
getting R to use POSIX regular expressions. Here is the error message I get
when I run help:

> help()
Error in gsub(pattern, replacement, x, ignore.case, extended) : POSIX regular
expressions not available

I looked through the R-help archives and I found a few tips concerning the
problem. I tried them (ie: I installed readline-2.2, regex-0.12, rx-1.5, and
edited ./Makeconf and ./src/include/Platform.h to use the regex libraries.) and
R compiled and installed with no errors. (However, configure still didn't find
regcomp and I edited Makeconf and Platform.h after running configure.) Now,
when I type help() R crashes and dumps the core:

> help()
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

R also crashes when I try to run the image demo:

> demo(image)


        demo(image)
        ---- ~~~~~

Type  <Return>   to start :

> opar <- par(ask = interactive() && .Device == "X11")

> data(volcano)
Bus error (core dumped)


Has anyone been able to get POSIX commands on R-0.62.1 to work on an SGI IRIX
5.3 machine?

Thanks,
Matt

ML and REML estimates of variance components in many models can be
obtained with the lme library in the src/contrib section of CRAN.
When you expand the tar file there is a subdirectory called SAS_Mixed
with transcripts of example analyses paralleling those in the book
"SAS System for Mixed Models".  If you are familiar with SAS PROC
MIXED that might be a faster way to learn lme syntax that going
through the manual pages.

Also there is work being done to produce functions in R that parallel
the aov in S-PLUS.

Not much to go on there. It might be helpful to perform an autopsy of
that core image. What kind of debugger have you got available?

From p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk  Fri Jul 10 14:35:41 1998
From: p.dalgaard at biostat.ku.dk (Peter Dalgaard BSA)
Date: 10 Jul 1998 14:35:41 +0200
Subject: R-beta: R-0.62.2 is released
Message-ID: <x2hg0pzxwi.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


I have just put R-0.62.2.tgz and R-0.62.1-0.62.2.diff.gz into the FTP
area at Auckland. As usual, do not fetch it from there unless
absolutely urgent, because of the NZ Internet billing system. The
files should get mirrored to the main CRAN site in Vienna tonight and
the rest of CRAN within days.

[This time I seem to have managed to get the release out on the same
date for all core team members -- the Auckland time stamps say "Jul 10
23:59"...]

This is a patch release, mainly fixing bugs, but we have also let some
new features slip in this time.

Here's the top of the CHANGES file:


		CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.62.2

(The new functions predict.glm, poly, aov, alias, biplot.default and
biplot.princop, update.default and rug all come from Brian D. Ripley,
who is also responsible for finding and/or fixing a lot of the bugs)

NEW FEATURES

    o   predict.glm() added.

    o   text() is generic.

    o   update.default() (replaces update.glm() and update.lm()).
        (This will only work if you comment out update.lm and
	update.glm in the sources, or disable them with
	update.lm<-function(object,...)NextMethod(), etc.)

    o	predict.lm() changed towards S-plus compatibility. Intervals are
	still available via interval= argument.

    o	zapsmall() function.

    o	polygon() now handles NAs

    o	options(show.signif.stars = TRUE).  If FALSE,
	summary.lm and similar functions do *not* print significance stars
	anymore.

    o	poly() for [g]lm modelling.

    o	aov()	for Analysis Of Variance [anova].

    o	alias() for displaying ``aliased'' factor levels in (>=2)way anova.

    o	mva: Now has  biplot and biplot.princomp

    o	rug() plot.

    o	new  src/library/profile/Common.R   for	 OS-independent intialization.

    o   new date stamp mechanism (ensures that prerelease versions carry
        correct date)

BUG FIXES

    o   abbreviate() now always retains the first letter. 

    o   attr() partial matches for attribute name.

    o   axis() accepts graphical parameters.

    o   binomial() accepts factor responses.

    o   cbind() works with data frames. 

    o   contrasts() gives simpler labels (like S) for factors with
        two levels.

    o   contrasts<-() now has a how.many= argument.

    o   contour() and image() can accept a list to specify the matrix.

    o   contr.poly() uses orthogonal polynomials (like S) not raw
        polynomials.

    o   data() could fail with a partial match to the dataset name.

    o   density() works correctly if from= or to= are used.
            n= can now take any value, not just a large power of 2.

    o   expand.grid() now accepts more than two arguments, 
        or a list of factors.

    o   factor() and ordered() handle their levels argument better.

    o   family.glm() now returns the correct family (including link etc).

    o   legend() now knows about lwd.

    o   match.args() works correctly for default arguments.

    o   model.frame.lm() did not invoke `lm'.

    o   model.matrix() calls model.frame() if needed.

    o   model.response() now returns names, so glm() gives names to
        residuals, fitted values, etc.

    o   quasi() works in glm() (was missing aic component).

    o   seq() sometimes omitted the final value due to rounding error.

    o   terms.formula() and update.formula() now resolve `.' in formulae
        and tidy up `(a + b) - b' etc.
    
    o   ... is now passed down correctly to functions inside functions.

    o   save.image didn't work (Martyn Plummer)

    o   abs() instead of fabs() in seq.c crashed R on Digital Unix

    o   model.matrix() gagged on variables with complicated names 

    o   saturated models acting up in glm

    o   various improvement of build procedures

    o   rbind(NULL, matrix) core dump

    o	density() default 'bw' now 0.9*(...) instead of 1.06*(...)
				[=Silverman's rule of thumb].

    o	detach(2) now works.

    o	format() doesn't drop names anymore.

    o	format.pval() works with NAs.

    o	print.[summary.][g]lm() functions print numbers better formatted.

    o	legend() now also works properly in  log coordinates.

    o	backsolve() now working;  bakslv.c not depending on
	Fortran_underscores.

    o	Tick marks acting up on log axes in postscript (fix from Martyn Plummer)

    o	The Rd format has a new section \details{} (needed for proper
	Sd2Rd translation). \R was not understood for nroff
	conversions, longer dashes (-- and --- in latex syntax) are
	now converted properly.

    o	prompt.default() now carries "\details{}".

    o	R [ SHLIB | COMPILE ] were broken on some Solaris systems
	due to use of bash syntax. R [ INSTALL | COMPILE | SHLIB ]
	now use a MAKE environment variable if present.
	R INSTALL only rebuilds man pages if they are not already
	up to date.

Now what's wrong with that? ('cept that you don't like the stars...)

There's another problem, namely that setting dispersion to Inf in the
0 DF case doesn't seem to be too good an idea:

outcome3.treatment3 -10      Inf        0       1   

(I.e. same thing with gaussian family). I think I'd rather have 0/NA/NA
in the last three columns. *And* those should be |t| not |z|, i.e.
est.disp should be true, also when there are no degrees of freedom.
Will fix for next release. Obviously, this is not nearly as important
as the known-dispersion cases because the display is useless whatever
you do.

That is not certain. There are essentially two people capable of
getting the act together on Win95 builds, namely Robert Gentleman and
Guido Masarotto who have each their version on CRAN. Getting the
version updated requires that one of them finds the necessary free
time.

However, as far as I'm aware, all of the changes re. glm are in
interpreted code, so you should be able to just grab that from the
newer Unix version. Robert's version is based on a snapshot of sources
immediately prior to 0.62, so should be the safest bet.

I'm currently summer-vacationing in my home. If the weather keeps
acting up, I might get myself up to speed on crosscompiling R for
Win32 with gcc on a Unix host. This has been a long-standing wish of
mine because it could potentially bring the versions in much better
sync.

If I do

Is it possible to access the SE of the slope?
(Analogous to getting the slope like this: fit$coef[2])

If not, it would be handy.

(I want SE of 1/slope, and an approx way is fit$se[2]/(fit$coef[2]^2))

Thanks for any help.

This works:

R> y<-rnorm(5)
R> x<-rnorm(5)
R> coef(summary(lm(y~x)))
               Estimate Std. Error     t value  Pr(>|t|)

x           -0.03052416  0.3854111 -0.07919896 0.9418614
R> coef(summary(lm(y~x)))["x","Std. Error"]
[1] 0.3854111

[Unfortunately, if you use this in programs it may be unsafe if we
change the column labels in later versions...]

Subject: R-beta: Post-hoc tests for R??
Message-ID: <35AA953E.332F5132@spud.me.wustl.edu>

Hi-

Is anyone working on multiple comparisons of means or post-hoc tests
(ie: Tukey, Bonferroni) for R? I saw in the winter 98' archives of this
mailing list that these tests had not been implemented yet, I was just
wondering if
I could look foward to having them. ;-)
I also looked through the contributed packages and didn't see anything
that offered such tests.
I guess I could check for compatible S code, has anyone had any luck
with that?

Matt

  In the last 2 months, I had no time to try to update my binary
  distribution. However, I plan to make an attempt before the end
  of July. In the meantime, please, signal the problems that you have
  encountered with rw0613. I cannot promise to be able to fix them but I will
  try. At the moment, I know the following:
  a) dyn.load doesn't work with some version of Win95 (according to
  Brian Ripley, I have to thanks him for the extensive testing, Win95
  with service pack 1 installed (95a); it works under older and newer
  version; and dyn.load works under Win3.1/Win32s and WinNT). 
  This problem seems resolvable using binutils 2.9.1.
  b) sometimes the automatic loading at startup of a previously saved
  workspaspace fails. However, the workspace can be loaded by the 
  file menu. This is a bug that I have already fixed in the sources.
  c) the console is slow and lack an history recall mechanism;
  This is an indirect question for Peter D.: is the R-Tk project going on?

  BTW, I made a similar (small) attempt. 
  On a Linux box, I installed gcc as a cross-compiler for mingw32
  (gcc-2.8.1, g77-0.5.23, binutils-2.9.1, the 1July snapshot
  of mingw32 and of WinApi (from the Colins Peters's site)).
  Then I tried to recompile R.0.61.3 (my actual windows version).
  And all seems to work. So, this seems a viable alternative.
  Hence, I plan to modify my Makefile's so that cross-compiling
  would be easy.

Yes. This is a consequence of R's (C-style) string handling in
general. '\' is an escape character, so that you e.g. can enter a
newline as "\n". When you really need a '\', you have to escape it
with another '\'. In filenames, you can also rotate it 90 degrees
("c:/claims.dat")

Hello All,
    I saw the previous questions about needing version 2.1 of readline.
Where is this for people like me who are still limping along with a 1.2.13
kernel with a setup that was originally slackware, so I don't have the
debian or redhat package managers.  Sunsite only appears to have
librl-2.0.3.tar.gz and libreadline-2.0.0-bin-ELF.tar.gz
in /pub/linux/libs/ui
Should I be looking somewhere else.

Thanks,
Robert.

In R 0.49 (yes, I've not been keeping up with updates) I converted an
Splus data directory with functions I wrote to use with R by dumping them
to a large ASCII file and then dumping this file in $RHOME/library
What should I do with them for 0.62 (or is there an easier way of doing
this?)

Yes, you may find readline-2.2 in any gnu site. I found my copy at
ftp://nic.funet.fi/pub/gnu/prep. Of course, you have to compile and
install it yourself, but that's usually only a matter of './configure', 
'make' and 'make install'.

Message-ID: <35ADD20A.462B30DA@ozemail.com.au>

Matt,

Here's a Bonferroni-corrected multiple one-sample t-test that I wrote
some years ago.  It took a while to get it into R, as na.omit doesn't
seem to handle vectors and I had to write a quick kludge (na.remove). 
Another more general point was that I discovered that the help page for
t.test gives the name "parameters" for the degrees of freedom, as in S. 
However, the name is really "parameter" as I found after quite a bit of
head-scratching and messing around.

I have some rank-order tests which are similar, and I will see if I can
dig them up as well.  These (and the above) were all written to test
comparisons of the form "which groups are significantly different from
the average of all groups?", which may not be what you are looking for,
but I would be glad to modify them if I can.

Jim

Dear all,

I think this question has been raised very recently but I think I didn't
see repsonses on the list nor did I find the thread in the archives.  (If
it is there I'd appreciate directions ...) 

I am about to install Linux on a Compaq notebook. One important thing I
want to do is being able to run R. I have fiddled with different
distributions of Linux (LST, SuSE, Debian) and can not really make up my
mind for which flavour I should opt (possibly even a different one from
those, e.g. Slackware or RedHat). 

Any thoughts or suggestions?

Thank you very much!

In many respects there's not much to choose between them -- certainly where
using R is concerned. So you should primarily think in terms of ease or
familiarity of installation and maintenance; and in terms of what other
"goodies" you get with a distribution and which appeal to you (S.u.S.E.
has rather a lot on offer in this respect).

Where Red Hat is concerned, note that the latest release (5.1) has moved over
to the new glibc libraries for the gcc compiler (reportedly bringing Linux gcc
back into sync with GNU gcc); I don't know how this would affect installation,
compiling, or use of R. Other distributions, as far as I know, have yet to take
this step.

Hope this helps,
Ted.

My general advice is to go with RedHat or Debian because of their more
sophisticated packaging systems.  RedHat 5.0 and 5.1 use the newer,
thread-safe version of GNU libc (called libc6 in the Linux world or
GNU libc 2 elsewhere).  Debian 2.0 also uses libc6.  R 0.61.1 is part of
the standard Debian 2.0 release.  Right now Debian 2.0 is in beta test
but it is stable enough to install.  We hope the official release of
Debian 2.0 will be "later this month" but the deadline has a habit of
slipping.  See http://www.debian.org/ and http://www.redhat.com/ for
more information.

There are .rpm packages of R for installation under RedHat 5.0 or 5.1
available at the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) sites.  I
create up-to-date packages for Debian and upload them to the
"unstable" section of the Debian archive sites.

RedHat is a commercial product and provides better installation help
than does Debian.  Debian is an all-volunteer effort.  It provides
greater "tunability" once you get past its initial installation.

Distributions based on Slackware tend to be hard to maintain because
the packaging system is not nearly as sophisticated as that from
RedHat or Debian.  I know several people who have installed Slackware
then later replaced it by RedHat or Debian.  I don't know of anyone

Subject: R-beta: base not loading
Message-ID: <98Jul16.172534edt.13447@mailgate.bank-banque-canada.ca>

This problem I previously reported with R 0.62.1 persists with R 0.62.2.  I had
thought it was SunOS 5.6 but it seems now that it may be related to an
incomplete or defective version of gcc or g77 (which I upgraded to 2.8.1 to use
SunOS 5.6). I do not yet have f2c installed but my understanding is that that it
is no longer necessary. There are no compiling errors reported and when R is
started the only reported errors are

Error: Object "colors" not found
Error: couldn't find function "Version"

However, the situation is much worse, as q() is not found either. It seems the
loading of the whole of library/base/R/base is failing, though that is not
reported. It does not appear to be a problem with that file, as Peter D.
previously suggested might be the case.  I can source the whole file into a
version of R compiled with the older compiler.

It does seem that several different libraries are referenced depending on which
version of the compiler I use, but I don't get any reported errors so it is hard
to tell what is going wrong.

If anyone has ideas or suggestions about how to debug this I would appreciate
it.

Jim,

  Thanks for the code! I'm new to R so now I have to figure out how to
'install' it. ;-) Thomas Lumley has also fowarded me some of his code
(bonferroni, holm, and hochberg), which I have included below for your interest
(you may have already received it via the mailing list).

  Since my inquiry about post-hoc tests I have learned that my data requires a
more power method than the Bonferroni. I'm looking for a Fisher routine now
(also known as LSD), which from what I am told is quite powerful in detecting
significant differences among groups. My objective is to determine "which
groups are significantly different from every other group?" and this involves
comparing each groups average to the average of every other group, recursively.
For example, here is a sample output from SYSTAT:

1=group A
2=group B
3=group C

    1      2      3
1  0.000
2  0.988  0.000
3  0.001  0.111  0.000

The numbers in the table are p values, indicating significance between group
means. I'm not sure if Thomas Lumley's code does this, I haven't had time to
try it out yet. From what you have told me I assume that your code doesn't
compare group averages to each other, it compares each group's average to the
average of the entire dataset. That could be useful to me too and I do
appreciate you sending it to me. How hard would it be to modify your code to
compare each groups average to the average of every other group?

I don't think I'm familiar with rank-order tests but I'm interested in taking a
look at what you have written.

Here is code for three p-value based post hoc tests: bonferroni, holm, and
hochberg. Holm is better than Bonferroni under all circumtances. Hochberg
is more powerful than Holm, but under some slightly pathological
situations it can exceed the nominal Type I error rate.

I haven't looked at this code for a long time, but I think it works
correctly. Refeerences for the methods are in "Adjusted p-values for
simultaneous inference" by S. Paul Wright in Biometrics some time in
the early 90s (I'm in the wrong country at the moment so I don't have the
full reference).

Subject: R-beta: error in x11 graphics?
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.96.980721195307.1845A-100000@gamma.fuzzy.at>

Hi,

please could somebody try the following lines:

  x<-c(-808996808,-820483729)
  y<-c(1429449991,372653377)
  xrange<-c(-824726000,-820002315)
  yrange<-c(369266958,373990642)

  # only one point should appear because the other lays outside the plot ranges:
  plot(x,y,xlim=xrange,ylim=yrange)

  # this should produce a line directed to the hidden point
  lines(x,y)

If it would work correct, you should get something like this:

+---------------+ 
|           /   |
|          o    |
|               |
|               |
|               |
+---------------+

But my R (0.62.2 on Linux) produces a line downwards, and if I rescale 
the plot, it changes its direction from downwards to right and to upwards.

Whats the matter?

May be a rounding error in the X11 code? 

Postscript versions of this plot are ok: I tried the plot commands from above with

  postscript("/tmp/test1.ps",horizontal=F,height=7,width=7)
  postscript("/tmp/test2.ps",horizontal=F,height=7,width=3)
  postscript("/tmp/test3.ps",horizontal=F,height=3,width=7)
 
and all looked like my sketch above.

Of course, the ratio between the ylim dimensions of the plot and the 
distance in y-direction between the two points is very small (0.004),
but why should it work with postscript only?

  NaN=Not a Number (e.g. 0/0=NaN)
  Inf=Machine Infinity (e.g. 1/0=NaN)
  
  In addition, x*NaN = NaN x*Inf=[+/-]Inf NaN*Inf=NaN and so on.

Not surprising, R 0.61.2 uses the old version of the x11() function (only
one plot window, no resizing possible).

The new behaviour of x11() [multiple, resizeable windows] is one of the
fundamental changes between 0.61.x and 0.62.x .

I was just wondering: what is the purpose of resizable windows for
graphics, anyway?  The fixed size that used to exist was fine for me. It
must be a lot of effort to get this to work for little payoff. I
personally would make WYSIWYG graphics window (i.e. printed version is
same as one in graphics window) a much higher priority.

There is another advantage of the new x11 graphics: on some operating
systems the content of an R<=0.61.x graphics windows is lost when it is
hidden by another window for example by the R terminal window. On two of
our IBM workstations it used to be a pain to arrange all windows on the
desktop everytime when R was started. Working with R 0.62.x is much more
fun and the advantages of the new graphics are invaluable.

Actually, the two are birds of a feather. The facilities for copying
plots between devices are also what makes it possible to redraw a plot
when the shape of the window changes.

Whether *perfect* WYSIWYG is even desirable is another matter. For
instance a smooth font rendered at 72 dpi often looks so horrible that
it gets in the way of what you really wanted the plot for in the first
place: extracting information. If you want a true preview, it is
usually better to save to a postscript file and use ghostview (or gv).

Are you sure that you really unzipped the file rjune.zip and not just
opened the zip-file by clicking on it? (I am no Windows user, but I
know that you can open a zip-file somehow without really unzipping
it.) I checked the rjune.zip file at our site and it contains the base
library.

I send a copy of this mail to  R-help at stat.math.ethz.ch which is the

Yes, thank You! It's now in the bibliographie of a paper for the german
ESSV (Elektronische Sprachsignalverarbeitung -- Electronic Signal
Processing for Speech) ;-)

I have made the statistical calculations and graphics for phoneme length
with R. It did a very good job! Despite any IsoLatin Characters from
German ... But I have provided a first patch, that changes the Postscript
Encoding from just AdobeStandard to IsoLatin1. So it is not a very good
one -- it works ;-)

Subject: R-beta: Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 'Hamm' Released
Message-ID: <6rn2a0ulx9.fsf@verdi.stat.wisc.edu>

The r-base and r-cran packages are now officially a part of the
released version of Debian GNU/Linux.  They have been part of Debian
2.0 while it was in development.  Debian 2.0 was released at 00:00 GMT
July 24, 1998.

------- Start of forwarded message -------
Subject: Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 'Hamm' Released
From: lohner at debian.org
Date: Thu, 23 Jul 1998 20:01:46 -0400

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Debian GNU/Linux
 http://www.debian.org/
 Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 'Hamm' Released
 July 24, 1998
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

>> News

Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 'Hamm' has officially been released for the i386 
and m68k architectures.

It can be obtained in several ways:

FTP:       ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian/  
CD-ROM:    http://www.debian.org/distrib/vendors (list of distributors)
CD Images: http://cdimage.debian.org/

Debian 2.0 contains over 1500 precompiled binary packages contributed 
from over 400 developers, including all of the favorites: web servers, 
GIMP, gcc, egcs, XFree86, SQL servers and many other tools and utilities.
It also marks the move from the older libc5 to the newer libc6.

Debian's powerful package manager 'dpkg' allows for easy installation, 
maintenance and updating of packages including sophisticated handling of
dependencies and configurations.  Packages from other distributions can 
easily be installed using the 'alien' utility.

Debian development distributions for Alpha, Sparc, and PowerPC are also 
available under the 'unstable' tree from the FTP site.  They will likely
be released with Debian 2.1 'Slink.'  Development is currently in 
progress for UltraSparc, Netwinder and Hurd based distributions.


>> Why Debian GNU/Linux?

 o Debian is 100% Free Software. Our goal is to help keep Linux free.
 o Over 1500 precompiled software packages.
 o Over 400 developers, the largest staff of any Linux distribution.
 o The largest pre-release testing program in the Linux world.
 o Free on-line support from our large, friendly user community on the
   debian-user mailing list and interactive chat forums.
 o Floppy-less install directly from CD, or single floppy install
   using NFS or hard disk.
 o Automatic upgrades via CD, FTP, NFS, or disk.
 o Bug tracking system is publicly accessible on our web server, and
   users are encouraged to access the system and provide feedback.
 o Anyone can duplicate and sell our Official CD or a snapshot of the
   FTP archive, at no charge!
 o Compatible with RPM and Slackware packages.


>> Upgrade Information

To avoid problems in just upgrading packages via dpkg, dselect, or dftp 
(due to possible libc5/libc6 conflicts), a specific upgrade procedure is 
recommended.  This document describing this procedure can be found at:

        http://www.debian.org/2.0/HOWTO.upgrade

There are several ways to upgrade from an earlier version:
  1) autoup.sh
       This is a script that will upgrade the programs in the
     correct order, and even download the deb's for you.  Because
     of the continuing changes to the archive, a tar archive of the
     packages that were available at the time autoup.sh was last
     released is provided.  This is in the developers corner
     of the Debian web site, but newer versions are at:
        http://www.debian.org/2.0/autoup/
	ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/hamm/hamm/upgrade-i386/
        http://www.uk.debian.org/autoup/
        http://debian.vicnet.net.au/autoup/
        http://www.taz.net.au/autoup/
  2) apt-get
       This is the command line part of Debian's future
     package manager.  It knows how to order packages and will
     download them from a local archive, http, and FTP sites.  It is
     able to merge the info from several sites, so you can use a CD,
     an up to date mirror, and a non-us site for the best mix of
     speed, variety, and latest versions.  
     Just run 'apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade'.  
     The 'Bo' version is at: http://www.debian.org/~jgg/  
     The 'Hamm' version is in project/experimental.
  3) By hand
       A HOWTO can be found at:
     http://www.debian.org/2.0/autoup/HOWTO/libc5-libc6-Mini-HOWTO.html
     but as the autoup.sh simply automates this process this is the
     least convenient option.


>> About Debian

Debian GNU/Linux is a free distribution of the Linux operating system. 
It is maintained and updated through the work of many users who volunteer 
their time and effort.

        The command that I wrote can not show the output of abc

	This command correct? I am highly appreciated your kind help.

  Would you mind to be more precise?
  I have just checked your example on a machine with rw0613b installed
  and the results seems correct: abcnon returns a list that you can see
  in the standard way:  
  > results <RETURN>

  There are only one thing that I cannot understand in your example.
  rw0613b is the binary version for Win95/WinNT which support
  long file names. Hence, the name of the package should be
  "bootstrap" not "bootstra". "bootstra" is the truncated name
  in the Win3.1/Win32s version (rwin31b). I have not checked
  the archives in CRAN but the original one at
  ftp://sirio.stat.unipd.it/pub/R
  seems correct.
  Anyway, this should not change the results. rwin31b is different
  from rw0613b only for the name mangling (long file names -> 8.3 names).
  Indeed, I could run your example with rwin31b, too.

If you are not getting anything at all, have you got the library
properly installed ?  (Why bootstra instead of bootstrap since you are
running under Win95 so no 8 character truncation required and the
origional binaries are named bootstrap ?)

Subject: R-beta: An R "birds of a feather" meeting at JSM in Dallas
Message-ID: <m0yzmuR-0000e6C@verdi.stat.wisc.edu>

Earlier I suggested a meeting of folks interested in R and who will be
attending the Joint Statistical Meetings in Dallas, TX, U.S.A.  It
would be a good time to talk about the software and the directions it
could take or even just to meet some of the people whom you see
corresponding on these groups.

I suggest we try to meet at the business meeting/mixer for the
Statistical Computing and Statistical Graphics sections on the evening
of Monday, Aug. 10.  The mixer part is usually quite informal.

Kurt Hornik expects to be there as do I but I may be a bit late
because of a committee meeting I must attend.  Just walk around
peering at name badges until you find one of us.  For those of you who
have looked at my web pages, don't expect me to look like the picture
on the motorcycle.

Subject: R-beta: building libraries on Win95
Message-ID: <7wCOsHAnf4u1Ew48@dsteele.demon.co.uk>

I am using rw0613b with djtools on Win95.

No problem with makefiles building fortran and C dll's, plus can build
R.exe with the supplied libraries (including mva).

Why then do I get the following error when I try to building an existing
library separately, eg...

(/R-0.61.3/src/gnuwin32)$ make -f MakePkg -C ../library/mva PKG=mva
make.exe: Entering directory `c:/R-0.61.3/src/library/mva'
make.exe: MakePkg: No such file or directory (ENOENT)
make.exe: *** No rule to make target `MakePkg'.  Stop.
make.exe: Leaving directory `c:/R-0.61.3/src/library/mva'
[exited with 2]

Thanks for any help

  make (at least GNU make) executes the "-C aDir" option before
  anything else. So, your command is equivalent to
  > cd ../library/mva

  > cd original directory.
  
  But in ../library/mva there isn't MakePkg.
  
  So the correct command should be 
  > make -f ../../gnuwin32/MakePkg -C ../library/mva PKG=mva

AAARGH!

We seem to have found our way onto the email lists of a spammer. 

I believe that Martin Maechler is out of town presently, but perhaps
he can find a way of blocking this kind of junk in the future. (The
absence of a To: field could be used for filtering in this particular
case). Unfortunately, there's no way of avoiding spam entirely, short
of moderating the whole list manually, or enforcing join-before-post
policies and even those are not bulletproof.

Meanwhile, do yourself a favour and ignore the garbage. According to
persistent rumours, sending email to be removed just informs the bad
guys what your official e-mail address is, and accessing their web
site tells them that you have physical Internet access...

Message-ID: <19980727110159.03818@lacrosse.redhat.com>

Hi --

I'm trying to package R for inclusion on some upcoming Red Hat
Powertools distribution. I have started with the 0.61 version
packaged by Martyn Plummer <plummer at iarc.fr> (Thanks Martyn!)
and have upgraded to 0.62-2. I have succeeded in running R demo's
on  i386-redhat-linux-gnu, and now I am also trying to get the
alpha and sparc versions working.

On sparc-redhat-linux, I'm seeing a SIGFPE with the following
stacktrace:

Although I understand what the cause of the problem is, I'm not sure
what the correct thing to do to enable underflow traps on sparc-redhat-linux.

In addition, I notice that the configure for R does not try and
compile with (on alpha) -mieee nor link with "-lieee -lm".  Is that
OK?

Please reply directly since I'm on *way* too many lists already :-)

TIA

Interesting. If you have anything that looks like a deadline for this,
we'd like to know. This kind of thing might get us to modify our
schedules to get a release out so that we can avoid known-and-fixed
bugs to find their way onto widespread CD's (and pester the mailing
lists for years after...).

Eh? (That sentence doesn't quite parse...) Generally, R relies on IEEE
FPU behaviour - as is default on i386 architecture Linux. I.e. SIGFPE
should not be generated upon arithmetic underflow - or any FPU
condition for that matter.

If you look in the R-devel archives (on CRAN), there was a note from
Goran Brostrom on June 4 saying that he had R running on RedHat
Sparc/4.2. 

> In addition, I notice that the configure for R does not try and

Probably not. Getting R to compile on Alpha (Linux and Digital Unix)
was hashed out only recently, and the proper compile flags may not
have found  their way into configure.in yet. Some notes on R-devel and
R-help around the end of June relate to this.

If you get these matters sorted out, we'd be only too happy to fix
configure accordingly.

For what it is worth, I have now  R  running (fine) on Redhat

Subject: R-beta: feedback R-0.62.2
Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.3.91.980727204323.14630A-100000@bio3.acpub.duke.edu>

Some  observations as feedback on minor points that I came across
while enjoying [R-0.62.2]:

1. par(bty="n"): sometimes (depending on data) points appear to
"spill out" of the plot using default xlim and ylim values (are default
axes a bit too short?)

2. points(x,y,pch="c") allows points to plot outside existing plot
box (an interesting feature, but may be a bug?); e.g.,

> plot(runif(500),runif(500),pch=".")
> points(rnorm(500)+.5,rnorm(500)+.5,pch="x") 
                                  #points all over window (pch="c")
> points(rnorm(500)+.5,rnorm(500)+.5,pch=4,col=2) 
                                  #points only within box (pch=n)

3. Typo in locfit() help screen (0.62.1):

 Value:

        An object with class "locfit". A standard set of meth-
        ods for printing, ploting, etc. these objects is pro-
                          ^^^^^^^

4.  Boxplot: The first three work; the last doesn't:

> plot(A~y)    # A is factor
> plot(y,A)
> boxplot(A~y)

> boxplot(y,A)
Error: "+" not meaningful for factors
 
5. summary(aov.obj) does not print the formula (does not parallel
output of, e.g., summary(lm.obj) )

6. using poly(x,n) as argument of lm(): doesn't deal with missing values
in x; gives error message: 

Error: NAs in foreign function call (arg 1)

Thank you.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.3.96.980728201418.1316A-100000@localhost.localdomain>

Hello,

I have installed Venables & Ripley's VR_5.3pl025-1 in RHOME/library/VR and
added the path to my RLIBS environmental variable. In R (0.62.2) typing
"library()" lists these packages, but typing e.g. "library(nnet)" gets
"Warning: Package 'nnet' contains no R code".

It appears to me the code is there and I have checked the permissions and
so forth. The packages that come with R (mva, eda, stepfun) all seem to
load. What am I missing?

TIA,

Robert Burrows

Hmm, installing VR always worked for me. Could you be more specific on
how you installed the package?

I always do
	* unpack VR somewhere, e.g. in /tmp *
	cd VR
	R INSTALL MASS nnet spatial class
which never gave any problems.

Best,
Fritz

The next version of Mingw32 will be out at around that time.  It would
be useful if your new version of R binary had been compiled with it
since the next Mingw32 version *may* have the popen problem fixed...

Mumit Khan comment in GNU list: "If anybody has a "reasonable" popen
lookalike for win32 *and* willing to put it under GPL, please let me
know. Currently mingw32 windres (and other codes that uses popen/pclose)
doesn't work reliably on all versions of Win95 and I'd really like to
see this fixed. Would be nice to have it working by the time egcs-1.1
comes out sometime next month.  I snarfed one from Perl Win32 module,
but my rather limited knowledge of Win32 makes it hard to know how
usable it is."

I have passed on your suggestion about djgpp libc.

Thanks for taking the time.

As in plot(0.5:4.5,bty="n") ?

This, I believe, is a feature. The axes always extend from the
smallest to the largest *marking*, not the entire x/ylim range. To
get the other effect, use bty="l".

That one is clearly a bug (still unfixed).

Needs fixing, but this is in a contributed package which belongs to
Clive Loader. If he wants to use alternative speling...

(I think you mean y~A, resp. A,y there.)

This looks strange. It comes from running boxplot.stats on the
grouping variable(s) as well as the analysis variable. I don't get the
point of doing that... For a workaround, use as.numeric(A), but this
seems to require a deeper fix.

That would probably be a good idea.

A bug. (Happens in the qr() call, needs some massaging to pass
x[!is.na(x)] and place the results in the right rows of the return
value while NA'ing the others.)

I didn't do R INSTALL . . .

Hi,

Binary RPMs for the Alpha are at

I think Martyn probably intends to upload them to CRAN as well.

I am running RJune under Windows NT 4.0 and am a bit confused about where

is, in what directories the various folders should be.

Any help appreciated!

Dear R-helpers,

    I just upgraded from version 62.1 to 62.2 and now am faced with the
same problem I've run into before when upgrading:
  Is there an easy way to take the libraries I have been using in the
older version and pull then into the new version.  My organization looks
like this on Solaris 2.5.2:

  /opt -- /R
             -- /R-0.62.1
		--/library
		  -- subdirectories for lots of packages like:
			MASS,  clus, lme, VR, date, design, mva
			WaveThresh, splines, acepack, eda, stepfun,etc.
             -- /R-0.62.2
                --/library
                   -- base, mva, eda, stepfun

  I would like to move the other libraries from
/opt/R/R-0.62.1/library to /opt/R/R-0.62.2/library and install them.
Does anyone have a Perl program or shell script built for this purpose?
(Or is it an Install option I've missed?)

Matt,

After considerable fiddling around with getting the mode of objects
right (there are still some rough spots in R), I have a working version
of the tests.  I had forgotten, but the 'rs' function will test any
zero-sum contrast, so your paired comparisons should not be too
difficult.  The output is a bit voluminous, but was designed for
non-specialist users.  I'm still looking for the proper correction for
Z-scores.
