Subject: [R] Plotting Fitted vs Observed Values in Logistic Regression Model
Message-ID: <CAMOcQfNC_0yD3hZejgtpMHqFT6GyfJXnhVcUgopiFPDZuPS+9g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear friends,

I hope  this email finds you all well. This is the dataset I am working
with:
dput(random_mod12_data2)
structure(list(Index = c(1L, 5L, 11L, 3L, 2L, 8L, 9L, 4L), x = c(5,
13, 25, 9, 7, 19, 21, 11), n = c(500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500,
500, 500), r = c(100, 211, 391, 147, 122, 310, 343, 176), ratio = c(0.2,
0.422, 0.782, 0.294, 0.244, 0.62, 0.686, 0.352)), row.names = c(NA,
-8L), class = "data.frame")

A brief description of the dataset:
Index: is just a column that shows the ID of each observation (row)
x: is a column which gives information on the discount rate of the coupon
n: is the sample or number of observations
r: is the count of redeemed coupons
ratio: is just the ratio of redeemed coupons to n (total number of
observations)

#Fitting a logistic regression model to response variable y for problem 13.4
logistic_regmod2 <- glm(formula = ratio~x, family = binomial(logit), data =
random_mod12_data2)

I would like to plot the value of r (in the y-axis) vs x (the different
discount rates) and then superimpose the logistic regression fitted values
all in the same plot.

How could I accomplish this?

Any help and/or guidance will be greatly appreciated.

Kind regards,
Paul

Hello,

Here is another way with ggplot2.
It doesn't give you the fitted values but it plots the fitted line.


library(ggplot2)

ggplot(random_mod12_data2, aes(x, ratio)) +
   geom_point() +
   stat_smooth(
     formula = y ~ x,
     method = glm,
     method.args = list(family = binomial),
     se = FALSE
   )


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Subject: [R] Choosing colours for lines in ggplot2
Message-ID: <CABxY9BMwYCr09zfbzfeRMo8TPF6xLJwBRpv1LJ6JpJebHtcdkQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello - I am trying to plot flows in a number of rivers within the same
plot, and need to colour the lines differently, using a colour-blind
palette.


Code beneath works but has colours assigned by the program I have made some
simple dummy data:
## code 1
cb8<- c("#000000", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73","#F0E442", "#0072B2",
"#D55E00", "#CC79A7")  ## this is the colour-blind palette
 set.seed(020823)
 df<-as.data.frame(cbind(rep(1980:1991,2),c(10*runif(12),10*runif(12)),c(rep(1,12),rep(2,12))))
 colnames(df)<-c("Year","Flow","Stat")
 df
 ggplot(df,aes(Year,Flow,group=Stat,colour=Stat))+
   coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 10)) +
   geom_line()+
   geom_point()
 ## this works

## BUT:
## code 2
col.2<-cb8[4:5]
 ggplot(df,aes(Year,Flow,group=Stat,colour=Stat))+
   coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 10)) +
   geom_line()+
   geom_point()+
 scale_color_manual(values =cb8[4:5])+
   theme_bw()
 ## this gives error message Error: Continuous value supplied to discrete
scale

## However this example using code from the net does work so I don't
understand why my ## second code doesn't work.
## code 3
 df.1 <- data.frame(store=c('A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'C', 'C', 'C'),
                  week=c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3),
                  sales=c(9, 12, 15, 7, 9, 14, 10, 16, 19))
 ggplot(df.1, aes(x=week, y=sales, group=store, color=store)) +
   geom_line(size=2) +
   #scale_color_manual(values=c('orange', 'pink', 'red'))
   scale_color_manual(values=cb8[4:6])

Can anyone help? Thanks Nick Wray

Hello,

Your Stat column is numeric, therefore, ggplot sees it as continuous.
To make it work, coerce to factor. Here are two ways.


## 1st way, Stat coerce to factor in the ggplot code
## this means you will have to set the legend name
## manually in scale_color_manual
## code 2, now it works
col.2<-cb8[4:5]
ggplot(df, aes(Year,Flow, group = factor(Stat), colour = factor(Stat)))+
   coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 10)) +
   geom_line()+
   geom_point()+
   scale_color_manual(name = "Stat", values = cb8[4:5])+
   theme_bw()


## 2nd way, since you are using ggplot2, a tidyverse package,
## coerce to factor in a pipe before the ggplot call
## this is done with dplyr::mutate and R's native pipe operator
## (could also be magritttr's pipe)
## I have left name = "Stat" like above though it's no
## longer needed
df |>
   dplyr::mutate(Stat = factor(Stat)) |>
   ggplot(aes(Year, Flow, group = Stat, colour = Stat))+
   coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 10)) +
   geom_line()+
   geom_point()+
   scale_color_manual(name = "Stat", values = cb8[4:5])+
   theme_bw()



Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Hi,

when using 'scale_colours_manual' the colours must be defined as value-
color pairs (i.e. "A"="red", "B"="blue" an so on). If you read the
documentation it is recommended to use a named vector.

If I understood it correctly, in your code #2 R understood the variable
"Stat" as a number (i.e. continuous), whereas "store" (in code #3) is a
categorical variable. You cannot use scale_manual_* functions with
continuous variables.

This should work (please note than I use 'as_factor' from 'haven', this
is a more general function compared to 'as.factor'):

--- snip ---
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
col.2<-cb8[4:5]
 ggplot(df,aes(Year,Flow,group=Stat,colour=as_factor(Stat)))+
   coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 10)) +
   geom_line()+
   geom_point()+
 scale_color_manual(values =cb8[4:5])+
   theme_bw()
--- snip ---

Is the result what you expected?

HTH,
Kimmo

One reason seems to be you are saying sep = "," and there is no "," in the
file.
Also you only have 3 columns of data but 4 variable names.

Agreed. Tab character is not comma character.

The header has white space in it so skip over it, use header = FALSE
and specify the
column headers yourself.  Also use fill=TRUE since the first row does
not have 3 entries.

Hi,

I just provided a snapshot of my CSV file. Attaching the full file
here (not sure if R-help would accept the attachment).

Thanks and regards,

Subject: [R] Problems with facets in ggplot2
Message-ID: <CABxY9BPZ6U5yj91FtPg2ejtX=YA93iCdmd6dX=oKYDg16cCRqw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello  I am wrestling with ggplot ? I have produced a facetted plot of
flows under various metrics but I can?t find info on the net which tells me
how to do three things


I have created some simplified mock data to illustrate (and using a
colour-blind palette):


library(ggplot2)

library(forcats)

cb8<- c("#000000", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73","#F0E442", "#0072B2",
"#D55E00", "#CC79A7")

set.seed<-(040823)

  mock<- set.seed<-(040823)


mock<-as.data.frame(cbind(rep((1990:1995),8),round(rnorm(48,50,10),3),rep(c(rep("Tweed",6),rep("Tay",6)),4),rep(c("AMAX","Mean","AMIN","Median"),each=12)))

  colnames(mock)<-c("Year","Flow","Stat","Metric")

  mock



  ggplot(mock, aes(Year,Flow, group = factor(Stat), colour = factor(Stat)))+

    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 100)) +

    geom_line(size=1)+

    scale_color_manual(name = "Stat", values = cb8[4:7])+

    scale_y_discrete(breaks=c(0,25,50,75,100),labels=c(0,25,50,75,100))+

    facet_wrap(vars(Metric),nrow=2,ncol=2)+

    ylab("Flow")



1)This gives me a facetted plot but I can?t work out why I?m not getting a
labelled y scale



2)Why are plots down at the bottom of the facets rather than in the middle?



3)And also I?d like the plots to be in the order (top left to bottom right)
of

AMAX MEAN AMIN MEDIAN

but if I add in the line
facet_grid(~fct_relevel(Metric,"AMAX","Mean","AMIN","Median")) before the
line ylab it disrupts the 2x2 layout



Can anyone tell me how to resolve these problems?  Thanks Nick Wray

Hello,

The main problem is the way ou create the data set. cbind defaults to 
creating a matrix and since some of the vectors are of class "character" 
all others will be coerced to character too. And Year and Flow will no 
longer be numeric.

You can coerce those two columns to numeric manually or you can use 
data.frame(), not as.data.frame(), to create the data set.
And you were, therefore, using scale_y_discrete when it should be 
scale_y_continuous. Corrected below.

As for the relevel, I'm not getting any errors.



library(ggplot2)
library(forcats)

cb8<- c("#000000", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73",
         "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")

set.seed(040823)

# the right way of creating the data set
mock <- data.frame(

Subject: [R] Technical Help Request for "Version Differences" (i.e.,
 CYTOFKIT package)
Message-ID: <CAHZ-BgrATMoVki+KEm6TaLtnsig-zWP4_N7BCK+=Fyt+Lf4ayw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Ms./Mr.,


I sent an email to this email address from my institutional address
muratdelman at iyte.edu.tr, but could not make sure if my email reached you
because sometimes emails are not delivered to the target due to
server issues and country-related limitations. I wanted to send you the
same email via my Gmail account.




If the email text and codes below are not properly displayed, you can
download the attached Word file, which has exactly the same content.



I am a cytometrist and microscopist at Izmir Institute of Technology,
Integrated Research Center. I operate a cytometer and fluorescence
microscope to acquire data from our researchers? samples and then give them
analyzed data. I need to dive into bulk data to present all of the
information in the sample. To do this, I have recently been trying to
develop my skills in R, RStudio, and Cytofkit package for cytometry (flow,
spectral, mass, imaging mass cytometry) data analysis. I am new in this
area and must learn R for data analysis.





May I request help from you or one of your assistants who is competent in
R, RStudio, and R packages with the installation issues caused by ?*version
differences*? between R itself, R packages, and their dependencies? I
really had to send this email to you anymore, because I could not run the
package ?Cytofkit? and find a solution on the internet.


It has been nearly 2 weeks since I have been trying to solve the errors and
warnings. I am in a vicious circle and cannot move forward anymore. This is
why I needed help from an expert competent in R programming.



I tried to use the renv package, but I could not move forward because I am
not competent in R.


I explained the errors that I faced during the installation below.



I have two computers, both operating Windows 10, 64-bit.



I installed R 3.5.*2* on the desktop (Windows in English) and R 3.5.*0* on
the laptop (Windows in Turkish).



I know that you are very busy with your work, but may you (or your
assistant) help me by informing me *how to install consistent versions of
R, RStudio, and packages/dependencies* (for example, Cytofkit, ggplot2,
Rtools, devtools, plyr, shiny, GUI)?



I guess I will need exact web page links "*in* *an orderly manner" to
download* the correct versions of everything.



I would appreciate it if you could advise me or forward this email to one
of your assistants or experts.




I really appreciate any help you can provide.




Kind Regards

Subject: [R] Multiply
Message-ID: <CAJOiR6Y-qZL=N8Cb_VZwsRdxzDhkUG8+uhJOvvZB=3YC4TA1VA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I want to multiply two  data frames as shown below,

dat1 <-read.table(text="ID, x, y, z
 A, 10,  34, 12
 B, 25,  42, 18
 C, 14,  20,  8 ",sep=",",header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=F)

dat2 <-read.table(text="ID, weight, weiht2
 A,  0.25, 0.35
 B,  0.42, 0.52
 C,  0.65, 0.75",sep=",",header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=F)

Desired result

ID  Index1 Index2
1  A 24.58 30.18
2  B 35.59 44.09
3  C 17.10 21.30

Here is my attempt,  but did not work

dat3 <- data.frame(ID = dat1[,1], Index = apply(dat1[,-1], 1, FUN=
function(x) {sum(x*dat2[,2:ncol(dat2)])} ), stringsAsFactors=F)


Any help?

Thank you,

You mean as in matrix multiplication? Nice of you to show the desired
result, otherwise I wouldn't be sure what you meant. You can employ the
matrix multiplication operator %*% if you use as.matrix and omit the
non-numeric parts:

as.matrix(dat1[,-1]) %*% as.matrix(dat2[match(dat1[,1], dat2[,1]),-1])
#      weight weiht2
# [1,]  24.58  30.18
# [2,]  35.59  44.09
# [3,]  17.10  21.30

The [,-1] part drops the 'ID' column and the match() on the first
columns of both data frames ensures the correct row order. Omit the
match(...) if you have a guarantee that the samples appear in the same
order (A, B, C) in both dat1 and dat2.

Once the calculation is done, you can construct a data frame again
using something like data.frame(ID = dat1[,1], Index = multiplication).

Ivan

Val,

A data.frame is not quite the same thing as a matrix.

But as long as everything is numeric, you can convert both data.frames to
matrices, perform the computations needed and, if you want, convert it back
into a data.frame.

BUT it must be all numeric and you violate that requirement by having a
character column for ID. You need to eliminate that temporarily:

dat1 <- read.table(text="ID, x, y, z
 A, 10,  34, 12
 B, 25,  42, 18
 C, 14,  20,  8 ",sep=",",header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=F)

mat1 <- as.matrix(dat1[,2:4])

The result is:

> mat1
      x  y  z
[1,] 10 34 12
[2,] 25 42 18
[3,] 14 20  8

Now do the second matrix, perhaps in one step:

mat2 <- as.matrix(read.table(text="ID, weight, weiht2
 A,  0.25, 0.35
 B,  0.42, 0.52
 C,  0.65, 0.75",sep=",",header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=F)[,2:3])


Do note some people use read.csv() instead of read.table, albeit it simply
calls read.table after setting some parameters like the comma.

The result is what you asked for, including spelling weight wrong once.:

> mat2
     weight weiht2
[1,]   0.25   0.35
[2,]   0.42   0.52
[3,]   0.65   0.75

Now you wanted to multiply as in matrix multiplication.

> mat1 %*% mat2
     weight weiht2
[1,]  24.58  30.18
[2,]  35.59  44.09
[3,]  17.10  21.30

Of course, you wanted different names for the columns and you can do that
easily enough:

result <- mat1 %*% mat2

colnames(result) <- c("index1", "index2")


But this is missing something:

> result
     index1 index2
[1,]  24.58  30.18
[2,]  35.59  44.09
[3,]  17.10  21.30

Do you want a column of ID numbers on the left? If numeric, you can keep it
in a matrix in one of many ways but if you want to go back to the data.frame
format and re-use the ID numbers, there are again MANY ways. But note mixing
characters and numbers can inadvertently convert everything to characters.

Here is one solution. Not the only one nor the best one but reasonable:

recombined <- data.frame(index=dat1$ID, 
                         index1=result[,1], 
                         index2=result[,2])


> recombined
  index index1 index2
1     A  24.58  30.18
2     B  35.59  44.09
3     C  17.10  21.30

If for some reason you need a more general purpose way to do this for
arbitrary conformant matrices, you can write a function that does this in a
more general way but perhaps a better idea might be a way to store your
matrices in files in a way that can be read back in directly or to not
include indices as character columns but as row names.

Hi all,

I want to multiply two  data frames as shown below,

dat1 <-read.table(text="ID, x, y, z
 A, 10,  34, 12
 B, 25,  42, 18
 C, 14,  20,  8 ",sep=",",header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=F)

dat2 <-read.table(text="ID, weight, weiht2
 A,  0.25, 0.35
 B,  0.42, 0.52
 C,  0.65, 0.75",sep=",",header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=F)

Desired result

ID  Index1 Index2
1  A 24.58 30.18
2  B 35.59 44.09
3  C 17.10 21.30

Here is my attempt,  but did not work

dat3 <- data.frame(ID = dat1[,1], Index = apply(dat1[,-1], 1, FUN=
function(x) {sum(x*dat2[,2:ncol(dat2)])} ), stringsAsFactors=F)


Any help?

Thank you,

Dear Murat:

See the "posting guide" (link below) for how and what to post on this list.

I believe that in that guide it is recommended that you first update
your R version and packages to the latest versions (R 3.5 is rather
old now). You should probably reinstall R and all packages from the
main CRAN website:
https://cran.r-project.org/

Note that once you install R, you can read ?install.packages for how
to install the latest versions of all the packages you need that are
on CRAN.

Note that R and RStudio are different software products. So once R is
installed, you can download and install the packages you need from the
Posit website if you prefer, again with the latest versions.

If for some reason CRAN is not available to you or some of the
packages you need are not on CRAN(e.g. github only packages)  or won't
run on your computer, then the process will be more complicated, and
others will have to help you. CRAN has a rigorous process for assuring
compatibility of packages and R versions, so that packages not on CRAN
may not be compatible with the latest R version. All I can suggest is
that you avoid such packages **if possible** (I understand that it may
not be). You can search CRAN's "Task Views" (link on
https://cran.r-project.org/ )for alternative CRAN packages that may
have the functionality you seek.

Cheers,
Bert

Thank you,  Avi and Ivan.  Worked for this particular Example.

Yes, I am looking for something with a more general purpose.
I think Ivan's suggestion works for this.

multiplication=as.matrix(dat1[,-1]) %*% as.matrix(dat2[match(dat1[,1],
dat2[,1]),-1])
Res=data.frame(ID = dat1[,1], Index = multiplication)

Hi Murat,
I am not sure why you are using R 3.5.
CRAN has R 4.3.1

https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/

I suggest you start over and install R 4.3.1 and then your cytofkit
install might work.

Good luck,
Eric

Hello,

Slightly simpler:



multiplication <- as.matrix(dat1[,-1]) %*% 
as.matrix(dat2[match(dat1[,1], dat2[,1]),-1])
Res <- data.frame(ID = dat1[,1], Index = multiplication)

# this is what I find simpler
# the method being called is cbind.data.frame
Res2 <- cbind(dat1[1], Index = multiplication)

identical(Res, Res2)
#> [1] TRUE


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

 CYTOFKIT package)

Dear Murat Delman,

Both your messages came through, and I'm replying to the one that was
the first chronologically.

I have taken a look at the cytofkit package. It used to be a
Bioconductor package, but was removed, most likely because it failed to
build and pass a check: https://support.bioconductor.org/p/128865

Installing cytofkit will involve spending a lot of effort: you need an
old Bioconductor release, hence an old version of R, hence likely old,
archived version of the dependencies, and to build the packages from
source because CRAN doesn't serve Windows binaries for old versions of
R. In this light, may I suggest looking for alternative packages that
currently pass their checks on CRAN or Bioconductor? That support
thread above has some suggestions, though I lack the expertise to judge
them. In particular, the cytofWorkflow vignette and the scDataviz
package look promising.

For "basic R literacy", I can recommend this free book by A. Shipunov:
http://web.archive.org/web/20230501112111/http://ashipunov.info/shipunov/school/biol_240/en/visual_statistics.pdf

In order to install packages from the current release of Bioconductor,
follow the guide at https://bioconductor.org/install/.

Good luck!

Ivan

[See the end for an interesting twist on moving a column to row.names.]

Yes, many ways to do things exist but it may make sense to ask for what the user/OP really wants. Sometimes the effort to make a brief example obscures things.

Was there actually any need to read in a file containing comma-separated values? Did it have to include one, or perhaps more, non-numeric columns? Was the ID column guaranteed to exist and be named ID or just be the first column? Is any error checking needed?

So assuming we read in two data structures into data.frames called A and B to be unoriginal. A wider approach might be to split A into A.text and A.numeric by checking which columns test as numeric (meaning is.numeric() return TRUE) and which can be text or logical or anything else. Note that complex is not considered numeric if that matters.

You might then count the number of rows and columns of A.numeric and set A.text Aside for now. 

You then get B and it seems you can throw away any non-numeric columns. The resulting numeric columns can be in B.numeric.
The number of rows and columns of what remains need to conform to the dimensions of A in the sense that if a is M rows by N columns, then B must be N x anything and the result of the multiplication is M x anything. If the condition is not met, you need to fail gracefully.

You may also want to decide what to do with data that came with things like NA content. Or, if your design allows content that can be converted to numeric, check and make any conversions.

Then you can convert the data into matrices, perform the matrix multiplication and optionally restore any column names you want along with any of the non-numeric columns you held back and note there could possible be more than one. Obviously, getting multiple ones in the original order is harder.

I am not sure if you are interested in another tweak. For some purposes, rownames() and colnames() make sense instead of additional rows or columns.

A line of code like this applied to a data.frame will copy your id column as a rowname then remove the actual ID column.

> dat1
  ID  x  y  z
1  A 10 34 12
2  B 25 42 18
3  C 14 20  8
> rownames(dat1) <- dat1$ID
> dat1$ID <- NULL
> dat1
    x  y  z
 A 10 34 12
 B 25 42 18
 C 14 20  8

> result <- as.matrix(dat1) %*% mat2
> result
   weight weiht2
 A  24.58  30.18
 B  35.59  44.09
 C  17.10  21.30

There are functions (perhaps in packages, with names like column_to_rownames() in the tidyverse packages that can be used and you can also reverse the process.

Just some thoughts. The point is that it is often wiser to not mix text with numeric and rownames and colnames provide a way to include the text for the purposes you want and not for others where they are in the way. And here is an oddity I found:

> dat2
  ID weight weiht2
1  A   0.25   0.35
2  B   0.42   0.52
3  C   0.65   0.75
> temp <- data.frame(dat2, row.names=1)
> temp
   weight weiht2
 A   0.25   0.35
 B   0.42   0.52
 C   0.65   0.75

As shown, when you create a data.frame you can move any column by NUMBER into rownames. So consider your early code and note read.table supports the option row.names=1 and passes it on so in one step:

> ?read.table
> dat1 <-read.table(text="ID, x, y, z
+ A, 10,  34, 12
+ B, 25,  42, 18
+ C, 14,  20,  8 ",sep=",",header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=F, row.names=1)
> dat1
   x  y  z
A 10 34 12
B 25 42 18
C 14 20  8

You can make it a matrix immediately:

mat1 <- as.matrix(read.table(
  text = text,
  sep = ",",
  header = TRUE,
  stringsAsFactors = F,
  row.names = 1
))

Thank you,  Avi and Ivan.  Worked for this particular Example.

Yes, I am looking for something with a more general purpose.
I think Ivan's suggestion works for this.

multiplication=as.matrix(dat1[,-1]) %*% as.matrix(dat2[match(dat1[,1],
dat2[,1]),-1])
Res=data.frame(ID = dat1[,1], Index = multiplication)

You could also do

dim(x) <- c(length(x), 1)

Steve,

As Iris pointed out, some implementations of a matrix are actually of a vector with special qualities. There are sometimes choices whether to store it a row at a time or a column at a time.

In R, your data consisted of the integers from 1 to 20 and they clearly are stored a column at a time:

> x<-matrix(1:20,5,4)
> 
> x
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    6   11   16
[2,]    2    7   12   17
[3,]    3    8   13   18
[4,]    4    9   14   19
[5,]    5   10   15   20

Your method involved creating a second matrix/ But you could as easily ask for a vector that gives you back the info in that order:

> as.vector(x)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

Iris mentioned the fact that the version of built-in matrices you are using in R is actually a vector with an attribute:

> attributes(x)
$dim
[1] 5 4

This means that when you try to work with the matrix and ask for x[3,4] it does a calculation on where in the vector to look and since you want column 4, it means three columns with five things are ahead of it meaning 15 items. Then it sees you want the third item in this fourth column so it adds 3 to make 18 and looks at the 18th item in the vector:

> x<-matrix(data=1:20,nrow=5, ncol=4, byrow=TRUE)
> x
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    2    3    4
[2,]    5    6    7    8
[3,]    9   10   11   12
[4,]   13   14   15   16
[5,]   17   18   19   20

This is now stored differently:

> x[18]
[1] 12

> as.vector(x)
 [1]  1  5  9 13 17  2  6 10 14 18  3  7 11 15 19  4  8 12 16 20

And just FYI, you can make multidimensional arrays using the array() function that as far as I know are just extensions of the same analysis with a dim attribute containg the dimensions.



> x[3,4]
[1] 18
> x[18]
[1] 18
> as.vector(x)[18]
[1] 18

The latter two approaches get to look at the pure vector implementation. So your data is already in the order you want and it is just a question of how to access it.

Rather than copying the matrix, if not needed for another purpose, changing the attribute lets you reshape it in many ways, including a 2x10 matrix but also into a vertical or horizontal matrix of 1x20 or 20x1. Of course, if you will be passing the object around to places that expect a vector, it would be safer. Inn this case, it does seem like it becomes seen like any vector.

> length(x)
[1] 20
> str(x)
 int [1:5, 1:4] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...

> attr(x, "dim") <- c(length(x), 1)
> dim(x)
[1] 20  1
> str(x)
 int [1:20, 1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
> typeof(x)
[1] "integer"

But please note my comments above do not apply the same if you make the matric by rows as in:

Or just dim(x) <- NULL.
(as matrices in base R are just vectors with a dim attribute stored in
column major order)

ergo:

> x
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

## well, you get it...

Stacking columns of a matrix is a standard operation in multilinear
algebra, usually written as the operator vec().
I checked to see if there is an R package that deals with multilinear
algebra. I found rTensor, which has a function vec().
So, yet another way to accomplish what you want would be:

> library(rTensor)
> vec(as.tensor(x))

Eric,

I am not sure your solution is particularly economical albeit it works for arbitrary arrays of any dimension, presumably. But it seems to involve converting a matrix to a tensor just to undo it back to a vector. Other solutions offered here, simply manipulate the dim attribute of the data structure.

Of course, the OP may have uses in mind which the package might make easier. We often get fairly specific questions here without the additional context that may help guide a better answer.

Stacking columns of a matrix is a standard operation in multilinear
algebra, usually written as the operator vec().
I checked to see if there is an R package that deals with multilinear
algebra. I found rTensor, which has a function vec().
So, yet another way to accomplish what you want would be:

> vec(as.tensor(x))

Eric,

I fully agreed with you that anyone doing serious work in various projects such as machine learning that make heavy use of mathematical data structures  would do well to find some decent well designed and possibly efficient packages to do much of the work rather than re-inventing their own way. As you note, it can be quite common to do things like flatten a matrix (or higher order array) into a vector and do tasks like image recognition using the vector form. 

Mind you, there are other packages that might be a better entry point than rTensor and which incorporate that package or similar ones for the user but supply other high-level ways to do things like set up neural networks. 

I think the primary focus of this group has been to deal with how to do things within a main R distribution and when people start suggesting ways using other packages, such as in the tidyverse, that not everyone knows or uses, then there is sometimes feedback suggesting a return to more standard topics. Personally, I am happy to look at any well-known and appreciated packages even if maintained by another company as long as it helps get work done easily. 

I downloaded rTensor just to take a look and see how it implements vec():

> vec
nonstandardGenericFunction for "vec" defined from package "rTensor"

function (tnsr) 
{
    standardGeneric("vec")
}

So, no, they do not directly use the trick of setting the dim attribute and that may be because they are not operating on a naked matrix/vector but on an enhanced version that wraps it as a tensor. 

I experimented with making a small matrix and calling as.tensor() on it and it is quite a bit more complex:

> attributes(mymat)
$dim
[1] 3 4

> attributes(mytens)
$num_modes
[1] 2

$modes
[1] 3 4

$data
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    4    7   10
[2,]    2    5    8   11
[3,]    3    6    9   12

$class
[1] "Tensor"
attr(,"package")
[1] "rTensor"

This makes sense given that it has to store something more complex. Mind you, an R array does it simpler. I am confident this design has advantages for how the rTensor package does many other activities. It is more than is needed if the OP really has a simple case use.

I do note the vec() function produces the same result as one of the mentioned solutions of setting the dim attribute to NULL. 

It would not surprise me if other packages like TensorFlow or ones built on top of it like Keras, also have their own ways to do this simple task. The OP may want to choose a specific package instead, or as well, for meeting their other needs.

Based on a private communication, it sounds like Steven is asking the question again because he wants a different solution that may be the way this might be done in another language. I think he wants to use loops explicitly and I suspect this may be along the lines of a homework problem for him.

R has loops and if you loop over some variable moving "col" from 1 to the number of columns, then if your matrix is called "mat" you can use mat[,col] to grab a whole column at a time and concatenate the results gradually into one longer vector.

If you want a more loopy solution, simply reserve a vector big enough to hold an M by N matric (size is M*N) and loop over both "row" and "col" and keep adding mat[row,col] to your growing vector.

As stated, this is not the way many people think in R, especially those of us who know a matrix is just a vector with a bonus.

Hello,

Yet another solution.


t(t(c(x)))

or

x |> c() |> t() |> t()


At first I liked it but it's the slowest of the three, OP's, Iris' (the 
fastest).

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

This topic is getting almost funny as there are an indefinite ever-sillier
set of ways to perform the action and even more if you include packages like
purr.

If mymat is a matrix, several variants work such as:

> mymat
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    4    7   10
[2,]    2    5    8   11
[3,]    3    6    9   12
> unlist(as.list(mymat))
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12 
> as.vector(unlist(as.data.frame(mymat)))
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12

But as noted repeatedly, since underneath it all, mymat is a vector with a
dim attribute, the trivial solution is to set that to NULL or make it 1-D so
the internal algorithm works.

Still, if brute force programming as is done in earlier languages is
important to someone, and you do not want to do it in a language like C,
this would work too.


You could use a for loop in a brute force approach. Here is an example of a
function that I think does what you want and accepts not just matrices (2D
only, no arrays) of any kind but also data.frame or tibble objects as well
as row or column vectors..

mat2vec <- function(mat) {
  # Accept a matrix of any type and return it as
  # a vector stacked by columns.
  
  # Do it the dumb way for illustration.
  
  # If fed a data.frame or tibble, convert it to a matrix first.
  # And handle row or column vectors
  if (is.data.frame(mat)) mat <- as.matrix(mat)
  if (is.vector(mat)) mat <- as.matrix(mat)
  
  # Calculate the rows and columns and the typeof
  # to initialize a vector to hold the result.
  rows <- dim(mat)[1L]
  cols <- dim(mat)[2L]
  type <- typeof(mat)
  result <- vector(length=rows*cols, mode=type)
  
  index <- 1
  
  # Double loop to laboriously copy the items to the result
  
  for (col in 1:cols) {
    for (row in 1:rows) {
      result[index] <- mat[row, col]
      index <- index + 1
    } # end inner loop on rows
  } # end outer loop on cols
  
  return (result)
} # end function daffynition mat2vec

Checking if it works on many cases:

> mymat
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    4    7   10
[2,]    2    5    8   11
[3,]    3    6    9   12
> mat2vec(mymat)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12

> mydf
  V1 V2 V3 V4
1  1  4  7 10
2  2  5  8 11
3  3  6  9 12
> mat2vec(mydf)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12

> mytib
# A tibble: 3 ? 4
     V1    V2    V3    V4
  <int> <int> <int> <int>
1     1     4     7    10
2     2     5     8    11
3     3     6     9    12
> mat2vec(mytib)
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12

> myboolmat <- mymat <= 5
> myboolmat
     [,1]  [,2]  [,3]  [,4]
[1,] TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
[2,] TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE
[3,] TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE
> mat2vec(myboolmat)
 [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE

Is it bulletproof? Nope. I could make sure it is not any other type or not a
type that cannot be coerced into something like a matrix, or perhaps is of
higher dimensionality.

But as noted, if you already have a valid matrix object, there is a trivial
way to get it by row.

Hello,

Yet another solution.


t(t(c(x)))

or

x |> c() |> t() |> t()


At first I liked it but it's the slowest of the three, OP's, Iris' (the
fastest).

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Subject: [R] group consecutive dates in a row
Message-ID: <8a813abd71a3430ba64edc87d6046ec7@regione.marche.it>

Dear R users,

I have a data frame with a single column of POSIXct elements, like


mydf <- data.frame(data_POSIX=as.POSIXct(c("2012-02-05", "2012-02-06", "2012-02-07", "2012-02-13", "2012-02-21"), format = "%Y-%m-%d", tz="Etc/GMT-1"))


I need to transform it in a two-columns data frame where I can get rid of consecutive dates. It should appear like


data_POSIX_init data_POSIX_fin

2012-02-05 2012-02-07

2012-02-13 NA

2012-02-21 NA


I started with two "while cycles" and so on, but this is not an efficient way to do it.

Could you please give me an hint on how to proceed?


Thank you for your precious attention and help

Stefano

rle(as.numeric(diff(mydf$data_POSIX)))  should get you started, I think?

Here is another way to obtain the day differences that is the argument
of rle() . It is perhaps more reliable in that it uses methods for
class POSIXct rather than depending on the underlying class structure
and conversion via as.numeric. In theory, the methods won't change or
any changes will be documented, whereas class implementations are
allowed to be fluid and undocumented at the R user level (e.g. the
Help system) afaik. In this case, I don't think that would happen, so
I am merely being pedantic, but I hope I do not offend by making the
point.

But I also wanted to say that the OP could have (imo) looked up the
methodology as I describe below, rather than post here. Or perhaps he
did, but got stymied because he did not know about rle(), a somewhat
esoteric base R function. In which case, the search query "how to find
runs of identical values in an R vector" immediately yielded a hit on
rle(). So my message is: **DO** first try to use R's internal Help
before posting, especially for base R related tasks: it is really a
superb resource (again imo). *

OK, enough sermonizing. Here's what I did. Since the data are POSIXct
class, I went to ?POSIXct and browsed through it until I found
"difftime for time intervals" in the *See Also* section. Following
that link to ?difftime showed me this was what was needed, which is:

difftime(mydf[-1,1], mydf[-nrow(mydf), 1], units = "days")
Time differences in days
[1] 1 1 6 8

Cheers,
Bert

*... and I think it is likely that there are time series related
packages that also could be used, perhaps more immediately, to do what
was requested. But that would require a more diligent search. Though
with new LLM's and generative AI for Help systems becoming available,
the degree of diligence required is rapidly decreasing.

It is best to use Date, rather than POSIXct, class if there are no times.

Use the cumsum expression shown to group the dates and then summarize
each group.

We assume that the dates are already sorted in ascending order.

  library(dplyr)

  mydf <- data.frame(date = as.Date(c("2012-02-05", "2012-02-06",
"2012-02-07", "2012-02-13", "2012-02-21")))

  mydf %>%
    group_by(grp = cumsum(c(0, diff(date)) > 1)) %>%
    summarize(start = first(date), end = last(date)) %>%
    ungroup %>%
    select(-grp)
  ## # A tibble: 3 ? 2
