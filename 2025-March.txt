Subject: [R] expression in lattice panel strip
Message-ID: <IA1P223MB04997BF88B4F3ECDFB5FA8ECFACE2@IA1P223MB0499.NAMP223.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Is it possible to include expression in lattice panel strip?
Thanks,
Naresh

cs <- 2 * cos(2 * pi * (1:500) / 50 + 0.6 * pi)
w <- rnorm(500)
xyplot(ts(cbind(x1 = cs, x2 = cs + w)), screens = list(x1 = expression(2 * cos(2 * pi * t / 50 + 0.6 * pi)), x2 = expression(2 * cos(2 * pi * t / 50 + 0.6 * pi) + N(0, 1))), type = c("l", "g"), main = expression(2 * cos(2 * pi * t / 50 + 0.6 * pi)))

# Greek letter pi is shown in main title, but not in panel strips

Full disclosure: I have never plotted time series using this xyplot method.

However, ?xyplot.ts says:

"screens

factor (or coerced to factor) whose levels specify which panel each
series is to be plotted in. screens = c(1, 2, 1) would plot series 1,
2 and 3 in panels 1, 2 and 1. May also be a named list, see Details
below."

>From that I would infer the answer to your query in no: factors, know
nothing about plotmath notation, and as.factor() just coerces your
expressions to character strings that are the factor labels.
strip.default() then uses these character strings as the labels for
the strips, giving what you got.

As you only want to use a "pi" character, ?, in your math expression,
I tried using a UTF-8 symbol for it, \U1D6D1, in quoted strings as the
argument for the screens parameter. That is:

striplabs <- factor(c("2cos(2\U1D6D1t/50 + 0.6\U1D6D1)",
                      "2cos(2\U1D6D1t /50 + 0.6\U1D6D1) + N(0, 1)"))
xyplot(ts(cbind(x1 = cs, x2 = cs + w)),
       type = c("l", "g"),
       main = expression(2 * cos(2 * pi * t / 50 + 0.6 * pi)),
       screens = striplabs
)

The RStudio graphics device was *not* able to interpret the UTF-8 in
the strip, but on my Mac, the Cairo_pdf() device (or just using the
export button to export the graphic as a pdf from RStudio) *did*
reproduce the characters nicely in the strip labels in the pdf.
Unfortunately, the main title expression symbol for pi (presumably
from the adobe font symbols) did not look nice. However, using the
quoted graphics string (the first level of the striplabs factor) does
fine, of course.

As I just sort of barely know what I'm doing here, there may be a much
better way to do this by using an appropriate font specification in a
strip = strip.custom(par.strip.text= ...) argument to xyplot, but that
exceeds my current abilities. Maybe you or one of the R cognescenti
can figure it  out.

Again, please note my full disclosure.

Cheers,
Bert
