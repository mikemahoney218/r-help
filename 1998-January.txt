Subject: R-beta: NextMethod(.Generic) bug
Message-ID: <199801030120.BAA01225@ripple.atd.ucar.edu>


I'm a day-old R newbie (but a war-weary S veteran), with couple of
first-day questions: 

In R 0.61, this code fails.


	Ops.test <- function(e1,e2)
	{
  	  e1 <- NextMethod(.Generic)
  	  e1
	}

	x <- 4
	class(x) <- "test"
	y <- x < 3
	
The error message is "Error in NextMethod(.Generic) : negative length vectors 
are not allowed.".

I assume it is a bug.  It works in Splus 3.4.  Is there a fix/workaround?

Also, why doesn't the "!" operator work on numeric values?

Thanks a bunch to all you R developers!  I was very pleased to find R,
mainly because I want an "S" which runs on intel Unix.

It is a bug.  When NextMethod looks to see where it has got to in the
class list it uses .Generic instead of .Group even for group methods.  It
can't find ">.test" and runs off the end of the list.  I have a patch for
objects.c in R0.61 that fixes this problem and is probably safe (I have
tested it on the survival4 examples file, which exercises the
object-oriented features quite a bit). It's at the bottom of this message. 

However, another problem with group methods shows up, which is that R will
always use any function method ahead of any group method. If you define
"Ops.foo", "Ops.baz" and ">.bar" and x has class c("foo","bar","baz") then
x+3 goes to "Ops.foo" then "Ops.baz" as it should, but x>2 goes to ">.bar"
and then to the default method. 

> Also, why doesn't the "!" operator work on numeric values?

There are a number of deliberate incompatibilities that fall under the
general heading of "idiot-proofing".  The feeling was that R should try
harder to convert programming errors into syntax errors. The use of ! on
numeric vectors was one of the  more controversial changes, but it is an
easy editing change and doesn't adversely affect non-programmers.

- and probably simple enough to go in 0.61.1.

        I have been informed that there is a public domain software called
"R" which is available through  ftp://stat.auckland.ac.nz. I've tried the
address but I can't find the software itself. Can you help me on this. Thanks.

There is a network of ftp and web pages that have R.
        ftp://ftp.ci.tuwien.ac.at/pub/R                        (Austria)
        http://www.stat.unipg.it/pub/stat/statlib/R/CRAN        (Italy)
        ftp://ftp.u-aizu.ac.jp/pub/lang/R/CRAN                  (Japan)
        http://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/CRAN                 (Switzerland)
        http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN                          (U.S.A.)
        ftp://franz.stat.wisc.edu/pub/R                         (U.S.A.)
        ftp://ftp.biostat.washington.edu/mirrors/R/CRAN         (U.S.A.)

Try one of these, rather than Auckland.

R is not public domain, but it is freely useable and freely distributable,
which is probably what you meant.

I'm also having some trouble with R on NT (I'm using NT 4.0 SP3).

The rsept.exe from rseptbeta.zip, which presents itself as "Version 0.50
Beta (Sept 29, 1997)", although the file time stamp indicates Oct 2, 1997,
15:08 - and file size is 918 528, by the way, runs OK, from command line,
Windows Explorer or from shortcut, except for the memory problem you
mentioned - either with the menu or with DOS command Rsept -v n. In fact,
menu dialogue is not closed either by OK or cancel button, the only way to
close it is the Windows close window command button.

However, the rsept.exe from exe.zip, which is newer, starts for a very
short instant (the time to see the screen flashing), and then silently dies.

I don't get any error messages.

Try www.stat.cmu.edu/R/.

But I have not managed to retrieve the documentation yet. I need to know
how R differs from S. When I open R I am asked to type "licence" on the
first promt, but when I do so, R replies: Error: couldn't find function
"licence"

???? 

Could    r-help  help me with this?

Yup. Try spelling it correctly...

However, it won't tell you much. Read the R FAQ instead, the address
is in the footer of every post on R-help.

Why must it be American English only?
I should be easy to implement both a British and an American version.

Subject: R-beta: Dec alpha
Message-ID: <l03010d02b0d7dd0d1f9e@[139.222.80.154]>

R ran find on our Sun until it was stolen. I have now set up R on one of
our Dec Alphas OSF1 V4.0 386.  R-0.49 configures builds and runs fine
except that the glm command crashes R.  R-0.60.1  configures builds and
runs until a cis entered.  I think the problem is the floating point
conventions but before I get in over my head a question
Has anyone used glm successfully on Alphas OSF1 V4.0 386?
Thanks

Hmm. There was a bug that crashed SGI's in a similar way. It will get
fixed in 0.61.1, but meanwhile find the line in src/main/scan.c that
says

static char  ConsoleBufCnt;

and change char to int. 


This is just a guess, there are many places where a 64-bit machine may
run into untested conditions because most of the developer machines
are 32 bit.

If it doesn't help, get back to us with a sample of the crash output
and, if you can, run it under a debugger and see exactly where it
crashes.

Message-ID: <199801061805.SAA16767@ripple.atd.ucar.edu>



Thanks to Thomas Lumley for the very quick fix of the NextMethod(.Generic)
bug.  The patch enclosed in his message to r-help fixed that problem
nicely. 

But..., I've got another one.

	x <- 1:4
	attr(x,"foo") <- "bar"	
	attributes(x < 4)

returns NULL.

The "foo" attribute has been lost in the "x < 4" operation.
The blue book says that the result of binary operations should have
the attributes of the longer operand.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.3.93.980107085305.13908A-100000@alpha2-stat.sci.uni-klu.ac.at>


The R version of the spatial library from 

  Venables W.N., Ripley, B.D. (1997):
  Modern applied statistics with S-PLUS, Springer
  (second edition)

is now available at CRAN. (spatial_VR5-2.tar.gz)

It is based on the latest Version (Dec 1997) of VR5.tar.gz available at 
http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Sbook/

This port supports the same range of functionality as the original S version,
that means, it contains both the kriging and the point pattern analysis code.

It will only compile (and run) with R version 0.61 and later.

I tested it successfully with R 0.61 on a linux machine.

This sounds like CPU overheating more than anything else (fan still
running?). Note that in contrast to certain other OS's, Linux doesn't
run a busy wait loop when the system is idle, so CPU-intensive tasks
result in an abrupt rise in temperature. Linux should protect
application programs from crashing other parts of the system, so this
is hardly a fault in R.

Hello R-helpers,
I was wondering if  anyone is porting S lib packages for design of experiments:
conf.design, glim, graff(all from statlib)? I was able to change the format of S
packages into R (including docs). In conf.design, by W. Venables, sort.list
function is missing from R. I just put sort.list <- sort, but I got more error
messages.  Before doing more work, would like to know if this already done?

I don't know anything ported yet from 'DOE'
	(What I would like most is a port of the S / S-plus  BUILTIN
	 DOE functions such as
		design(), fac.design(), fractionate(), the  oa.* functions,
		etc....
	)

I don't know if 'glim' is valuable since we have glm(.).

You should use
	sort.list <- order 
rather than sort

Yep, this helped! I also  changed the factorize function so that "out of bounds"
error does not happen. It seems to work.

But, since I basically automated my performance monitoring job here at

Does anybody have R binaries that I can borrow for a while ??

@PERL@ means that whoever created the RPM forgot to replace it with
the actual location of perl (forgot to add some file to configure.in)...

I'd try installing it with rpm -i --nodeps (or --force, I forget).

helpful to be  able to see what is in the directory.  

I guess  I will have to go through the list off functions in thee Blue book and 
see what is there   and what is not. And how do I enter functions that are not 
there. 

Any lead on how to proceed from here is greatly appreciated.

I am running R 0.61.0 on a Sparc 5, Solaris 2.4, in tcsh. Today I
couldn't, to my big surprise, scan a data file in R. As I finally
understood it, R wanted a decimal comma instead of a decimal point,
because LANG was set to 'sv'. See my runs below. I wonder why this 
happens now for the first time, I have had LANG set to sv for many
years. 'unsetenv LANG' made things turn back to normal again, so I 
guess that I have to remove a certain line from my .login file.

This is fair enough, but it seems as if no arithmetic whatsoever
can be done when LANG = sv. With decimal point calculations are wrong
(decimals in arguments get discarded), with decimal comma I get syntax
error.

Can someone tell me what is going on? If it is supposed to be a 
feature in R to recognize LANG, something seems to be wrong.

I have now installed ESS-mode successfully on my SPARC-20 Workstation running S-Plus 3.4. I 
then tried it on my Laptop running Linux 2.0, Xemacs 19-14 and R-0.61.

When I try to invoke R from xemacs I get the following responses:

R runs correct from the shell and is installed as /usr/local/bin/R

What might be wrong?

Apparently, the strtod() C library function accepts different formats
depending on locale settings, so probably the setlocale(LC_ALL,""); in
src/main/main.c is doing you in. 

This is the same thing that allows you to have a variable called
"f?r?ldre" and see come out right on plots, etc., so you don't want to
remove that line. 

I think that either you should setenv LC_NUMERIC to C or POSIX or R
should only set LC_CTYPE (and maybe some of the others?).

Yes, the combination (LANG = sv & LC_NUMERIC = C) seems to work properly.

I'm not cpmpletely sure, but I think min(z) will be the first color

equally spaced in between.

I was the person who created that rpm file but I did so by converting
a Debian linux .deb file.  Apparently the rpm program performs checks
that are not done (or perhaps not needed) when installing a .deb file.

Those dependencies are spurious.  The references to @PERL@ were caused 
by my forgetting to remove the .in versions of scripts such as
$RHOME/etc/Rdconv. 

I have a new version of the .deb package without those problematic
files.  There was also a problem with one script that had an explicit
dependence on /usr/local/bin/perl.  I believe that should be fixed in
the 0.61.1 release of R.

For the time being I think it should work to use --nodeps.  Please let 
me know if you have difficulties.

I have difficulty testing the .rpm files because I am not running
RedHat Linux.  Is there anyone running RedHat 5.0 who would be willing 
to test an installation for me?  I can generate the RedHat 5.0
packages much easier than I can generate the RedHat 4.2 package.

I'm just in the process of hooking in to R 0.61 and most of the memory 
problems that have been noticed should disappear at that point.

PicTex is extremely low on my list of things to get going (you could
convince me otherwise though).

R developers,

Attributes are lost in binary operations.

R Version 0.61.0 Alpha (December 21, 1997)

Example:

	x <- 1:4
	attr(x,"foo") <- "bar"	
	attributes(x < 4)

returns NULL.

The "foo" attribute has been lost in the "x < 4" operation.
The blue book says that the result of binary operations should have
the attributes of the longer operand.

Thanks for R!

Yes, without much of the trouble. I've compiled it on AIX 4.2.1 IBM RISC/6000,
and under AIX 4.2.1 on IBM PowerPC. The compiler I've used was the latest gcc. I
 found some problems compiling with xlc. I've not resolved the problem of 
dymanic loadig yet for some modules, even though it should be doable since 
AIX 4.2.1 allows for the dynamic loading. The R itself runs OK.

I have fixed most (all I think) of the reported problems with split.
There should be a patch release this Sunday and the fixes will be in it
if anyone wants/needs them sooner please let me know and I'll pass them
along directly. Now I just need to change the documentation.....

I also fixed the problem with seq reported by Martin,
 On line 85 of seq.c change the i to a j.

  v2 = strlen(CHAR(STRING(levs2)[i]));
  
 should read
  v2 = strlen(CHAR(STRING(levs2)[j]));
  
  this will also be in the patches.

I am using R-0.50-a4  on linux. When I try this I get:
image(x, y, volcano,col=gray(1:32/32),xlab="X", ylab="Y")
Error: formal argument "xlab" matched by multiple actual arguments

(Using volcano data as in help page.) What am I doing wrong?

Thanks very much for any help.

	I am using R-0.50-a4  on linux. When I try this I get:

	Error: formal argument "xlab" matched by multiple actual arguments

I'm not sure what the problem is (I don't have a R-0.50-a4 handy),
but here is a quick work around.

After you have created the image plot, you can use use the function
"title" to add annotation to a plot.

	image( ... )
	title(xlab="xlab here", ylab="ylab here")

Using R-0.50-a4.... This has been fixed long since. If you're lazy,
edit the image function.

It now looks like this:

> image
function (x = seq(0, 1, len = nrow(z)), y = seq(0, 1, len = ncol(z)), 
        z, zlim = range(z, na.rm = TRUE), col = heat.colors(12), 
        add = FALSE, xaxs = "i", yaxs = "i", xlab, ylab, ...) 
{
        if (missing(xlab)) 
                xlab <- if (missing(x)) 
                        ""
                else deparse(substitute(x))
        if (missing(ylab)) 
                ylab <- if (missing(y)) 
                        ""
                else deparse(substitute(y))
        if (!add) 
                plot(0, 0, xlim = range(x, na.rm = TRUE), ylim = range(y, 
                        na.rm = TRUE), type = "n", xaxs = xaxs, 
                        yaxs = yaxs, xlab = xlab, ylab = ylab, 
                        ...)
        .Internal(image(as.double(x), as.double(y), as.double(z), 
                as.double(zlim), col))
}

  The problem is that R-0.50-a4 has a simplified (mildly buggy) version of
image():

> image
function (x = seq(0, 1, len = nrow(z)), y = seq(0, 1, len = ncol(z)), 
        z, zlim = range(z, na.rm = TRUE), col = heat.colors(12), 
        ...) 
{
        plot(0, 0, xlim = range(x, na.rm = TRUE), ylim = range(y, 
                na.rm = TRUE), type = "n", xaxs = "i", yaxs = "i", 
                xlab = "", ylab = "", ...)
        .Internal(image(as.double(x), as.double(y), as.double(z), 
                as.double(zlim), col))

 --  which doesn't do the right thing with xlab and ylab.
  It appears fixed in 0.60, which is what I have: the workaround should be
fine.

Subject: R-beta: New version 0.61.1
Message-ID: <x2oh1jc60k.fsf@blueberry.kubism.ku.dk>


The R core team proudly presents:

       \||||||||/
       -R 0.61.1-
       /||||||||\


I've just rolled together a new patch release.

It's available from the Auckland repository now, but please do not get
it from there unless you are in a terrible hurry. It should find its
way to the main CRAN site in Vienna this evening and then to the rest
of the CRAN sites. 

There's also a patch file, R-0.61-0.61.1.diff.gz, which you can apply
to an existing R-0.61 tree. Note that the proper patch procedure is as
follows -- assuming that your current working directory is the top
directory of R-0.61 and the patch file is in the parent directory.

gzip -dc ../R-0.61-0.61.1.diff.gz | patch -E -p1

or on most installations, equivalently

zcat ../R-0.61-0.61.1.diff.gz | patch -E -p1

The above requires that you have GNU "patch" installed. At least one
system (Solaris) ships with a different "patch", which exhibits some
annoying bits of braindamage. If you want to use it, you're on your
own...

I removed changes to the file src/main/gram.c from the patchfile,
because they amounted almost two thirds of the patchfile and the file
is automatically generated from src/main/gram.y anyway. 

A few systems may not have a parser generator installed, and for the
benefit of those, I've also put up a R-0.61-0.61.1.diff.w.gram.c.gz
file. Note that you may need a "touch src/main/gram.c" to prevent
"make" from trying to rebuild it.

Here's the list of changes relative to 0.61 (from the CHANGES file):

                CHANGES IN R VERSION 0.61.1

NEW FEATURES

    o   None (by definition, x.y.z releases are bugfix releases now)

BUG FIXES

    o   Return statements of the form return(x,y) will now return
        a list with named components.

    o   Parsing of nested "if" statments was broken.  This is fixed now.
        (Reported by Paul Gilbert).

    o   Wrong declaration of ConsoleBufCnt in src/main/scan.c caused crash
        in Irix (George White <gwhite at bodnext.bio.dfo.ca>)

    o   if(nmatch = 0) bug in src/main/character.c fixed (Doug Bates)

    o   R_alloc/S_alloc fixes. The former allocated 4 times more than
        needed, the latter zeroed half of what it got, sizeof() mistakes
        in both cases.

    o   c(ordered factor) caused segfault (uninitalised pointer), now
        fixed.

    o   behaviour of as.numeric() on factors changed recently; now
        documented.

    o   model.matrix() now pays attention to the names on its dataframe
        argument.

    o   Fixes to group methods.

    o   autoload() caused infinite loop if function  wasn't found in
        library on loading

    o   The pager ate the rest of stdin in batch mode, now fixed. Also,
        stdout was not flushed before call to system(). "make tests"
        should work now.

    o   Empty directories now created by configure (so that it doesn't
        matter that "CVS export" doesn't do it)

    o   as.name() made idempotent (i.e. if is.name(x) then as.name(x)==x)

    o   3 problems with glm, 2 in glm.fit and a one in print.glm fixed
        [Jim Lindsey]

    o   binomial (family) now works when 'n=0'. [J.Lindsey]

    o   split() now also works in split(1:10,1:2)

    o   strsplit() now also works for strsplit(c,NULL)

    o   A LANG='..' environment variable no longer affects  scan()ing of
        numbers.

    o   seq(.) doesn't segfault anymore in  gl(2,3):gl(1,6)

    o   contour(.) now also works with integer arguments

Subject: R-beta: first view, then save plot or image?
Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.3.95.980112113142.7580A-100000@io.uwinnipeg.ca>

I know how to first set postscript output, then execute plot or image
command to create a postscript file of a plot or image.

I was wondering if it is possible to first create the plot or image on
screen so it can be viewed, THEN save it to file?  Without doing plot() or
image() again?

(I ask because I have a complicated image computation that takes about 1-2
hrs to complete.  I would like to view, then save it to file if I like it)

Along a similar vein, is it possible to alter an image after it has been
plotted on screen?  That is, first create image, then decide I want a
different palette of colours, then alter it.  Again, is it possible to do
without re-executing image()? (In my case, without waiting another 1-2hrs)

Thanks very much for any help!

I think you'll be happy a few split seconds after typing
?save.plot
(and ?print.plot)

Sorry, no. Some of the external PostScript manipulators *might* be able
to do this.

There are save.plot() and print.plot() commands for the x11() driver that
save to a PostScript file. They are still a bit slow as they repeat the
primitive graphics operations that created the picture. This is
unavoidable if you want reasonable quality, since the screen image only
exists in 75dpi.

No.  Currently even resizing the window causes the image to vanish. It's
not really stored anywhere (except as a bitmap). 


(why does image() take so long? I've never had it take more than a couple
of minutes. If it the computation that is slow you could store the results
and redraw as often as you like)

Thanks very much Peter and Thomas!

As for why it takes so long, Thomas, it is not image() that is to blame
but the computation of the z-value ("2D cross-intensity function"
for two point processes [1000 pts in each]). Yes I had thought about
saving just the z-values.

Paul Murrell who is just finising up a PhD here has done a lot of
working extending R graphics capabilities.  If I can resist pestering
him for "just that little bit more" we should the work integrated
into R in the next couple of weeks.

These changes will see:

    o	Multiple active devices (eg several X11 windows on screen)
	and the ability to copy between devices.  This will make
	it possible to take snapshots of on-screen graphics
	(using the dev.print() function).

    o	An an "xfig" device driver which will produce plots
	which can be edited by the xfig drawing program.

    o	More flexible layout capabilities.

That said, if your images are as complex as you say the changes above
won't help that much.  I would suggest that you initially decimate your
image and play will color selection on that reduced image before
drawing the final version.

I naively thought I could add x and y axis labels onto a contour plot (as
in image).  I can't.  I realize I can use the workaround Ross posted in
answer to my previous post about image().  I just thought I would mention
it here in case contour was "supposed" to be able to work as image does
with axis labels.

Hmmm.  Bug or feature?

Note that as you've written it, this does not parse in S either.
However,
	{ if (xxx)  yyyy;else zzzz }
does.

It works in S because the parser converts ";" immediately into "\n"
and within "{ ... }" a newline preceding preceding an "else" is not
significant.

There is a side-effect problem in S which comes out of this quick-fix.
E.g (in S)
	> 1;2
	[1] 1
	> [1] 2
	> 
Note the extra prompt printed before the second value.

It might be possible to "unfix" this in R, but it's not trivial.

I'd suggest that you make a quick pass through the code removing any
";"s which occur at the end of lines and converting any ";"
immediately before an "else" into a space (or newline).

I have the following problem. I have some multidimensional data points
"x" and a curve "fit" fitted to these points. How can I combine
R> pairs(x)
and
R> pairs(fit,panel=lines)
in one plot, so that I can see how good the curve fits the data?

A command like
R> pairs(x, panel=function(x,y) {points(x,y); lines(lowess(x,y))})
does not work, since I fit the curve in all dimensions at once.

Thanks,

I've seen this demonstrated using the program `pstoedit' to generate
`xfig'-code from the R-generated PostScript.  Thereafter you can use
`xfig' to alter the figure and convert back to PostScript.  The
process is kinda involving, though.

Actually, R is consistent with version 3.3 of S-Plus, if I'm not
mistaken.  The above construct with ";" before the "else" would give
parse error in S-Plus 3.3, but _not_ in S-Plus 3.1.  So I really feel
that R is doing the right thing here.

You can write

fit<-compute.fit.somehow()
pairs(x, fitted.lines=fit, 
	panel=function(x,y,fitted.lines){
		points(x,y)
		however.you.display.lines(fitted.lines,x,y)
		}
	)

that is, pass the fit as an extra argument into pairs(). In R but not in S
you could even use the fit without passing it in

fit<-compute.fit.somehow()
pairs(x, 
        panel=function(x,y){
                points(x,y)
                however.you.display.lines(fit,x,y)
                }
        )

This would only work in S if it were called from the top-level prompt --
inside a function it would fail mysteriously.

Thanks, but it does not work in this way. If I try it with the standard
lines command, I get
Error: x and y lengths differ

The reason is that x and fit are two matrices of the same size (100x4
for example). For each pair of columns of x, the pairs function passes
these two column vectors (length 100) and the whole fit matrix (length
400) to the function defined in panel. I see no way to rewrite the
panel function in a way that I can extract the appropriate columns of
fit.

Passed on your suggestions I came up with the following possibilty:

R> dim(x)
[1] 100   4
R> dim(fit)
[1] 100   4
R> xfit <-matrix(0,200,4); xfit[1:100,] <- x; xfit[101:200,] <- fit
R> pairs(xfit, panel=function(x,y){
         n <- length(x)/2
         points(x[1:n],y[1:n])
         lines(x[(n+1):(2*n)],y[(n+1):(2*n)])})

But this is rather complicated. I think the only clean way for this
and related problems would be a parameter "new" which can be passed to
the pairs command (or any other plot command). Something like
R> pairs(x)
R> pairs(fit, panel=lines, new=F)

Hi,
 again messing with Hmisc I came across an error in summary.formula
function. It fails on the line : eval(X, sys.frame(sys.parent())).

....
Browse[1]> X
model.frame(formula = iris$Sepal.Width ~ iris$Sepal.Length, data = iris, 
        na.action = function (mf) 
        mf)

Error: 2 arguments passed to ".Internal" which requires 1.

???
Any ideas ?

I am using a DEC alpha 200/4/233 with Digital Unix 3.2D
My previous version of R was R-0.50-a1. I have installed around 3 or 4
previous versions on the same system and never had a problem (but, then
the Makefile was very different). The first make to compile everything
went OK as usual. I have  a standard installation of perl 5 (accepting
all defaults in configure). 

Any ideas?

No, but I can report exactly the same failure yesterday on a
Sparc running SunOS4.1.3. Worked fine on Solaris2.4, though.

This is a known install bug (and will hopefully be fixed very
soon). The problem is not perl but your version of make ... installing
docs works only with GNU make (not DEC make), so if GNU make is
installed on your system (it might be called gmake), use this.

Fritz

gnu make does not work for me either:

Um, actually, that doesn't work either, because the top level Makefile
calls "make"... If you have gmake, do what the makefile tries to do
but run with gmake instead. Or (and if you don't have gmake around,
you'll have to) substitute the *expansion* of the wildcarded
expression in the definition of MANSRC.

That could be a path problem. Try

PATH=/opt/gnu/gnubin:$PATH make

(or whatever the csh equivalent is...)

  Would it make sense to add something to configure that looks for gnu 
make and sets MAKE=gnu make if it's available?  (This might forestall this

It would make sense, but it would make even more sense not to require GNU
make, so we plan to do that instead.

Subject: R-beta: DSE time series package
Message-ID: <98Jan16.115834est.13454@mailgate.bank-banque-canada.ca>

===============================================================

                     ANNOUNCEMENT

===============================================================

An R version of my multivariate time series package (DSE) is now available at
CRAN/src/contrib/devel/dse.v.98.1alphaR.tar.gz and it should be reflected
at the mirrors shortly. The User's Guide is available at

  http://www.bank-banque-canada.ca/pgilbert

HTML help documentation is distributed with the code and is also available
at the above web site. (The web page is a bit out of date but I hope to fix
that soon.)

The tar file includes two other packages which may be of interest by themselves.

The first, called syskern, provides a kernel of functions for S/R programmers
which is intended to help write code which is independent of operating system
differences and some small differences between S and R.
The second, called tframe, provides a kernel of functions for programming time
series methods relatively independently of the representation of time.
This is intended to make it easier to write code which can use any new/better
time representations when they appear. It also provides plotting, windowing,
and some other utility functions which are specifically intended for time
series.

The DSE library implements an object oriented approach to time series
models (using classes and methods in R/S). This means that different
model representations can be implemented with fairly simple extensions
to the library. The original library included multi-variate state space
and ARMA (including VAR) models. The current version implements Troll
models as another class. These are run by completely separate software
(Troll from Intex Inc.) as if they were an integral part of the
library. Models and data are passed back and forth to Troll and the
results can be analyzed with already existing functions in the
library.  This also serves as an example for including other classes
and methods. [The Troll interface is not yet functional in R.]

Methods for simulating, estimating, and converting among different
model representations form the basic part of the library. Methods for
studying estimation methods and for examining the forecasting properties
of models are also documented in the User Guide.

Relative to commercial packages the library is especially useful for
time series research (such as studying estimation methods) and for
teaching. For usual time series applications there may be commercial
packages which are preferable.

A list server for questions and discussion of problems has also been set up.

To subscribe to the list send a message to
with a line in the body:

Subsequent message submissions to the list should be sent to
boc_dse at bank-banque-canada.ca


Caveats for R

I have tested the package with R0.61.1 in Solaris and R0.61 in Linux. I would
appreciate feedback about other OSs. The install procedures are currently Unix
specific (I believe) but if anyone attempts installing in Windows I would be
especially interested in knowing how to do this.

The package has been put in the devel area of CRAN because there are still
some things I would like to fix (although it is mostly working well), and
because the documentation has not been revised. I would appreciate any early
feedback as I would like to fix as many problems as possible before moving
this out of the devel category.

The package is divided into several parts, some logical and some because
the current version of R does not support large libraries.

Beware that some documentation in the code, in the HTML based help system,
and in the Brief Users' Guide is still somewhat specific to S and is not
correct for R (particularly with respect to installation). See the READ.ME
file for instruction to install in R.

Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.3.95.980116114842.27739A-100000@io.uwinnipeg.ca>

I have a collection of functions in a file kernel.r and right now I just
source the file in when I want to use those functions.  I was wondering if
it would make sense to turn kernel.r into a package.  If so, what is the
advantage over sourcing it in?  I couldn't find detailed info in the docs
(Venables's tutorial or in the R help--I looked up library()) for creating
a package.

Thanks very much for any help.

If you are actually working on the code you may find sourcing is more convenient
than a package/library. Once the code is stable then putting it in a library has
a few advantages, especially if there are a large number of functions and others
are using them too:

 - ls() doesn't show functions in the library (so it is easier to see the stuff
you are working on.

-You shouldn't get multiple copies of the library functions in your .Rdata
files.

-If you fix something in the library then it is fixed wherever you or anyone
else uses it. If you are sourcing it then you have not fixed copies saved in
.RData files. [ Note: If you break something in the library then it is broken
wherever you or anyone else uses it.]

Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.3.95.980116152728.6063A-100000@io.uwinnipeg.ca>

I am running  R-0.61.1 on linux under X. If I kill the R Graphics window
(click on X box in upper right corner), then subsequently do x11(),
R crashes.

I find that things only work the right way if I close the graphics window
using dev.off().

I was wondering if maybe it could be arranged that closing the graphics
window via click would seem to R to be equivalent to typing dev.off().

BTW thanks very much for the replies on packages/libraries.

I wouldn't think so, but the X calls should probably be fixed to do
the necessary cleaning up when the window has disappeared. Dying of a
SIGPIPE is certainly not elegant...

However, there's some extensive graphics changes coming up in 0.62, so
it's hardly worth it to try and fix it in the 0.61 series. Till then:
Just don't do that!....

Subject: R-beta: command-line editing not working in Debian Linux version
Message-ID: <m0xtfS7-0003JEC@rabbit.dynamic-ppp-has-no-domain>

I get great flexibility with command-line editing through the "readline" 
library in the "bash" editor and the "ncftp" tool.  S-Plus has this editing 
and I see in the preliminary "Notes on R: A Programming Environment for Data 
Analysis and Graphics", page 65, that "R -e" might give this functionality.  
Typically, one can use either vi or emacs commands to go back through previous 
commands and edit the current command line.

I notice that the readline library is not compiled into the Debian Linux 
R.binary (ldd R.binary).  Perhaps this was an oversight, or perhaps 
command-line editing has yet to be added.

I notice that for vi editing style one ought to set (in "bash" shell)
     export S_CLEDITOR=vi
however, hopefully, the readline [not the S/R readline() function, but the 
readline library] file ~/.inputrc parameters would work to set "vi" mode and 
other readline parameters (if the readline library gives this command line 
functionality in R, that is).

Which version of the Debian Linux package are you using?  The 0.61.1-2
version for Debian-2.0 was accidently compiled without readline
support.  I will compile and upload a new version.

As far as I can see, the Debian-1.3 versions should have readline
support.  Please tell me if that doesn't work.

If you are an emacs user, you should consider using ESS (Emacs Speaks
Statistics) instead.  This emacs mode allows you to run R under emacs
and provides more powerful editing and command recall than does using
readline.

The package is available as

We just found the magic X incantation to handle the window closing
problem.  Closing a graphics window using the window manager (e.g. by
clicking the close box or with a menu selection) will be equivalent to
using dev.off() on the underlying device.

As Peter says, there will be some major changes in 0.62 which will see
a big improvement in the graphics system.

Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.3.93.980119135100.9932A-100000@alpha2-stat.sci.uni-klu.ac.at>


Would it be possible to include a new command in the ${RHOME}/etc path, which
updates the Library index (Rd and html) via  "R LIBINDEX".

I need it because I use RPM to manage three different R installations (at home,
at the institute and in the seminar rooms). I put all libraries into several
packages, so it is easy for me to update a single library at all these
different places. 

But after installation or removal of a library via rpm the help indices have to
be updated.  A call like "R INSTALL +help" in the post/pre install/uninstall
script calls also "make" in the library source trees, which is unnecessary (and
may even fail, e.g. because of a missing Fortran compiler). 

The following script does exactly what I want (I don't know if it will work
for library directories other then $RHOME/library):

It would also be good, if some of the compile options could be overridden in
a "R INSTALL ..." call. Especially I'm using GNU Fortran when compiling the base
R disribution, that means $src is set to "src". But g77 fails on some of the
libraries. So I want to do "R INSTALL +docs src-c libname" for this library
which sets $dir to "src-c".

I would propose the following patch to includes these two options
("src" or "src-c") into "R INSTALL":

I'm not sure if the facility is available in RPM but the Debian
packages for R include "post-install", "pre-remove", and "post-remove"
scripts (thanks to Kurt Hornig).  They are similar to your script
above

 #!/bin/sh
 #
 # postinst script for the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran package
 # This version written by Douglas Bates <bates at stat.wisc.edu>

 set -e

 case "$1" in
     configure)     
       (cd /usr/lib/R/library; cat */TITLE > LibIndex; ../etc/build-htmlpkglist)
	 #
	;;
     abort-upgrade|abort-remove|abort-deconfigure)
	 ;;
     *)
	 echo "postinst called with unknown argument \`$1'" >&2
	 ;;
 esac

If, as you suggest, a LIBINDEX script was created, these could be
shortened.  Can you incorporate this type of code into your RPM packages?

On the topic of Fortran compilers, has anyone attempted a compilation
using eg77.  This is the version of g77 to accompany egcs, the
experimental GNU compiler system.  Now that gcc-2.8.0 is out I guess
that there won't be as much interest in egcc.  I understand though
that a version of g77 to accompany gcc-2.8.0 is still in the works.

 eg77 Description: The EGCS experimental Fortran compiler.
  This is the EGCS experimental version of the g77 Fortran compiler. Like
  the standard FSF release, it uses the gcc backend to generate code.
  It requires the egcc package to be installed in order to work.

Let me first tell you that you and your cohorts are
doing a great service to the statistical community
with R. I have been working with Rseptbeta under
Win95 and I am very impressed with its capabilities.
 
I thought I give you some feedback gained from
my limited playing with R.

=============================================================
When loading the Survival package, which is
not yet supposed to work, it seems that glm
does not work either. Without Survival glm
seems to work. I am not sure whether this
gives a clue concerning the problems with Survival.
 
One interesting application is to Weibull data
which is only observed at single inspection
points T_1, ..., T_n, not all the same and
contained in insp.times. The only thing that is
known about the actual lifetimes X_1, ..., X_n
is whether X_i < T_i or not, giving me the 0,1
vector status. One can then get the mle's of the
Weibull scale (alpha) and shape (beta) parameters
by using
 
dat <- data.frame(status=status,insp.times=insp.times)
out <- glm(status ~ log(insp.times),
family=binomial(link=cloglog),data=dat).
 
Then alpha <- exp(-out$coef[1]/out$coef[2]) and
beta <- out$coef[2] will do it.
 
I don't know whether this example usage is known
in this form?
 
 
=============================================================
The fix function seems to work on an existing
object although I did not see it documented.
However, a few times after repeated use of
fix I was unable to write to a file on trying
to exit. The only way out was to stop R without
the ability to save the workspace. Can't quite
make this reproducible yet, but it has happened
a few times.
 
=============================================================
In glm the offset does not seem to work.
When I generate data like
 
n <- 100
beta <- 2
x <- 5*(0:n)/n
y <- x+beta*x+rnorm(n)
dat <- data.frame(y=y,x=x)
out1_glm.fit(x,y,family=gaussian(),offset=x,intercept=FALSE)
out2_glm(y~x-1,family=gaussian,offset=x,data=dat)
out_c(out1$coef,out2$coef)
 
then out contains two numbers differing by 1, indicating
that glm.fit seems to work and glm does not
honor the offset.
 
I was trying to implement the Weibull estimation routines
as described in Chapter 13 of Gen. Lin. Models 2nd ed
by McCullagh and Nelder, and that's when I ran into
trouble with offset.
 
=============================================================
 
Data entry
 
It seems that xx <- de() works, whereas xx <- data.entry()
does not, gives me xx=NULL on exit.

I am using image() with col=gray(31:0/31).  These are "reversed" grey
levels where black=biggest z-value. The problem is that the lines with
form a box around the plot are not all these.  Only the bottom and right
sides have lines; the others are missing.

I wonder if this is due to the white cells of my image plot slightly
overlapping with these lines and thereby wiping them out?

I tried adding bty = "o" to image() but it didn't do anything.

Thanks very much for any help.

Subject: R-beta: save.plot()
Message-ID: <34C866EA.3764987@ulg.ac.be>

I currently use R0.61 to produce graphs for use in a tex document.
I first type
  x11(orientation='portrait',width=4,height=3.5)
to fix the size of my graph, produce some plot type commands,
and then save the whole as an .eps file using save.plot().

The graph is included in the tex file using
 \epsffile{file.eps}
in a figure environment.
The problem is that the graph occupies a whole page in the
produced document, whatever the width and height mentioned
in x11().

How can this be avoided? (I don't want to use the command 
postscript because I want to see the graph before saving).

Many thanks in advance,
 Philippe

I have just been told by Jim that a part of my last message was not
clear. 

By saying that the graph occupies a whole page in the
document (produced by TeX) whatever the width and height mentioned,
I just mean that the produced graph (which is sensitive to the 
arguments width and height) seems to be surrounded by a blank
area that prevents TeX to write any text around it whatever the
choice for width and height in X11().

I hope that my question is clearer now.

I have attached an image file created by R.  The image has white
horizontal lines between the cells.  The image looks OK in the R Graphics
window, but has the horiz lines when viewed in Ghostview (after using
save.plot) or when printed out using print.plot.

There appears to be a problem with the image code (maybe this will go away
in the new version). I am running under Linux and am using 61.1.

Thanks very much for any help.

The problem does not occur if you open a postscript device (by using
the command postscript() ) and re-issue all the plot commands. I know
this is quite uncomfortable, but I can tell you that the new graphics
functions in 0.62 (multiple devices simultanously, ...) are really great :-)

Please hold your breath for a few more days (or weeks or ...)

Hi All,

I am a statistical newbie but since my business is systems performance I 
am taking the risky step of being smarter than my boss and applying 
formulae, often translated to perl, to my collected data.

I would be most grateful if you could point me either to 3.6 stuff or 
other sources that might help.  So far I am relying on exceptions from 
threshold triggers, using linear regression and expn smooting for 
forecasting.  These have their problems though, because systems are 
fraught with outliers, and these are actully important.

The hugeness of this type of data and streaming batch requirements (a 
contradiction) preclude any $1K+ packages entering the picture.  Every 
thing has to be written in perl.

Any clues would by most helpful, thanks in advance.

Yours, John van V.

I don't know that I can offer immediate help, but Paul Murrell and
I have nearly finished a complete rewrite of the graphics system which
should help.  The save.plot() and print.plot() commands were just
an interim solution and now we do something better.

This stuff will be in 0.62, which doesn't have a release date yet,
but I hope it will be pretty soon.

Quick Summary:

You start device drivers as a present:

	x11()

but you can have several graphics windows on screen at one time.
When you have an an on-screen picture you like, you can say

	dev.print(file="fig3.eps", height=4, width=5)

(any arguments to "postscript" are acceptable to dev.print).

It will also be possible to resize on-screen graphics windows and have
their contents redrawn to match the new size.  This is not just a
rescaling of the window contents as in Splus, but a complete redrawing
of the picture.

I don't know if libncurses.so.3.4 is available for RedHat.  It may be
another case of version-skew in the numbering of libraries between
RedHat 5.0 and Debian 2.0.

The package you are trying to install was created by me on a Debian
Linux system running the "unstable" version that will become
Debian-2.0.  Like RedHat 5.0 this version is based on libc6.  After
creating a Debian package from sources, one can run it through an
automatic converter to create a RedHat RPM package.  That is how the
RPM file you are trying to install was created.

Earlier we had problems with the numbering of the libreadline.so
library.  The version numbered 2.1 under Debian is numbered 3.0 under
RedHat.  RedHat 5.0 comes with a libncurses.so.3.0.  That library is
also available for Debian but the most recent version of the library
is numbered 3.4.  I don't know what the differences are.  The
ncurses3.4 package in Debian is described as
 Package: ncurses3.4
 Priority: required
 Section: base
 Maintainer: Galen Hazelwood <galenh at micron.net>
 Source: ncurses
 Version: 1.9.9g-7
 Depends: libc6
 Description: Video terminal manipulation - shared libraries
  This package contains the shared libraries necessary to run programs
  compiled with the ncurses libraries.

The copyright file for the package states
 This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the ncurses
 library and terminfo utilities. ncurses/terminfo was written by Pavel
 Curtis and Zeyd M. Ben-Halim <zmbenhal at netcom.com>. Ncurses is
 copyright (C) 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995 by Zeyd M. Ben-Halim.

 Galen Hazelwood <galenh at micron.net> created this package, from sources
 found under ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/zm/zmbenhal/ncurses.  It
 borrows heavily from the original debianization put together by Bruce
 Perens <Bruce at Pixar.com> and benifitted considerably from a lot of
 help from David Engel <david at elo.ods.com>.  Michael Alan Dorman
 <mdorman at debian.org> arranged the beast into its present form, and put
 a lot of effort into making ncurses fit with Debian in the best way
 possible.  His patches for packaging the ill-fated 4.1 release form the
 backbone of this version.  The current maintainer is greatly in debt to
 his illustrious predecessors.

Apparently the original sources are the file
  /ftp at ftp.netcom.com:/pub/zm/zmbenhal/ncurses:
  total 2868
  drwxr-xr-x   2 3245     50           512 Feb 26  1997 .
  drwxr-xr-x   5 3245     1            512 Dec 16 01:11 ..
  ...
  -rw-r--r--   1 3245     50       1081067 Feb 26  1997 ncurses-1.9.9g.tar.gz

I think it is best for me to stop trying to provide RPM packages of R
by converting Debian packages.  We seem to be having too much trouble
keeping library versions consistent.  Others may be willing to
contribute native RPM packages to CRAN.

In the short term I could try to create a .rpm package from the
ncurses3.4 Debian package and you could install that.  I would not
prefer that as a long term solution because I don't know enough about
the libraries to take responsibility for others installing such
packages.

The bottom line seems to be this:

[1] FALSE

So vectors can't have attributes. Those are getting stripped off by
as.vector(), so in some sense something is making sense... does look
like a bit strange, BUT:

S-PLUS : Copyright (c) 1988, 1996 MathSoft, Inc.
S : Copyright AT&T.
Version 3.4 Release 1 for Sun SPARC, SunOS 5.3 : 1996 
Working data will be in .Data

[1] T
> g<-factor(1:3)
> is.vector(g)
[1] F
> is.vector(as.vector(g))
[1] T

I.e., exactly the same. And to top it off:

> is.vector(gl(20,2,40))            
[1] F

er, that's cheating! There's no 'gl' function in S-plus, but:

> gl
function(n, k, length, labels = 1:n, ordered = FALSE)
factor(rep(rep(1:n, rep(k, n)), length = length), labels = labels)

(apparently I hacked one up at some earlier point while trying to run
R's glm+lm demo through Splus...)

I have rpm packages for R which were built and tested on
RedHat 5.0. I will be uploading these to CRAN shortly, when
I have finished ironing out the few remaining wrinkles.

Subject: R-beta: "smooth sbezier" blew up too much data, need code
Message-ID: <19980126232637.16414.qmail@hotmail.com>



Hello All,

I am in need of sample code to create gnuplot's sbezier output in 
numerical form.  Below are some details of what I have done.

I just fed 2000 lines of data to the above gplot script and it seg 
faulted, when I cut the data down it down it worked fine.

The results are very good for the purpose, which is to give a 
guestimation as to what fills the spaces between the exceptions.

When used with other highly varing data it makes the lines far more 
readable for the purpose of comparing systems while looking for 
problems.

The smooth sbezier function starts by making "the data monotonic in x"
and then applying the bezier function. What I need to do is take the 
functions out of gnuplot and translate them into perl.  Once outside can 
run the regression script and then I have a single line for visual 
forcasting and also I will be able to run exponential smoothing to 
enhance forcasting.  Another issue with respect to systems forcasting is 
"seasonality as refered to by the census."  Daily, weekly and monthly 
data operations tend to run in cycles.

Any leads to awk, C or perl code would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance, John van V aka johnvv at hotmail.com

gets installed at once. Is this a correct way of doing it?

Hmm... I have the same problem on hpux10.20. I put the additional libs into a
subdir called contrib, and R INSTALL from there. I have R-0.61.1 Alpha Dec21
1997. Without restored data they work OK.

Subject: R-beta: help in rsept

Is it possible to get information on libraries or data sets in R 
for windows? E.g. under Unix I would type ?library(whatever)...
I have made some simple functions for teaching and spent hours writing
the documentation for my students who now may not even be able to
read it... aarghh

Apologies if this is a FAQ, couldn't find anything on it in the 
archives.

The problem lies with the character vector ".Dyn.libs" which is
kept in the global environment and is apparently saved from one
R session to another.

The R function library.dynam, which does the dynamic loading, checks
against this vector to see if any of it's entries are already loaded.
In the second R session, the survival4 and splines shared object files
are not loaded because R thinks they are already there.

I believe there is a lingering problem in the 0.61 version of R that
the list of shared objects that have been loaded by the library.dynam
function is stored in .Rdata.  It should not be stored there, it
should be in the "session data" (whatever that is called).

That is, library.dynam currently reads as
 > library.dynam
 function (name, package = .packages(), lib.loc = .lib.loc) 
 {
	 if (!exists(".Dyn.libs")) 
		 assign(".Dyn.libs", character(0), envir = .GlobalEnv)
	 LEN <- nchar(name)
	 if (substr(name, LEN - 2, LEN) == ".so") {
		 name <- substr(name, 1, LEN - 3)
	 }
	 if (is.na(match(name, .Dyn.libs))) {
		 file <- system.file(paste("libs", "/", name, 
			 ".", "so", sep = ""), package, lib.loc)
		 if (file == "") {
			 stop(paste("dynamic library `", name, 
				 "' not found", sep = ""))
		 }
		 .Internal(dyn.load(file))
		 assign(".Dyn.libs", c(.Dyn.libs, name), envir = .GlobalEnv)
	 }
	 invisible(.Dyn.libs)
 }

but those assignments of the ".Dyn.libs" should not take place in the
.GlobalEnv because they get restored at the next session even though
the libraries have not been loaded.

A temporary fix for this might be to create a .First function (if you
don't already have one) and add
 remove(".Dyn.libs", envir=.GlobalEnv)
to it.

I guess I can't duck this issue any more. For a variety of reasons I
have not been able to get R for Windows updated. There is a better
than 50% chance that I will not do so before the end of Feb. (this
is important because classes start after that and I will have even
less time). 

I will be spending much of the next three weeks trying to get a port
done and if it goes well then I will release it. However, the changes
to R over the past 3 months are very substantial and I doubt that
three weeks (1/2 time) will be enough to achieve a reasonable
copy.

On to Ron's problem. Unfortunately R recieves no funds and hence we cannot
really develop it at the speed we would like to. The Windows and Mac
versions often lag well behind Unix (sometimes years as is currently
the case with the Mac version). Anyone developing software for their
students is advised to use the version of R for development that they
intend to have their students use. While Ross, myself and the entire
development team put a large amount of effort in to R development
it will never be enough. We don't want people to have bad experiences
but there are limits to our abilities and available time.
Please remember that we get almost no credit and no remuneration for
out activities in this area.

To R developers (Ross, Robert et al.):
I think R is great.
I also think it is fit and proper that you set your platform priorities.
I also think unix is the right one to concentrate on, since R is GPL'ed in
the spirit of Linux.  Why port free software to nonfree operating systems?

To R users on non-unix platforms:
If you are not happy with the current state of affairs with R on your
platform, you should probably switch platforms!  I mean that seriously.  I

Unfortunately, that is not always an option. Many of us use R for
teaching and however much we hate Windoze, that is what the students
have and what is installed in the computer labs (mine are medical PhD
students, mind you, not an easy crowd to sway to Linux). 

What we really need is an integrated development tree, set up so that
we shouldn't have to send Robert on his periodic two-month porting
expeditions, but simply (cross-)compile for the Win32 target and go
testing and debugging. However, this is not entirely trivial to do.

I've been playing around some, but the Windows API is more than a
little forbidding to get into. Straight CLI ports can be done fairly
easily, for W95/NT at least.

In a previous message I suggested getting everyone to convert to Win95 or Linux
only partly in jest. It has often occurred to me that your plan to support so
many operating environments is very ambitious, and I always hoped that it was
because of some magic in the underlying code.

My guess is that Window 3.1 will almost disappear within two years, so you're
efforts to support that are for a very short return. I realize that there may be
a lot of classroom labs out there, where people are running Windows 3.1 on old
386s with not much memory, but one really should be looking at Linux for that
situation. The performance appears to be much better, and the speed with which
Linux is moving into the mainstream, at least in North America, is truely
phenomenal.

Of course, Win95 and Mac become more religous questions, but Linux does run on
these machines, so people can have the most current version of R if they want.

If they could boot Linux from a CD and run R, without having to install on the
computers, do you think it would be an option then?

     Suggested Heuristic Approaches for Dealing with Probabilistic,
                    Combinatorial Decision Problems.

The mathematical representation of several important decision problems can
be described as a combinatorial choice of values of decision variables in
the presence of other probabilistic variables that affect the objective
function and/or the constraints to be satisfied.  The description implies a
very difficult optimization problem.  Some practical illustrations of such
problems will be described.  Then, two solution approaches will be
presented.  One is for the situation where it is practical to obtain the
exact optimal solution given values of the probabilistic variables, while
the other deals with the context where optimisation is not even guaranteed
under such circumstances, thus necessitating some form of search procedure.
Both approaches make use of statistical sampling to estimate the value of
the objective function at any particular solution being investigated.

Subject: R-beta: executable problem
Message-ID: <20194036405223@man-env.com>

I downloaded the rseptbeta.zip and exe.zip files for Windows (I'm 
running Win 95 4.00.950a) about three weeks ago and until now had 
been very impressed. 

Today the executable rsept.exe (dated 10/29/97) went strange. It would 
open a window and immediately close the window (I've seen this 
before when inadvertently trying to open certain non-windows 
applications within windows). Here is what I then tried (in order): 
1) I tried re-installing the executable from exe.zip and had the same 
result. 
2) I tried re-installing all of the files in both rseptbeta.zip and 
exe.zip but had the same result. 
3) I re-downloaded the rseptbeta.zip file and re-installed. R began 
working. 
4) I then re-downloaded the exe.zip file and installed it. R stopped 
working (same problem as before).

Could I have done something that caused this problem? Could Win95 
have done something to cause this problem? I'm running the older 
executable for now. Any suggestions (besides changing my OS) would be 
appreciated.

Same thing here. I had the same problem under Windows NT but not
under Windows 95. The executable in exe.zip works fine on my
notebook which runs on Win 95 but not on my desktop which runs
on Windows NT. Any ideas why? Best, Francisco.

My best guess is that R is asking for more memory than your system has
available. I've put some message boxes in the version I'm working on now
(still 0.5 vintage though) and I should have it out soon. You could try
rebooting and making sure that all other applications are closed. You
could also have a look in the registry (using regedit) and remove the
NSize and Vsize records under R. One of the bad things about Windows95 and
NT is the registry. It maintains a record of things even after the software
has been removed. Re-installing software often doesn't fix all the necessary
files in registry and so some problems can't be solved by reinstallation.

This is a problem that has been bothering me for some time.  At the
moment, I use RedHat Linux, Octave, occasionally R and other FSF/GPL
products.  They are generally better, at least in their fundamental
design, than the commercial versions but there is no clear mechanism to
ensure their continued development.  They certainly don't spend anything
on marketing.

Commercial products are not only expensive - much of which is the cost of
marketing, including attending conferences and going on jamborees - but in
some cases not only has the product booted off public domain software but
also maintains it's credibility by the large amount of publically
available procedures, macros etc that are put up on web and ftp sites
round the world.  I find this a bit unethical.  Oh - you generally get a
box and a glossy book. Other commercial products of course are genuinely
written from the ground up and I have no problem with that. 

I gather that if you get s/ware via FSF official sources (ie on a CD or
tape(!)), then some money filters back.  I have recently bought RedHat 5
partly for this reason.  However, most of us download off the net and end
up paying the telephone companies only.  The GPL doesn't forbid charging
for support and development - a point noticed by RedHat who now also make
available commercial support for their latest Linux version.

What is needed is (a) an easy mechanism to make contributions, (b) 
invoices (perhaps electronically generated) so that the tax-man can be
kept at bay or the cost recovered via an expenses claim.  

I think the solution is simple and would like to see an FSF-organised
world central approach with easy payment (including by credit card, which
is the best way for international payments), electronic or postal
invoicing, and a payer-specified target product(s) so that on-going
support can be ensured.  The product developers could distribute the funds
as they see fit - very popular (and good) products might attract a
considerable income while less popular products might get nothing.  This
is also a market. 

Of course, this could be set up on a product-specific basis so that you
had an R-account into which users would be gently encouraged to pour a
little cash from time to time - noting the requirement for credit cards
and invoicing above - but it would be better if organised on a GPL/FSF
world basis so that general develpoment funds could be made available for
FSF to make grants. 

I might send a sum to FSF - perhaps even by standing order every year -
with say 20% going to R, 20% to octave, 20% to general support etc etc and
trust FSF to distribute these funds honestly so that you guys out there
who do so much to generate good software can get something for your pains
(apart from the nice feeling of being the good guys that is!).  Like most
users, given time, I wuold like to be able to contribute to the coding but
(a) I don't know enough about the ins and outs of the R product or C
programming and (b) these are better developed by a fairly small team of
real experts anyway.  So all I can do is support R etc and try to solve
problems myself before bothering you with silly questions (actually there
aren't too many of these on the R list but I do see on other lists that
should really be answered with read the manual).

It is in all our interests to promote the continued availability and
future development as well as to support the continued help available via
mailing lists such as this (rather more prompt than many commercial
responses!).  Maybe cynics might expect noone to pay anything and maybe
some wouldn't. But the alternative is to let Mr Gates and his ilk take
over the world and let the FSF ideal die.

So, Robert, Ross and everyone, your work is appreciated and obviously you
can't be expected to support every platform/OS simultaneously.  But some
funds I guess would help.  Is this a way forward? 

Best wishes

John

I have uploaded them yesterday, so they should have made it to most

My experience is that much of the freeware I use is better than
the commercial alternatives, but certainly not all of it.  I use
the good stuff and bypass the marginal stuff (whether free or
commercial).

IMO, what you're describing is just shareware, but with an
enormous bureaucracy added on top.

I can already hear the bickering and infighting over who will
get FSF "general support" funding for what projects each year.
FSF has to hire more and more lawyers to stave off "why not me"
lawsuits.  The Europeans complain that the Australians are
getting a disproportionate fraction of funds.  Governments get
involved.  Your standing-order donation is soon an annual tax,
with a percentage shaved off for the U.N., who acts as collector
and overseer.  Rules are established to require various
certifications and qualifications for UNFSF funding...

Freeware is working fine as it is.  Indeed, its success is
mind-boggling.  Let's don't mess it up.

There needs to be more recognition in the academic community of the 
importance of contributions to widely used software.  While many
organizations are encouraging software development if it generates
revenue, it is harder to measure the value of software that you 
give away.  It is often hard to measure the number of users, so unless
they mention you in citations, there is little hard evidence to show
the value of your contribution. 

There are two ways I "pay" for software, but one is easy to measure while
the other is "hidden".  Some software is good enough that I'm willing to
pay for it, but lots more software that is not as polished but useful if I
spend some time hacking at it (and some that never does quite work
despite my efforts!).  Not only is is hard for your boss/dean to see
how much effort I'm willing to "spend" so I can use your program, but
even if she could see this, she wouldn't know if the effort was high
because your program was useful or just poorly done.  It doesn't help
to ask people to send letters to the boss, as I can do that without any
real investment of time or money.  

I think what would work is for various academic/professional organizations
to create awards and other forms of recognition for contributions in the 
form of software.  There would need to be nominations and a selection
panel.  Not only would this benefit authors, it would also help users
identify useful tools.  The problem is that you might encounter opposition
from some commercial vendors who don't want more people taking R
seriously.

My experience is that much of the freeware I use is better than
the commercial alternatives, but certainly not all of it.  I use
the good stuff and bypass the marginal stuff (whether free or
commercial).

As mentioned earlier I want to decentralize the package descriptions
of all contributed packages:

Please make sure to include a file called DESCRIPTION in every package
which looks like:

**********************************************************

Package: e1071
Version: 0.7-3
Author: Compiled by Fritz Leisch <Friedrich.Leisch at ci.tuwien.ac.at>.
Description: Miscellaneous functions used at the Department of
        Statistics at TU Wien (E1071). 
Copyright: GPL

**********************************************************

Further you can use a field called `Depends:' to include a
comma-seperated list of pre-requisited packages.

PLEASE MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE A COPYRIGHT LINE IN THE DESCRIPTION!!!

Continuation lines begin with a whitespace character (as in
Description above).

You can take the file $CRAN/src/contrib/PACKAGES as templates (but
don't forget to add the Copyright line :-). This file will be built
automatically by concatenating all DESCRIPTION files.

To all maintainers of current packages: Could you please update the
packages by including the DESCRIPTION file?

Best,
Fritz

Hi All,

I have a personal interest in these matters because I am a Linux VAR
and I am about to add-value-to an accouting package, hopefully 
bringing LX into the enterprise areana.

The fun part of computing is developing and integrating.  At the moment, 
for instance, I am trying to compile multi threading perl but 
I am flying blind making changes where I think they will help.
Experience tells me that posting to the inet is as likely to attract 
flames as any useful information, if I get any response at all.

I believe the freeware needs help in the organization and documentation 
areas, in other words, admin assistants.

This way the direction of development would not be controlled by any 
corp but still by the whims of the coders and the squeaky wheel method
of internet democracy.

Other than that, I sent a long letter to Chip of the perl group, 
suggesting that a perl credit union, and perl legal agency, and group 
insurance and ....

You get the picture but Chip did not.

BTW I got flamed for asking a statistical question in this group,
so watch out!!

Subject: R-beta: Fig driver for "R"?
Message-ID: <34D1B59A.584526FE@ipe.pw.edu.pl>

    Hello all R users and developers!

In the "Notes on R" I have found the following information:
(page 60, 13-th footnote) "... a better solution is to use the fig()
driver (available from statlib) and use a conversion program, such as
fig2dev, to convert the resultant fig code to Encapsulated Podtscript."
I was very glad to read it, because I'm often forced to use specifically
Polish characters (like L-stroke, a-ogonek etc.) in my drawings' legend,
and passing the texts through fig2dev gives a possibility to use LaTeX
(in fact "babel") syntax for defining international characters.

I downloaded the fig driver from statlib (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/S/),
and try to compile it, however without success. The gcc complains about
"device.h" file, which is not available (even in R sources).
Where can I find this file?

                 Thanks in advance
                 Wojciech Zabolotny
                 wzab at ipe.pw.edu.pl
BTW. The "fig" driver is very old ()
