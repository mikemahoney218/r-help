Thank you Rui.? I didn't know about the check.names = FALSE argument.? 
Another good reminder to always read help, but I'm not sure I understood 
what help to read in this case.? Since your clue, I've discovered that a 
tibble-based strategy could also work.

x = seq(min(cob_wt$`plant-density`), max(cob_wt$`plant-density`), length 
= 999)
xvals = tibble(`plant-density` = x)
CI.c = predict(mod2, newdata = xvals, interval = 'c')
CI.p = predict(mod2,? newdata = xvals,? interval = 'p')

Again, appreciate the solution.

?data.frame , of course, which says:

"check.names

logical. If TRUE then the names of the variables in the data frame are
checked to ensure that they are syntactically valid variable names and
are not duplicated. If necessary they are adjusted (by make.names) so
that they are. "

Subject: [R] Mann Kendall mutation package?
Message-ID: <CABxY9BOiviytVdHU0bhnTQ6jZrBr9Pyi2k9EOO7jfYfCeUFBBA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello - does anyone know whether there are any packages for Mann-Kendall
mutation tests in R available?  The only one I could find online is this
MK_mut_test: Mann-Kendall mutation test in Sibada/sibadaR: Sibada's
accumulated R scripts for next probably use to avoid reinventing the wheel.
(rdrr.io) <https://rdrr.io/github/Sibada/sibadaR/man/MK_mut_test.html> but
there doesn't seem to be a package corresponding to this.  I've tried
installing various permutations of the apparent name Sibada/sibadaR but
nothing comes up, so I'm not sure whether it even exists...

Thanks Nick Wray

Hello,

Your link points to a GitHub repository, the package can be installed with


devtools::install_github(repo = "Sibada/sibadaR")



Hope this helps

Also, and possibly more constructively, when you get an error like
 
> CI.c = predict(mod2, data.frame( `plant-density` = x), interval = 'c')  # fail
Error in eval(predvars, data, env) : object 'plant-density' not found

you should check your assumptions. Does "newdata" actually contain a columnn called "plant-density":

> head(data.frame( `plant-density` = x))
  plant.density
1      65.00000
2      65.11912
3      65.23824
4      65.35736
5      65.47648
6      65.59560
> 

I.e., it doesn't. So check help for data.frame and looking for something with names.

   Have you looked at the Kendall package?

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62288340/mann-kendall-in-r

  (you've cross-posted a version of this question to SO as well:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77587426/what-is-the-algorithm-for-the-mann-kendall-mutation-test

)

Please don't cross-post between the R help lists and other forums like 
SO -- it dilutes/duplicates effort.
