Thank you Rui.? I didn't know about the check.names = FALSE argument.? 
Another good reminder to always read help, but I'm not sure I understood 
what help to read in this case.? Since your clue, I've discovered that a 
tibble-based strategy could also work.

x = seq(min(cob_wt$`plant-density`), max(cob_wt$`plant-density`), length 
= 999)
xvals = tibble(`plant-density` = x)
CI.c = predict(mod2, newdata = xvals, interval = 'c')
CI.p = predict(mod2,? newdata = xvals,? interval = 'p')

Again, appreciate the solution.

?data.frame , of course, which says:

"check.names

logical. If TRUE then the names of the variables in the data frame are
checked to ensure that they are syntactically valid variable names and
are not duplicated. If necessary they are adjusted (by make.names) so
that they are. "

Subject: [R] Mann Kendall mutation package?
Message-ID: <CABxY9BOiviytVdHU0bhnTQ6jZrBr9Pyi2k9EOO7jfYfCeUFBBA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello - does anyone know whether there are any packages for Mann-Kendall
mutation tests in R available?  The only one I could find online is this
MK_mut_test: Mann-Kendall mutation test in Sibada/sibadaR: Sibada's
accumulated R scripts for next probably use to avoid reinventing the wheel.
(rdrr.io) <https://rdrr.io/github/Sibada/sibadaR/man/MK_mut_test.html> but
there doesn't seem to be a package corresponding to this.  I've tried
installing various permutations of the apparent name Sibada/sibadaR but
nothing comes up, so I'm not sure whether it even exists...

Thanks Nick Wray

Hello,

Your link points to a GitHub repository, the package can be installed with


devtools::install_github(repo = "Sibada/sibadaR")



Hope this helps

Also, and possibly more constructively, when you get an error like
 
> CI.c = predict(mod2, data.frame( `plant-density` = x), interval = 'c')  # fail
Error in eval(predvars, data, env) : object 'plant-density' not found

you should check your assumptions. Does "newdata" actually contain a columnn called "plant-density":

> head(data.frame( `plant-density` = x))
  plant.density
1      65.00000
2      65.11912
3      65.23824
4      65.35736
5      65.47648
6      65.59560
> 

I.e., it doesn't. So check help for data.frame and looking for something with names.

   Have you looked at the Kendall package?

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62288340/mann-kendall-in-r

  (you've cross-posted a version of this question to SO as well:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77587426/what-is-the-algorithm-for-the-mann-kendall-mutation-test

)

Please don't cross-post between the R help lists and other forums like 
SO -- it dilutes/duplicates effort.

Subject: [R] adding "Page X of XX" to PDFs
Message-ID: <960162E8-0227-4745-AAF4-D8DF6BC36204@plessthan.com>

OS X
R 4.3.1

Colleagues

I often create multipage PDFs [pdf()] in which the text "Page X" appears in the margin.  These PDFs are created automatically using a massive R script.

One of my clients requested that I change this to:
	Page X of XX 
where XX is the total number of pages.  

I don't know the number of expected pages so I can't think of any clever way to do this.  I suppose that I could create the PDF, find out the number of pages, then have a second pass in which the R script was fed the number of pages.  However, there is one disadvantage to this -- the original PDF contains a timestamp on each page -- the new version would have a different timestamp -- so I would prefer to not use this approach.

Has anyone thought of some terribly clever way to solve this problem?

Can you provide a very simplified version of how the PDF is created?

One of the most fundamental characteristics of R programming is the use of data frames of column vectors, and one of the very first challenges I had as a then-Perl-programmer was coming to grips with the fact that unknown-length CSV files would be read completely into memory as rows and once the entire CSV was in memory it would be transposed into column vectors. I was resistant to this philosophy at first, but the advantages in computation speed and simplicity eventually won me over.

I would say that if you want to know how many pages you are going to produce with R, then you are going to have to count them before you create them. Building a dataframe that describes (in terms of parameters to be passed to a page-generating function in each row) what you are going to put on each page before you actually print it can make this pre-counting problem trivial, and the code that does the printing is likely to be more modular and testable as well.

Would this work in general? Say I have a document with figures, special equations, text, and tables. The text and tables are relatively easy. The figures would need a conversion from pixels to lines, and the equations maybe printed out, counted as a figure, and then added to the line count. It would also be tricky if a title line was at 32 point font and the text at 12, and the more complex the formatting the harder to deal with rows as related to page size.

Thankfully I do not think I will have to do this, so the question is for theoretical interest on my part (at least for now).

   It's still not entirely clear to me what framework you're using to 
generate the PDF, but if it's rmarkdown/Rnw (Sweave)/Quarto-based, then 
as far as I know all of those frameworks use LaTeX as the last step in 
the script-to-PDF pipeline, and allow the inclusion of arbitrary LaTeX 
code, so the 'lastpage' package would do this for you:

He clearly stated he was using the pdf() graphics device.

    Sorry, jumped into the thread too late. (On the other hand, once the 
document gets complicated enough, it may be worth it in the long run to 
convert to something that actually has a document-generating back-end, 
rather than reinventing everything from scratch ...)

I agree with that comment.  However, if one is stuck with a multipage 
PDF file, and wants to add page numbering, you could use the LaTeX 
pdfpages package.

For example, this R Markdown document includes all 10 plots from 
Rplots.pdf on pages with "x of y" page numbering.

   ---
   title: "Numbered"
   output:
     pdf_document:
       extra_dependencies: ["pdfpages", "fancyhdr", "lastpage"]
   ---

   \cfoot{Page \thepage\ of \pageref{LastPage}}

   \addtocounter{page}{-1}

   \includepdf[pages={1-10},pagecommand={\thispagestyle{fancy}}]{Rplots.pdf}


It would make more sense to do this in a LaTeX document, but I'm not 
sure if Dennis knows LaTeX...

Having read all of the replies, it seems there are solutions for the
question and the OP points out that some solutions such as making the
document twice will affect the creation date.

I suspect the additional time to do so is seconds or at most minutes so it
may not be a big deal.

But what about the idea of creating a PDF with a placeholder like "Page N of
XXX" and after the file has been created, dates and all, perhaps edit it
programmatically and replace all instances of XXX with something of the same
length like " 23" as there seem to be tools like the pdftools package that
let you get the number of pages. I have no idea if some program, perhaps
external, can do that and retain the date you want.

Subject: [R] adding "Page X of XX" to PDFs

OS X
R 4.3.1

Colleagues

I often create multipage PDFs [pdf()] in which the text "Page X" appears in
the margin.  These PDFs are created automatically using a massive R script.

One of my clients requested that I change this to:
	Page X of XX 
where XX is the total number of pages.  

I don't know the number of expected pages so I can't think of any clever way
to do this.  I suppose that I could create the PDF, find out the number of
pages, then have a second pass in which the R script was fed the number of
pages.  However, there is one disadvantage to this -- the original PDF
contains a timestamp on each page -- the new version would have a different
timestamp -- so I would prefer to not use this approach.

Has anyone thought of some terribly clever way to solve this problem?

You could easily omit the Page X of xX, but leave the timestamp

Then add Page X of XX programmatically using pdftools or some similar pdf
command line tools.

You don't need to use command line tools -- I showed how to do it by 
creating an R Markdown document with each page of the PDF on a numbered 
page of the result.

Here's a minor improvement of my post:

    ---
    title: "Numbered"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        extra_dependencies: ["pdfpages", "fancyhdr", "lastpage"]
    ---

    \cfoot{Page \thepage\ of \pageref{LastPage}}

    \addtocounter{page}{-1}

    \includepdf[pages={1-},pagecommand={\thispagestyle{fancy}}]{Rplots.pdf}


This works regardless of the number of pages in Rplots.pdf.

Dear Marc,

Plugging the BLUPs into the likelihood isn't going to give you the ll of the model. You need to integrate over the random effect.

intfun <- function(nu, xi, mi, pred, theta)
   dbinom(xi, xi+mi, plogis(nu)) * dnorm(nu, pred, theta)

lli <- rep(NA, nrow(df))

for (i in 1:nrow(df)) {
   lli[i] <- log(integrate(intfun, xi=df[i,1], mi=df[i,2], pred=fixep[1] + fixep[2]*x[i], theta=par$theta, lower=-Inf, upper=Inf)$value)
}

-sum(lli)

Best,
Wolfgang

Looks like `lsb_release -cs` returns a Mint codename for you.
Thankfully, since we know that Linux Mint 21 is based on Ubuntu 22.04
"Jammy Jellyfish", it should be possible to replace $(lsb_release -cs)
with jammy when running the command. Does the jammy-cran40/
subdirectory work for you?

Steve,

The better list for such questions is r-sig-debian.

There is no such thing as 'victoria-cran40' at these servers.

Use jammy-cran40 if you want the Ubuntu 22.04 binaries, otherwise use

Fit NLE - was: [R] computer algebra in R
Original post:
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2023-November/478619.html

Dear Kornad,

I think I have started to understand what you try to achieve. The problem is to fit a NLE and compute the parameters of the NL-Eq. I have included the R Help-list back in the loop, as I am not an expert in optimization.

Goal:
y ~ I0 +  IHD * hd + ID * d;
where:
y = given vector of measurements;
x = given vector of values;
I0, IHD, ID, kd = parameters to optimize;
hd = satisfies a polynomial of order 3;

As d = d0 - hd, the previous formula can be written:
y ~ I0 + ID * d0 +  (IHD - ID) * hd;

f(x, hd, kd) = 0,
where f = a polynomial of order 3 in hd and order 2 in kd;
d0 (and other components of the polynomial) = given constants;

1) First Approach
I would back-substitute hd into the polynomial:
hd = (y - I0 - ID*d0) / (IHD - ID);

f(x, hd, kd) becomes then f(x, y, kd, I0, ID, IHD) = 0;
- f is order 3 in y;

You could fit:
(y^3) ~ f(x, y, kd, I0, ID, IHD) - y^3,
where you subtract the y^3 term from the function f, and add the (y^3) values as a new columng to the data.frame:
data.frame(y3 = y^3, y=y, x=x)

If the values of y are versy small (abs(y) << 1), then it may be wiser to fit:
y ~ f(x, y^2, y^3, kd, I0, ID, IHD) - (y-term);

But I am not an expert in these problems. Other R-users may be more helpful.

2.) Approach 2: Math
I feel that the problem can be solved quasy-exactly as well. It is much harder with 4 parameters to optimize:
- one needs to compute the 4 partial derivatives;
- solve the resulting system of 4 polynomial equations;

The system is polynomial; although it looks ugly and I am not inclined to do such calculations myself.

I hope that you can get more useful answers from the R help-list.

Sincerely,

Leonard

The volume of a polygon  = 0.  Polyhedra  have volumes.

This may be irrelevant, but if the lake is cylindrical == constant cross
sectional area at all depths, then height doubles when the volume does and
vice versa.  Otherwise you have to know how area varies with height or use
more sensible approximations thereto.

Cheers,
Bert

Dear Bert;
Thank you for your reply. The reservoir is not cylindrica. This is the
table I have created from the data extracted.
Maybe there is a way to get the relation between Elevation, Area and Volume
to get the elevation at a specific Volume.

A raster is just a matrix of elevations. Each element of that matrix has a horizontal area. If you subtract that elevation from a reference elevation and zero out all negative values then you are left with a bunch of rectangular parallelopipeds of varying height. Add those heights up and multiply by the scalar area of the parallelopipeds and you have the volume. Repeat this for various elevations and form a set of estimates of volume vs elevation. You can use approxfun or splinefun to create a function from those points for more general use.

There are some subtleties such as converting between elevation and depth, and whether you are concerned about disjoint depressions (they would not drain)... but OP really should have read the posting guide and asked this question on R-sig-geo mailing list.

Hi,

As already mentioned, this is a great topic for R-sig-geo, where you'd
probably get specialist answers like the lake morphology package
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lakemorpho/index.html which is
explicitly designed for this kind of question.

Subject: [R] How to calculate relative risk from GAM model in mgcv package?
Message-ID: <CAEEWTq+1oprpVmFVw5+8cUr-6KoJF63Cht9qyvmR1hq55dGz6A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi R users,I am a beginner in the use of R. I need urgent help for my
thesis study.
<https://stats.stackexchange.com/posts/633206/timeline>

I have daily air pollution parameters PM10, PM2.5 CO, NO2, SO2, and O3. I
also have daily hospital admission numbers. Taking into account the effect
of weekends and holidays, I would like to used generalised additive model
(GAM) to explore the relationship between daily patients admissions, and
air pollution parameters. I would like tu use mgcv package. How to get
overall relative risk and 95%CI for every pollutant?

I don't know if it's correct but here are the codes I used:

install.packages("mgcv")

library(mgcv)

data=read.csv2(file.choose(),header=TRUE)

data$date <- as.Date(data$date, format="%d.%m.%Y")


data$weekend <- factor(data$weekend)


data$holiday <- factor(data$holiday)


model <- gam(adm ~ s(PM10, k = 5) + s(PM2.5, k = 5) + s(CO, k = 5) + s(NO2,
k = 5) + s(SO2, k = 5) + s(O3, k = 5) + weekend + holiday, family =
quasipoisson(link = "log"), data = data, method = "REML")

pred <- predict.gam (model, type = "response")

relative_risk <- exp(pred$fit)

However, when I look at the results, it calculates RR for 365 days
separately.

How can I get a result like the table 4 in this article (
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36161569/)? There is only one RR
calculation for each pollutant.

I would be very grateful if you could help me. Thank you.

Hello,

Coerce with ?as.POSIXct
Don't forget the underscore in the format.


as.POSIXct("2020-09-17_00:00:00", format = "%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S")


Hope this helps,

Dear all,


first I would like to thank Leo for his help and advice. My sincere 
apologies for the delayed response; regrettably, I overlooked the email.


In order to characterize the problem a bit better I want to give 
additional information and clarify the point where I have problems.


First of all the equation system is defined as:

h0 = h + hd + hg,
d0 = d + hd,
ga0 = ga + hg,
kga = hg/(h*ga),
kd = hd/(h*d)


The aim is to fit a non-linear equation in the form: signal ~ I0 + IHD * 
hd + ID * d.


The parameters which should be identified/optimized are: I0, ID, IHD and 
kd. However, the only information known is kga (33600.0), h0 
(0.0000208), d0 (0.000079) and the guest concentration (= ga0).

In Mathematica the equation system is repeatedly solved for hd and d. 
First the system 0 = h + hd + hga, 33600. = d + hd, ga0 = ga + hga, 
0.000079 = hga/(ga*h), 0.0000208 = hd/(d*h) is passed to the Eliminate 
function which eliminates four variables. In the case for hd the 
variables h, d, hga and ga are eliminated. The resulting system is:? 
3.71035392*^12 + 2.635566*^8*hd - 3783.*hd^2 == ga0*(-1.72536*^8 + 
5135.*hd). Afterwards this system is used by a numerical solver to get 
the result of hd.

My problem is how to replicate the Eliminate function in R. Or is it 
possible to solely solve the system numerically?


Thanks a lot in advance.

All the best,

Konrad

Very simple with base R:

You will not be able to store these datetime values in an R matrix, at 
least as class POSIXct. You could with class POSIXlt, but I've not seen 
it used before but it does appear possible since matrices can contain 
lists.

R matrices do no provide the capability to assign attributes, so only 
atomic types and lists can be elements. If you wanted to maintain the 
same structure, your first step might be to coerce to a data.frame and 
then proceed, or to first construct a vector and then use as the first 
argument to `matrix`.

The general sentiment is correct (it's hard to put POSIXct elements in 
matrices), but it's not impossible.  Almost all R objects can have 
attributes.

For example,

   m <- matrix(Sys.time(), 2,2)

converts the time to a numerical value, but you can view it as a POSIXlt 
object using

   class(m) <- c("POSIXct", class(m))

Subsetting works, e.g. m[1,1] is a time, etc.

Subject: [R] Convert two-dimensional array into a three-dimensional array.
Message-ID: <DM6PR03MB504979641A471930217570CCE28AA@DM6PR03MB5049.namprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Colleagues

I want to convert a 10x2 array:
# create a 10x2 matrix.
datavals <- matrix(nrow=10,ncol=2)
datavals[,] <- rep(c(1,2),10)+c(rnorm(10),rnorm(10))
datavals

into a 10x3 array, ThreeDArray, dim(10,2,10).

The values storede in  ThreeDArray's first dimensions will be the data stored in datavalues.
ThreeDArray[i,,] <- datavals[i,]

The values storede in  ThreeDArray's second dimensions will be the data stored in datavalues.
ThreeDArray[,j,] <- datavals[,j]

The data stored in ThreeDArray[,,1] will be 1, 
The data stored in ThreeDArray[,,2] will be 2.
 . . . 
The data stored in ThreeDArray[,,10] will be 10.

I have no idea how to code the coversion of the 10x2 matrix into a 10,2,10 array.
I may be able to acomplish my mission by coding each line of the plan described above,
but there has to be a more efficient and elegant way to accompish my goal.

Many thanks for your help!
John

OK. I'm not getting what you want, so feel free to ignore this if you think
I've missed the point completely and don't want to waste your time. Won't
be my first time clueless.

A 3-D array can be  thought of as as a "pile" of 2-D flats, so a 10 x 2 x
10 array consists of 10 2-d flats, each 10 x 2. So tell me what you want
the first 10x2 flat to contain, then the second, etc.  Here is a print
representation of a 2 x 4 x 3 array that might help:

> array(1:24, dim = c(2,4,3))
, , 1

     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    3    5    7
[2,]    2    4    6    8

, , 2

     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    9   11   13   15
[2,]   10   12   14   16

, , 3

     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]   17   19   21   23
[2,]   18   20   22   24

FWIW, it sounds to me like you just do something like:

> dval <- matrix(1:8, nrow = 2)
> dval
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    3    5    7
[2,]    2    4    6    8
> ar <- array(dval, dim = c(2,4,3))
> ar
, , 1

     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    3    5    7
[2,]    2    4    6    8

, , 2

     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    3    5    7
[2,]    2    4    6    8

, , 3

     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]    1    3    5    7
[2,]    2    4    6    8

since the 3rd array index itself provides the values you refer to. But this
doesn't make sense to me, so I've probably misinterpreted.

Cheers,
Bert

Dear Shailendra Pal,

Welcome to the R-help mailing list! Most of us are not members of
RStudio in any way. Your problem is also purely about programming in R,
so you've come to the right place. You have also done the right thing
by showing us the code.

One of the most important tools provided by R is its online help
system. Use it to look up the documentation for the function you're
having problems with. You can prepend a question mark to most function
calls and get a help page in response; failing that, help('cca') should
also work. Here's what it says:

>> ## Default S3 method:
>> cca(X, Y, Z, ...)

>> X Community data matrix.
>> Y Constraining matrix, typically of environmental variables

In other words, the "community data matrix" mentioned in the error
message is your `sptrans` data.frame. The function complains that at
least some of the rows don't have a positive sum, which is a
requirement of the method. Can you spot the problem by looking at the
data or using rowSums()?

Dear Shailendra,

For me the problem is not related to R or Rstudio or even vegan. The CCA
analysis can not be done with denuded site, as the sum will be zero.

"all row sums must be >0 in the community data matrix"

GCC

Subject: [R] Linear model and approx function
Message-ID: <CANTxAm+gK=LLQ40_cQd+D3eEpO31Ki5UNk=+-33KB2i27oH22w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all;

I have a dataframe with several columns. The columns are the elevation,
volume  and the area of the cells (which were placed inside a polygon). I
have extracted them from DEM raster to calculate the volume under polygon
and the elevation for a specific volume of the reservoir.

> head(x6,2)
  Elevation       Vol      Area     V_sum      A_sum
1 2145  13990.38  85.83053  13990.38   85.83053
2 2147  43129.18 267.88312  57119.56  353.71365

> tail(x6,2)
 Elevation      Vol      Area      V_sum    A_sum
158  2307 233.0276 233.02756 1771806968 15172603
159  2308   0.0000  71.65642 1771806968 15172674

I used a linear model to estimate the elevation for a specific volume, but
the codes do not work properly.

lm1 = lm(x6[,1]~x6[,4])
new_volume <- 3,000,000,000
pred_elev <- predict(lm1, newdata = data.frame(volume = new_volume))
pred_elev

The results just estimated for the 159 rows of the dataframe, not the new
volume.

> tail(pred_elev)
     154      155      156      157      158      159
2254.296 2254.296 2254.296 2254.296 2254.296 2254.296

Also I have used the approx function, but it does not work for the new
volume, too.

> a = x6[,1]
> b = x6[,4]
> estimate <- 3,000,000,000
> appro <- approx(b,a, xout = estimate)
> appro
$x
[1] 3e+09

$y
[1] NA

I do not know why it has happened.

Is there any way to do this?
Or maybe there is another way to do that.
I would be more than happy if anyone help me.

Sincerely

1. You should regress Elevation on Volume, no?

2. You are calling lm incorrectly for prediction. Please read ?lm and
related links carefully and/or consult a tutorial. R-Help is really not the
first place you should look for this sort of detailed info.

3. I think this is what you want:

lm1 <- lm(Elevation ~ Vol, data = x6)  ## assuming (1) above is correct
d <- data.frame(Vol = 3000)  ## assuming (1) above is correct
predict(lm1, newdata = d)

> My problem is how to replicate the Eliminate function in R.

While R does invite the user to "compute on the language", i.e. take R
expressions and function calls and work with them as with ordinary
variables [*], so far nobody wrote a complete computer algebra system in
R. Interfaces for other CASes do exist, but I haven't tried them.

> Or is it possible to solely solve the system numerically?

While it's less efficient to do so, it must be possible. For example,
the https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=nleqslv package does exactly
that.

> h0 = h + hd + hg,
> d0 = d + hd,
> ga0 = ga + hg,
> kga = hg/(h*ga),
> kd = hd/(h*d)
 
> The aim is to fit a non-linear equation in the form: signal ~ I0 +
> IHD * hd + ID * d.

> The parameters which should be identified/optimized are: I0, ID, IHD
> and kd. However, the only information known is kga (33600.0), h0 
> (0.0000208), d0 (0.000079) and the guest concentration (= ga0).

This doesn't quite agree with

> 0 = h + hd + hga,
> 33600. = d + hd,
> 0.000079 = hga/(ga*h),

...that you gave to Mathematica. Is it d0 = d + hd or kga = 33600. = d +
hd? kga = hg/(h*ga) or d0 = 0.000079 = hga/(ga*h)? What other equations
are missing?

The general approach is to take all the equations and write them down
as a vector of expressions that should be evaluate to 0 at solution,
then substitute() in the values of the constants and x[i] for
sequential values of `i` for variables:

fn <- function(x) NULL
body(fn) <- substitute(
 c( # equations go here
  h0  - h + hd + hg,
  d0  - d + hd,
  ga0 - ga + hg,
  kga - hg/(h*ga),
  kd  - hd/(h*d),
  # ...more equations...
  signal - I0 + IHD * hd + ID * d
 ),
 list(
  # knowns
  kga = 33600.0,
  h0 = 0.0000208,
  d0 = 0.000079,
  # assuming two more knowns live in same-named variables
  ga0 = ga0,
  signal = signal,
  # variables named so far
  I0 = quote(x[1]), ID = quote(x[2]),
  IHD = quote(x[3]), kd = quote(x[4])
  # ...more variables...
 )
)

The resulting function fn() takes a vector of variables and should
return a vector of zeroes at the solution. Try to solve it using
nleqslv::nleqslv(starting_guess, fn) or some of the functions from the
BB package.

Subject: [R] reshape() not dropping varaibles
Message-ID: <CAN-Z0xX0ouaS3Njh12K6GVdxZ2j7vOnA8+Wb_yrAVtv=UYnrUA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all!

I1m trying to re-format some data from long to wide format with reshape().
Specifically, the data has SURVEYDATE, which I want to be in the rows, and
COMMON_NAME which should be the columns. The entries should be TOTAL_CATCH.
The data has a bunch of other variables, which can be ignored.

When I run reshape(), it includes all of the variables, not just
TOTAL_CATCH:

Data <- read.csv("
https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/227105/fish_data_raw.csv?sequence=6&isAllowed=y
")
Data.wide <- reshape(Data, direction = "wide",
                idvar = "SURVEYDATE", timevar = "COMMON_NAME",
                v.names = "TOTAL_CATCH")
names(Data.wide)

I tried with the example on the help page, which works fine:

# this works
Indometh$thing <- 1:nrow(Indometh)
wide <- reshape(Indometh, direction = "wide", idvar = "Subject",
                timevar = "time", v.names = "conc", sep= "_")
names(wide)

There are some obvious work-arounds and alternatives, but it would be nice
to have this sorted. Can anyone help?

Posting a few rows, say 5, of your data using dput() along with the result
that you would like to get for those rows would help get you a quicker and
more accurate response, I believe. This is as suggested by the posting
guide, linked below, which you should read if you have not already.

It would be nice to see what OP wanted to end up with, but the link contained input data to experiment with.

The first problem is that if you are not interested in working with the whole set of columns then you need to only give a data frame with the columns you want to work with:

dta.wide <- reshape(
  Data[, c( "SURVEYDATE", "COMMON_NAME", "TOTAL_CATCH" ) ]
  , direction = "wide"
  , idvar = "SURVEYDATE"
  , timevar = "COMMON_NAME"
  , v.names = "TOTAL_CATCH"
)

Second, there are multiple rows of TOTAL_CATCH for each combination of SURVEYDATE and COMMON_NAME. reshape does not do math on the data... you have to resolve that yourself first by choosing how you want to turn a bunch of numbers into one... in this case I chose to sum them up:

Data.agg <- aggregate(
  TOTAL_CATCH ~ SURVEYDATE + COMMON_NAME
  , data = Data
  , FUN = sum
)
# the aggregate calculation implicitly leaves out columns you don't specify

dta.wide <- reshape(
  Data.agg
  , direction = "wide"
  , idvar = "SURVEYDATE"
  , timevar = "COMMON_NAME"
  , v.names = "TOTAL_CATCH"
)
Data.wide

Hello,

I don't see a reason why year should be a factor and the formula in 
geom_smooth is wrong, it should be y ~ x, the aesthetics envolved.
It still doesn't plot the CI's though. There's a warning and I am not 
understanding where it comes from. But the regression line is plotted.



ggplot(df, aes(x = as.numeric(year), y = score)) +
   geom_point() +
   geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x) +
   labs(
     title = "Standard linear regression for France",
     x = "Year",
     y = "PISA score in mathematics"
   ) +
   ylim(470, 500)
#> Warning message:
#> In max(ids, na.rm = TRUE) : no non-missing arguments to max; 
returning -Inf



Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

This can easily be done using predict.lm to get the intervals (confidence
or prediction).
?predict.lm contains a plotting example using ?matplot from the graphics
package. Here's a somewhat verbose version for your example (first
converting Year to numeric, of course):

df=data.frame(year= c(2012,2015,2018,2022), score=c(495,493, 495, 474))

fitted <- lm(score ~ year, data = df)
with(df,
   matplot(x = year, y = cbind(score,predict(fitted,interval = 'conf',
level = .95))
            ,type = c('p', rep('l',3))
            ,pch = 16
            ,lty = c('blank','solid', 'dashed','dashed') ## or use numeric
values of 0,1,2,2
            ,lwd = c(0,2,1,1)
            ,col = c('black','darkblue', 'red','red')
            ,xlab = 'Year'
            ,ylab = 'Data with Fitted Line and Conf Intervals'

   )
)

After playing with this for a little while, I realized that the problem 
with plotting the confidence limits is the addition of ylim(470, 500).? 
The confidence values are outside the ylim values.? Remove the limits, 
or increase the range, and the confidence curves will plot.

Hope this is helpful,

Dan

Hello, all,

[Originally sent to r-sig-geo list, with no response. Cross-posting
here, in the hope of a wider audience. Anyone with any experience in
this topic? Thanks.]

I'm trying to get started analyzing the concentrations of smokestack
emissions. I don't have any professional background or training for
this; I'm just an old, retired guy who thinks playing with numbers is
fun.

A local funeral home in my neighborhood (less than 1200 ft from my
home) is proposing to construct a crematorium for human remains. I have
some experience with the tidycensus package and thought it might be
interesting to construct a model for the changes in concentrations of
the pollutants from the smokestack and, using recorded wind speeds and
directions, see which US Census blocks would be affected.

I have the US Government EPA SCREEN3 output on how concentration varies
with distance from the smokestack.
See?https://www.epa.gov/scram/air-quality-dispersion-modeling-screening-models#screen3
if curious. As a first task, I'd like to see if I can calculate similar
results in R. I'm aware of the 'plume' steady-state Gaussian dispersion
package
(https://rdrr.io/github/holstius/plume/f/inst/doc/plume-intro.pdf), but
am a little concerned that this package was last updated 11 years ago.

Do you have any recommendations for me on how to get started analyzing
this problem? Is 'plume' still the way to go? I'm aware that there are
many atmospheric dispersion models from the US EPA, but I was hoping to
keep my work within R, which I'm really enjoying using and learning
about. Are SCREEN3 and 'plume' comparable? Is this the best R list to
ask questions about this topic?

Thanks for any advice or guidance you have for me.

-Kevin

You might also try the R-Sig-ecology list, though I would agree that it's
not clearly related. Still, air pollution effects...?

Dear Ben,
Dear Daniel,
Dear Rui,
Dear Bert,

Here below my R code.
I really appreciate all your comments. My R code is perfectly working but there is still something I would like to improve. The X-axis is showing ? 2012.5 ; ? 2015.0 ? ; ? 2017.5 ? ; ?2020.0
I would like to see on X-axis only the year (2012 ; 2015 ; 2017 ; 2020). How to do??

library(ggplot2)
?
df=data.frame(year= c(2012,2015,2018,2022), score=c(495,493, 495, 474))

ggplot(df, aes(x = year, y = score)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x) +
?labs(title = "Standard linear regression for France", x = "Year", y = "PISA score in mathematics") + scale_y_continuous(limits=c(470,500),oob=scales::squish)

coord_cartesian also seems to work for y, and including the breaks = .? 
How about:

df=data.frame(year= c(2012,2015,2018,2022),
 ????????????? score=c(495,493, 495, 474))

ggplot(df, aes(x = year, y = score)) +
 ? geom_point() +
 ? geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x) +
 ? labs(title = "Standard linear regression for France", x = "Year", y = 
"PISA score in mathematics") +
 ? coord_cartesian(ylim=c(470,500)) +
 ? scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2012:2022)

Change year to a factor. Doing it in ggplot will not change the original data.

ggplot(df, aes(x = as.factor(year), y = score)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x) +  labs(title = "Standard linear regression for France", x = "Year", y = "PISA score in mathematics") +
scale_y_continuous(limits=c(470,500),oob=scales::squish)

Dear Ben,
Dear Daniel,
Dear Rui,
Dear Bert,

Here below my R code.
I really appreciate all your comments. My R code is perfectly working but there is still something I would like to improve. The X-axis is showing   2012.5 ;   2015.0   ;   2017.5   ;  2020.0
I would like to see on X-axis only the year (2012 ; 2015 ; 2017 ; 2020). How to do?

library(ggplot2)

df=data.frame(year= c(2012,2015,2018,2022), score=c(495,493, 495, 474))

That depends on how exactly everything must match your primary question. The ecology group might be helpful for how biodiversity changes with proximity to a smokestack. They might have a better idea if the smokestack was from a coal fired powerplant or oil refinery. The modeling process would be similar, though the abundance of individual contaminants would be quite different. Just my thought for what it is worth.

You might also try the R-Sig-ecology list, though I would agree that it's not clearly related. Still, air pollution effects...?

My point was only that there might be functionality there that might be
relevant to his concerns. .. with help on how to use it.

Hello,

In the code below I don't use coord_cartesian because to set ylim will 
cut part of the confidence intervals.

To have labels only in the years present in the data set, get them from 
the data.



library(ggplot2)

df <- data.frame(year= c(2012,2015,2018,2022),
                  score=c(495,493, 495, 474))

# in this case unique is not needed, it's here
# because it might with some data sets
brks_year <- df$year # |> unique()

ggplot(df, aes(x = year, y = score)) +
   geom_point() +
   geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x) +
   labs(title = "Standard linear regression for France",
        x = "Year", y = "PISA score in mathematics") +
   scale_x_continuous(breaks = brks_year)



Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] simtrial: Clinical Trial Simulation
Message-ID: <79834370-a2ad-4a6a-8b55-19b29e998f8a@app.fastmail.com>

Dear all,

I am happy to announce that {simtrial} is now on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=simtrial). simtrial is a fast and extensible clinical trial simulation framework for time-to-event endpoints.

This release brings a new tabular data processing engine powered by data.table for 3x to 5x faster simulations, a new parallelization adaptor with %dofuture%, a refreshed API that aligns with the gsDesign2 style guide, and new functions for zero early weight and analysis date. For a summary of the updates, please see the announcement: https://keaven.github.io/blog/simtrial-0-3-2/.

I hope you find simtrial helpful. Please feel free to reach out with feedback or questions.

Best regards,
-Nan
