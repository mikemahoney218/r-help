Subject: [R]  Quantiles and QQ plots
Message-ID: <14097909.post@talk.nabble.com>


I have 20 variables:

5,9,6,1,5,9,7,4,5,6,3,2,4,8,9,6,1,8,4,8

How do I calculate the corresponding quantiles from a normal distribution
with the same mean and variance as the sample?

Also, how do I draw a QQ plot of the data?

Thanks for any help!

If you are just going to have 3 values for coloring, then you could
just convert your data into 1, 2, 3:

new.data <- ifelse(old.data > 2, 3, ifelse(old.data < 2, 1, 2))
dim(new.data) <- dim(old.data)

and then plot it.

Try this.  This will plot a similar scale for data.

require(lattice)
# generate some data
x <- matrix(sample(0:8,100,replace=TRUE),10) # create 9 value
# create a color palette for outpu
Lab.palette <- colorRampPalette(c("red", 'yellow','green','blue'))
levelplot(x,col.regions=Lab.palette(10))

I was just using colorRampPalette to generate a range of color.  You might try:

 Lab.palette <- colorRampPalette(c("dark red", "yellow", "dark green"))

to see if this is closer.  You can use the palette in other plot
functions; this was just the easiest to show what was happening.

Sorry about that, it was sent by accident.

I have a data frame that looks something like this:

   id day    k
  56  -1  566
  63  -1  680
  73  -1  773
  56   2  298
  63   2  273
  
    Of course, it is a very simplified version of the
real data frame I am working on. I need to add another
column that would represent a percent change in k from
day -1, by id. I put only two ids at day 2 to
emphasize the fact that after day -1 some subjects
won't be on the data frame any more.

I tried something like this:

pck<-by(dat,dat[,c("id","day")], function(x) {
      pc<-((x$k-x$k[x$day==-1])/x$k[x$day==-1])*100
      })
but it didn't work. 

Then I tried:

for(i in dat$id) {

    for(s in dat$day) {
        pc<-((dat$k[dat$id==i &
dat$day==s]-dat$k[dat$id==i &
dat$day==-1])/dat$k[dat$id==i & dat$day==-1])*100
}
}
without success.

I am sure it is very simple to do, but I would
appreciate any hints.

Thank you,

Judith

Assuming that there is a -1 day for every day
in the data frame and all the -1 days are at
the beginning, try this where k[match(id, id)]
is the vector of corresponding day -1 k-values:

DF <- data.frame(id = c(56, 63, 73, 56, 63),
	day = c(-1, -1, -1, 2, 2),
	k = c(566, 680, 773, 298, 273))

transform(DF, percent = 100 * k / k[match(id, id)] - 100)

Also, please use meaningful subject headings so
that future persons having the same problem can
more easily locate it in the archive.

Your vector:

x=c(5,9,6,1,5,9,7,4,5,6,3,2,4,8,9,6,1,8,4,8)

Check descriptives:

mean(x)
sd(x)

get quantiles for a normal with mean and standard deviation of x:

qnorm(c(0.25,0.5,0.75),mean=mean(x),sd=sd(x))

Output:

[1] 3.76997 5.50000 7.23003

to get the quantile plot install library "car" and load library by typing in
the R prompt: library(car) 

qq.plot(x)

But you can easily look at the histogram of your vector - hist(x) - to see
that this does not look very normal

Betreff: [R] Quantiles and QQ plots


I have 20 variables:

5,9,6,1,5,9,7,4,5,6,3,2,4,8,9,6,1,8,4,8

How do I calculate the corresponding quantiles from a normal distribution
with the same mean and variance as the sample?

Also, how do I draw a QQ plot of the data?

Thanks for any help!

Just found out that I am actually dealing with factors:
> t3[1,5] == t3[1,3]
Error in Ops.factor(t3[1, 5], t3[1, 3]) : level sets of factors are
different

But the problem remains... how can I compare them?

Thanks,

Bernd

It helps writing down these question, you are then getting much closer to an
answer...

summary(as.integer(t3[,2]) == as.integer(t3[,4]) & as.integer(t3[,3]) ==
as.integer(t3[,5]))

will compare two pairs of column pairs and give a count of flase and true
rows...

below assumes that there are only 2 columns in
the dataframe or that the string columns are the 
first two columns ? 

which(df[,1] == df[,2])

Here's how to generate a million

psample <- rpois(1000000, lambda = 20)

so guess how you would generate one.

The main point is that if you really want to generate more than one, do
it all at once like the above, do not do it in a loop.

Well, you can do it:

assign(paste("myname", name[1], sep = "."), seq(1:10))

but this looks clumsy to me, as if you were trying to make R do
something the same way that you do things in some other system.  This is
nearly always a bad idea. My advice is to learn how to do things the R
way.

Hello,

I have got a vector, for example seq(1:10), and I have an array "name"
defined before which contain the vector name I would like to use. So
name[1]= "price". I would like to name the vector in the following
codes:

paste("myname", name[1]) <- seq(1:10)

But it does not work. Could anyone give me some advice? Many thanks.

I have 20 variables:

5,9,6,1,5,9,7,4,5,6,3,2,4,8,9,6,1,8,4,8

[WNV] I think you have 20 values, not variables.


How do I calculate the corresponding quantiles from a normal
distribution
with the same mean and variance as the sample?


[WNV] There is some ambiguity about this, but a simple way to do it
would be

x <- c(5,9,6,1,5,9,7,4,5,6,3,2,4,8,9,6,1,8,4,8)
n <- length(x)
p <- (1:n - 0.5)/n
z <- qnorm(p, mean(x), sd(x))[order(order(x))]




Also, how do I draw a QQ plot of the data?

[WNV] having done all this you can now just

plot(z, x)

but a much simpler way is

qqnorm(x)
qqline(x)

and don't bother calculating all that stuff!

Thanks for any help!

This seems a little impractical to me.  People respond so much at random
and most only tackle questions with which they feel comfortable.  As
it's not a competition in any sense, it's going to be hard to rank
people in any effective way.  But suppose you succeed in doing so, then
what?

To me a much more urgent initiative is some kind of user online review
system for packages, even something as simple as that used by Amazon.com
has for customer review of books.

I think the need for this is rather urgent, in fact.  Most packages are
very good, but I regret to say some are pretty inefficient and others
downright dangerous.  You don't want to discourage people from
submitting their work to CRAN, but at the same time you do want some
mechanism that allows users to relate their experience with it, good or
bad.

Sent: Saturday, 1 December 2007 6:13 AM
To: R Help
Subject: [R] Rating R Helpers

Since R is open source and help may come from varied levels of
experience on R-Help, I wonder if it might be helpful to construct a
method that can be used to "rate" those who provide help on this list.

This is something that is done on other comp lists, like
http://www.experts-exchange.com/.

I think some of the reasons for this are pretty transparent, but I
suppose one reason is that one could decide to implement the advise of
those with "superior" or "expert" levels. In other words, you can trust
the advice of someone who is more experienced more than someone who is
not. Currently, there is no way to discern who on this list is really an
R expert and who is not. Of course, there is R core, but most people
don't actually know who these people are (at least I surmise that to be
true).

If this is potentially useful, maybe one way to begin the development of
such ratings is to allow the original poster to "rate" the level of help
from those who responded. Maybe something like a very simple
questionnaire on a likert-like scale that the original poster would
respond to upon receiving help which would lead to the accumulation of
points for the responders. Higher points would result in higher levels
of expertise (e.g., novice, ..., wizaRd).

Just a random thought. What do others think?

Harold

If they really are factors with different level sets, I think you might 
prefer as.character() there.

#Hi R-users,
#Suppose that I have a data.frame like this:

y1 <- rnorm(10) + 6.8
y2 <- rnorm(10) + (1:10*1.7 + 1)
y3 <- rnorm(10) + (1:10*6.7 + 3.7)
y <- c(y1,y2,y3)
x <- rep(1:3,10)
f <- gl(2,15, labels=paste("lev", 1:2, sep=""))
g <- seq(as.Date("2000/1/1"), by="day", length=30)
DF <- data.frame(x=x,y=y, f=f, g=g)
DF$g[DF$x == 1] <- NA
DF$x[3:6] <- NA
DF$wdays <- weekdays(DF$g)

DF

#For EDA purposes, I would like to calculate frequences in each variable
g <- lapply(DF, function(x) as.data.frame(table(x)))

#After this, I would like to cbind these data.frames (in g) into a
single data.frame (which to export to MS Excel)
#do.call(cbind, g) does not seem to work because of the different
number of rows in each data.frame.
#The resulting data.frame shoul look like this (only two variables
printed here):

Rowid;x;Freq.x;y;Freq.y; # etc...

You can get a very rough idea of this automatically by making a list of which
packages  are dependents of other packages.

library(pkgDepTools) # from BioC
AP <- available.packages()
dep <- AP[, "Depends"]
deps <- unlist(sapply(dep, pkgDepTools:::cleanPkgField))
sort(table(deps))

Of course some packages are more naturally end-user oriented and so
would never make such a list and others may be good but just no one
knows about them so they have never been used.   Some packages
might get on the list because an author has two packages and one uses
the other so an enhancement could be to eliminate dependencies with
a common author.

The help file does say that for a generalized linear mixed model
(GLMM), which is what family = binomial implies, the estimation
criterion is always "ML" (maximum likelihood) as opposed to "REML"
(restricted, or residual, maximum likelihood).  So stating method =
"ML" is redundant.

For a GLMM, however, the log-likelihood cannot not be evaluated
directly and must be approximated.  Here the help file is misleading
because it implies that there are three possible approximations, "PQL"
(penalized quasi-likelihood), "Laplace" and "AGQ" (adaptive Gaussian
quadrature).  AGQ has not yet been implemented so the only effective
choices are PQL and Laplace.  The default is PQL, to refine the
starting estimates, followed by optimization of the Laplace
approximation.  In some cases it is an advantage to suppress the PQL
iterations which can be done with one of the settings for the control
argument.

I forgot to mention that the correlation argument has no effect in
this call.  That argument is for the lme function in the nlme package.
 In lmer it is ignored.

I had found out the hard way that it is often better to let PQL 
play the game rather loosely.  Yet I never dared to tell someone, for fear
the approximation could end up in the wrong slot,

Any rules (beside trying variants) if I can trust such a result?

Message-ID: <fis13u$45q$1@ger.gmane.org>

I have been using Aspell on a Linux system, but it doesn't
understand the noweb chunks, which I'd rather it not spellcheck. I
can run it on the generated .tex files, but then changes I make
during the spellcheck will not be propagated back to the original
source. Any suggestions on how to spellcheck Sweave documents?

I see from a search that some people seem to be trying Flyspell on 
Emacs. I'd rather have a solution that runs outside of Emacs, but if 
anyone is using Flyspell successfully, I'd love to know of their 
experiences.

Message-ID: <f6d5b6a20712010826t760a3e08hf0b1d046c13251b2@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I encountered this problem when I was looking around in R, by default
R is built with --enable-mcfs and when I tried to edit any data I was
getting:

dataentry(datalist, modes) : invalid device
unable to create fontset -*-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

anyway I looked around code, noticed that it comes from fragment when
SUPPORT_MCFS is defined, and decided to try my luck without it,
rebuild with:

--disable-mfcs

and it worked like a charm, just doesn't have UTF-8 support now of
course what would be nice... am I missing something? I googled and
searched and found one similar message, but then it was stated it
works with current versions... my fonts in xorg.conf points to right
directories in my system and all other apps works. I run current
version of Arch linux

I would appreciate any help or hints how to solve that - whatever this
is bug or misconfiguration :)
thanks in advance,
Andrzej Giniewicz.

Why exactly the same question?

You were told what to do.
I am new to R. I did what the previous poster said.
I found it. Write your function in terms of vector operations. Avoid  
loops if you can.

Sample input for R follows
-------------------------

# par is the thing that has to be found
# x are the observations

f  <- function(par,x) sum(2*(x-par)/(1+(x-par)^2))

# trial stuff

x  <- 1:10

# use uniroot to find a value for par such that f(par,x) == 0
# interval for par is obvious (lower=1 and upper=10)

paropt  <- uniroot(f,c(1,10),tol=1e-8,x)

paropt
<END OF SAMPLEINPUT>

It works.

Subject: [R] R function for percentrank

I don't see one but that means nothing.   I think you
can write such a function in a few minutes

Will something like this work or am I
missunderstanding what Excel's percentrank does ?

aa <- rnorm(25);  aa  # data vector 
percentrank <- function(x) { 
var  <- sort(x)
p.rank <- 1:length(var)/length(var)*100
dd  <- cbind(var,p.rank)
}
pr <- percentrank(aa); pr

I don't think r-help is really intended for packages although for some
very popular packages questions appear on it anyways sometimes.

Not in the <<>>, but you could set a hook for fig:


>From Sweave docs:

If option "SweaveHooks" is defined as list(fig = foo), and foo is a function,
then it would be executed before the code in each figure chunk. This is
especially useful to set defaults for the graphical parameters in a series of
figure chunks.

I'm not sure I understand the sense of your first statement.  Do you
mean that you have found that you should use PQL or you should not use
PQL?

I would advise using the Laplace approximation for the final
estimates.  At one time I thought it would be much slower than the PQL
iterations but it doesn't seem to be that bad.

I also thought that PQL would refine the starting estimates in the
sense that it would take comparatively crude starting values and get
you much closer to the optimum before you switched to Laplace.
However, because PQL is an algorithm that iterates on both the fixed
effects and the random effects with fixed weights, then updates the
weights, then goes back to the fixed effects and random effects, etc.
there is a possibility that the early weights can force poor values of
the fixed effects and later iterations do not recover.

I tend to prefer the Laplace approximation directly without any PQL
iterations.  That is

 method = "Laplace", control = list(usePQL = FALSE)

I would be interested in learning what experiences you or others have
had with the different approaches.

I am cc:ing this to the R-SIG-mixed-models list and suggest we switch
to that list only for further discussion.

Subject: [R]  Need help on changing a table
Message-ID: <14107837.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hi all:
Im kind of new on R and I need help changing a table. The thing is, i read a
file on R using the read.table command and the table looks like this:
Item      3d Plot     XY plot    
001          1             0            
001          0             1            
001          0             1      
002          1             0
002          1             0
002          0             1
...            ..             ..
And what I want to do is generate a new table by item with the sum of the
numbres, the next one is an example:

Item     3d Plot       XY plot
001          1              2
002          2              1
003          ...            ...

Does anyone know how to do this? Thanks in advance, help is greatly
appreciated

Note that read.table() reads a table and returns a _data frame_.  So it is 
the _data frame_ that you want to change (a table is something else in R). 
This is a simple application of aggregate(), e.g.

> aggregate(z[-1], list(Item=z$Item), sum)
   Item X3d_Plot XY_plot
1    1        1       2
2    2        2       1

where I got z from read.table("clipboard", header=TRUE).

My nomination for a function with a similar result would be ecdf(), the 
empirical cumulative distribution function. It is of class "function" so 
efforts to index ecdf(.)[.] failed for me.

[1] 1 1 1 1 1 5 6 7 9

Don't have Excel, but the OpenOffice.org Calc program has the same 
function. It produces:
x    percentrank(x)
1	0.0000000
1	0.0000000
3	0.2222222
3	0.2222222
4	0.4444444
5	0.5555556
6	0.6666667
7	0.7777778
10	1.0000000
9	0.8888889

(Not that I am saying that the OO.o/Excel function is what one _should_ 
want. Its behavior seems pathological to me.)

If you want the concordance between the lines in the original file and 
those in the .tex file, you can get it (with the concordance=TRUE Sweave 
option).  Then it would be theoretically possible to convert reports 
about errors in the .tex into reports about the .Rnw.  I don't know if 
Aspell provides information in a form where you could actually make use 
of this, but if so, it might be a nice contribution to do so.

(For sample code decoding the concordance, see my patchDVI package:  it 
converts source links in .dvi files to point to the .Rnw instead of the 
.tex file.)

You can use ls.str() to look into the function environment:

> ls.str(environment(ecdf(x)))
f :  num 0
method :  int 2
n :  int 25
x :  num [1:25] -2.215 -1.989 -0.836 -0.820 -0.626 ...
y :  num [1:25] 0.04 0.08 0.12 0.16 0.2 0.24 0.28 0.32 0.36 0.4 ...
yleft :  num 0
yright :  num 1



You can then use get() or mget() within the function environment to
return the requisite values. Something along the lines of the following
within the function percentrank():

percentrank <- function(x, val)
{
  env.x <- environment(ecdf(x))
  res <- mget(c("x", "y"), env.x)
  Ind <- which(sapply(seq(length(res$x)),
                      function(i) isTRUE(all.equal(res$x[i], val))))
  res$y[Ind]
}


Thus:

set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(25)

> x
 [1] -0.62645381  0.18364332 -0.83562861  1.59528080  0.32950777

One other approach, which returns the values and their respective rank
percentiles is:

Thanks. I guess what I really want to do is switch between one of two 
settings. Only one value can be in the defaults, and I would like some 
way of setting the other value. This might not be easily possible, but I 
thought I would ask.

Excel

1	0
1	0
3	0.222
3	0.222
4	0.444
5	0.555
6	0.666
7	0.777
10	1

It seems that OOo is following Excel's distinguished
footsteps. 

How can one have a 0 percentile ranking?

Its a bit tricky if you want to get it to work exactly the same as
Excel even in the presence of runs but in terms of the R approx function
I think percentrank corresponds to ties = "min" if the value is among those
in the table and ties = "ordered" otherwise so:

percentrank <- function(table, x = table) {
   table <- sort(table)
   ties <- ifelse(match(x, table, nomatch = 0), "min", "ordered")
   len <- length(table)
   f <- function(x, ties)
      (approx(table, seq(0, len = len), x, ties = ties)$y) / (len - 1)
   mapply(f, x, ties)
}

# test
tab <- c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3)
percentrank(tab, 2:6/2) # c(0, .3, .4, .7, .8)

which is the same result as Excel 2007 gives.

That's no table that's a data.frame :). 

For what you want probably the easiest way is 
aggregate.  Type ?aggregate for the help information

Based on your example and assuming the data is called
"mydata" this shold do what you want.


aggregate(mydata[,2:3], by=list(item=mydata$Item),
sum)

Hrm. I find tags immensely useful for entities which do not contain primarily
text, such as photos. I am at doubt how keywords are important when they are
not found in the text. There are situations where the first keyword that comes
to mind is tiptoed around in the message, but I don't know if this is often
the case.

Is it a problem of way too many false positives or a problem of false negatives?
Tags may help out in the second case, but in my experiencd it is rare.

Do you think that people who keep asking similar questions do so because they
didn't do their homework first, or that they Googled and failed?

Subject: [R] Specify var-covar matrix in mixed linear model using lme?
Message-ID: <583792.43610.qm@web33202.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,All:
I have a question about specifying var-cov matrix in
mixed linear model using lme. For example, for
single-level mixed linear model:
yi = XiB + Ziui + ei
ui ~ N(0,D), ei ~ N(0,sigma^2R),
var(yi)=sigma^2(ZiAZi^T + R). R is an identify matrix
and A is a known var-covar matrix in my data.
In my data, there is only one random effect besides
ei. But this random effect is dependent among
different subjects within group (this dependence is
characterized in A which is known). corStruct class in
nlme can specify correlation structure for within
group errors (that is, specify R for ei). But I don't
know how to specify A for a specific random effect. In
other words, I want to fix matrix A in the analysis. 
Thanks a lot for your help.

Just adjust the formula for Qtr appropriately if your quarters
are not Jan/Feb/Mar, Apr/May/Jun, Jul/Aug/Sep, Oct/Nov/Dec
as I assumed.

Part of the problem is that you seem to have two names for the same 
variable in your code (Standard.Deviance and Standard.Deviation - unless 
that was a typo). Notice how I calculate the colors twice, the second 
time with a simple integer sequence to get the right number of evenly 
spaced colors. In your example, you calculated the colors for 
RankVar$Standard.Deviance again, but you don't need all those colors for 
the legend, and they're in the wrong order anyway. What is generally 
wanted for a color legend is the minimum and maximum values on the ends 
and a few linear interpolations in the middle.

barplot(RankVar$MeanDecreaseAccuracy,
  col=color.scale(RankVar$Standard.Deviance,
  c(0,1,1),c(1,1,0),0),
  ylab = "Variable Importance",
  names.arg = rownames(RankVar),
  cex.names = .7,
  main = "Variables from RandomFishForest",
  sub= "Mean Decrease in Accuracy")
col.labels<- c("Low","Mid","High")
color.legend(6,13,11,14,col.labels,
  rect.col=color.scale(1:5,c(0,1,1),c(1,1,0),0))

Message-ID: <200712021649.lB2GnfCx030277@mc-pc.research.telcordia.com>

Version: 2.5.1

array() is inconsistent when given non-integral dimensions:

> zz <- array(0,dim=c(4,3.01))
> dim(zz)
[1] 4 3
> zz <- array(0,dim=c(201,4.05))
Error in dim(data) <- dim : dim<- : dims [product 804] do not match the length of object [814]


[IMHO the code that did this is broken.  My copy of it has been
fixed.  Consistent behavior and/or a clearer error message would
just have made it easier to find the problem.]

Subject: [R] speeding up likelihood computation
Message-ID: <110f9d445.d445110f9@osu.edu>

R Users:

I am trying to estimate a model of fertility behaviour using birth history data with maximum likelihood. My code works but is extremely slow (because of several for loops and my programming inefficiencies); when I use the genetic algorithm to optimize the likelihood function, it takes several days to complete (on a machine with Intel Core 2 processor [2.66GHz] and 2.99 GB RAM). Computing the hessian and using it to calculate the standard errors takes a large chunk of this time. 

I am copying the code for my likelihood function below; it would be great if someone could suggest any method to speed up the code (by avoiding the for loops or by any other method).

I am not providing details of my model or what exactly I am trying to do in each step of the computation below; i would be happy to provide these details if they are deemed necessary for re-working the code.

Thanks.
Deepankar

That's an obsolete version, but the issue is still present in R-devel.

I'll add code to coerce dim to integer before using it.  Thanks for the

  While you're at it could you fix a trivial typo in ?dim   ?

  in the description of the value argument: "... or a numeric
vector which [is] coerced ..."
 (I would also say that either there should be a comma after
"vector" or "which" should be changed to "that", but never mind ...)

Not so:

> sapply(DF, class)
           x           y           f           g       wdays
   "integer"   "numeric"    "factor"      "Date" "character"

and DF$f does not have any NA levels.

The place you may think you have got NAs is in format(wdays):
they are not NA nor "NA" but "NA     ".  I am not sure what exactly you 
want (NA is not appearing in the tables: see the 'exclude' argument),
but perhaps

lapply(DF, function(x) {
   if(is.character(x)) x[is.na(x)] <- "missing"
   as.data.frame(table(format(x)))
})

or

lapply(DF, function(x) {
   z <- table(format(x))
   names(z)[grep("^NA", names(z))] <- "missing"
   as.data.frame(z)
})

or

lapply(DF, function(x) {
   z <- table(x, exclude=character(0))
   names(z)[is.na(names(z))] <- "missing"
   as.data.frame(z)
})

?

Check out the paper argument to the postscript device.  I think you'll
be more sucessful.

Subject: [R] error messgage in lmer for random intercept and slope model
Message-ID: <000c01c83518$706343e0$0301a8c0@dell001>

Greetings,

I am trying to run a logistic regression model for binary data with a random
intercept and slope in R 2.6.1.  When I use the code:

lmer1<-lmer(infect ~  time+gender + (1+time|id), family=binomial, data=ichs,
method="Laplace")

Then from:
 summary(lmer1)
I get the message:

Error in if (any(sd < 0)) return("'sd' slot has negative entries") :
  missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed

The model with just a random intercept has no difficulty.  That is the
model:

lmer1<-lmer(infect ~  time+gender + (1|id), family=binomial, data=ichs,
method="Laplace")

yields no such message.  Can someone please tell me what this is about?

Thank you,

Rule number 1:  Read the help for the function you are using.
You must supply starting values for the fit --- which the code you gave
doesn't do.

Rule number 2:  Don't use nls()!  Endless grief results.

Instead try:

foo <- function(par,x,y){
  Const <- par[1]
  B <- par[2]
  A <- par[3]
  sum((y-(Const+B*(x^A)))^2)
  }

fit <- optim(c 
(1,2.5,0.2),foo,x=area,y=richness,method="BFGS",control=list 
(maxit=1000))

plot(area,richness)
ccc <- fit$par
curve(ccc[1]+ccc[2]*(x^ccc[3]),from=0,to=2000,add=TRUE,col="red") #  
Fit doesn't look too bad.

HTH.

I think "which" is correct and have added a comma.

Right, also still there in R-devel.  It's just a typo, which I'll fix.

It seems I didn't get by with your previous solutions after all... I
would still need some more advice on the subject. I edited the DF so
that now all variables contain missing values (NAs).

y1 <- rnorm(10) + 6.8
y2 <- rnorm(10) + (1:10*1.7 + 1)
y3 <- rnorm(10) + (1:10*6.7 + 3.7)
y <- c(y1,y2,y3)
x <- rep(1:3,10)
f <- gl(2,15, labels=paste("lev", 1:2, sep=""))
g <- seq(as.Date("2000/1/1"), by="day", length=30)
DF <- data.frame(x=x,y=y, f=f, g=g)
DF$g[DF$x == 1] <- NA
DF$x[3:6] <- NA
DF$y[1] <- NA
DF$f[1] <- NA
DF$wdays <- weekdays(DF$g)

DF

Is it possible to create a function using the lapply function that
would produce those frequency data.frames into a list and replace all
NAs with the word "missing" in all these variables (which have a
different class)?

> sapply(DF, class)
          x           y           f           g       wdays
  "integer"   "numeric"    "factor"      "Date" "character"

Really appreciate the help,

Lauri

for easier notation, let y=richness, x=area, C=const in the following.

then 

nls(y~B*x^A + C, start = c(A=3.2, B=0.002, C=0))

converges alright. where's the problem (apart from this being not a very good
model for the data)? the critical point is to provide some reasonable estimate
of the parameters as starting values.

to get reasonable start values, I'd use:


y = B*x^A + C --> log(y-C) = log(B) + A*log(x) --> ly = b + a*lx,

estimate C from the x -> 0 asymptotic value (approx. 0)

and use lm(ly~lx) which yields a and b estimates which you could use in `nls'.

and, contrary to other assessments you've received, I definitely would prefer `nls'
for least squares fitting instead of using `optim' or other general minimization routines.

Is that really the model we want?  When we have problems sometimes
its just a sign that the model is not very good in the first place.

plot(richness ~ area)

shows most of the points crowded the left and just a few points out to
the right.  This
does not seem like a very good pattern for model fitting.

plot(richness ~ log(area))
plot(log(richness) ~ log(area))

both look nicer.

Subject: [R] problem installing 2.6.1 on OSX Leopard (after failed MacPorts
 install)
Message-ID: <14119813.post@talk.nabble.com>


This message reports a problem, and its solution.  I found the solution while
posting.  Since others may have the same problem, I am continuing with the
post.

PROBLEM
I am having a different problem than the one that others have reported (e.g.
http://www.nabble.com/Problem-Installing-2.6.0-on-Mac-tf4778736.html#a13674247).

Whether I try to install R as a whole, or individual packages, the installer
has a problem near the end.  The message is as follows.

<pre>Install Failed

The Installer could not install some files in "/".
Contact the software manager for assistance.</pre>

I looked at the installer script and found the error message as follows.
<pre>
Dec  2 16:14:40 Macintosh pkgExtractor[5356]: BomFileError 62: Too many
levels of symbolic links - ///usr/local/lib
</pre>

SOLUTION

A quick check shows that, indeed,

/usr/local/lib

is messed up.  It is an infinite link to itself.  But, another directory

/usr/local/lib 1

seems to be the original directory, that was moved aside by something.  (I
think that something was a failed installation of MacPorts, based on the
directory creation time, but that's onlly a guess.)

So, the workaround is to 

sudo rm /usr/local/lib

followed by 

sudo mv /usr/local/lib\ 1 /usr/local/lib

(Note the use of backslash to protect the space in the directory name.)

After this, I found that I can install the individual packages (gfortran
etc) or the whole R application, without problem.

Other information: I've recently upgraded from Tiger to Leopard.  There was
a pre-existing R on the system.

OK.  Since the model is linear except for A lets use brute force to
repeatedly evaluate the sum of squares for values of A between
-2 and 2 proceeding in steps of .01 solving the other parameters using
lm. That will give us better starting values and we should be able to
use nls on that.

> nls(richness ~ Const+B*(area^A), st = st)
Nonlinear regression model
  model:  richness ~ Const + B * (area^A)
   data:  parent.frame()
   Const        B        A
 33.9289 -33.4595  -0.4464
 residual sum-of-squares: 8751

Number of iterations to convergence: 2
Achieved convergence tolerance: 3.368e-06

Note that our A value is suspiciously close to A = -0.5 and sqrt(area)
is length so I wonder if there is an argument based on units of
measurement that might support a model of the form:

richness = Const + B / sqrt(area)

Clearly you are far cleverer than I at getting nls() to work.

I attempted to replicate your recipe ***exactly***, right down to the  
very last
detail of notation and the ordering of terms in the expression:

  > x <- area
  > y <- richness
  > ml2 <- nls(y ~ B*x^A + C,start=c(A=3.2,B=0.002,C=0))

and got the following error:

Error in nls(y ~ B * x^A + C, start = c(A = 3.2, B = 0.002, C = 0)) :
   singular gradient

Package review is a nice idea. But you raise a worrying point.
Are any of the 'downright dangerous' packages on CRAN?
If so, er... why?

Subject: [R] documenting yoru progress
Message-ID: <20071202232420.3348AFAC8C4@as220.org>


Hello all:

I have a function that writes a fairly elaborate report based on some
survey data.  For documentation and bookkeeping purposes, I'd like to
write out in the report the function call that produced the report, or
at least enough information to help me recreate the steps that led to
that report.  I've been generating all the reports with scripts, in
order to be able to recreate the steps, but apart from the file name, I
don't yet have a way to match the report to the script that created it.

Can anyone suggest easy ways to do this?  From within a function, is the
function call text available somehow, or the names of the arguments used
in the function invocation?

Many thanks,

 -tom

If what you mean is that you have a file, test.R, of R commands
and you are using source("test.R") and you wish to discover the
name "test.R" without hard coding it in your file, then place this in
test.R:

ofile <- parent.frame(2)$ofile

and ofile will be set to "test.R".  Note that the line shown should not
be within a function or other local environment within the file but
directly at top level.

This is hack which may need to be modified if the internals of the
source command change.

Thank you, that is an excellent hack, and I will use it carefully
(though often), but it isn't quite what I had in mind.

In my script called test.R, there is a function called "survey.write",
which writes a report based on some survey results.  It is called
several times at the top level.  I would like the report to say how
"survey.write" was invoked, whether it was invoked as
"survey.write(res.raw,res.q)" or "survey.write(bus.raw,bus.q)".
Obviously I have access to the values of the arguments, but I want the
names of those arguments, or a string containing it all.

Thanks,

 -tom

Try:
qqnorm(x); qqline(x, col = 2)

....as suggested in the examples in the help message from ?qqplot.

If you want the quantiles, invoking str(qqnorm(x)) suggests that the "x-
values" can be recovered by:

 qqnorm(x)$x

 ....and therefore the quantiles from:

pnorm(qqnorm(x)$x)

Subject: [R] plotting step functions in plot vs. xyplot
Message-ID: <3c5546140712021629t2ce52081l2ba64640c6e7a27b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have noticed an odd inconsistency when plotting a 'step' function
(type='s') in xyplot() vs. plot().

For example, given the following data:

## generate some profile depths: 0 - 150, in 10 cm increments
depth <- seq(0,150, by=10)
## generate some property: random numbers in this case
prop <- rnorm(n=length(depth), mean=15, sd=2)
## since the 0 is not a depth, and we would like the graph to start from 0
## make the first property row (associated with depth 0) the same as the second
## property row
prop[1] <- prop[2]
## combine into a table: data read in from a spread sheet would
already be in this format
soil <- data.frame(depth=depth, prop=prop)

## simple depth plot, as steps: looks good!
plot(depth ~ prop, data=soil, ylim=c(150,0), type='s', ylab='Depth',
xlab='Property', main='Property vs. Depth Plot')

## now try it with lattice graphics:yuck!
xyplot(depth ~ prop, data=soil, ylim=c(160,-5), type='s',
ylab='Depth', xlab='Property', main='Property vs. Depth Plot')

it looks like the data isn't rotated (?) correctly - i.e. the axis and
data do not match.

Now, am I mis-interpreting the meaning of type='s' in lattice graphics?

here is my R session info:
 sessionInfo()
R version 2.4.1 (2006-12-18)
i686-pc-linux-gnu

locale:
LC_CTYPE=en_US;LC_NUMERIC=C;LC_TIME=en_US;LC_COLLATE=en_US;LC_MONETARY=en_US;LC_MESSAGES=en_US;LC_PAPER=en_US;LC_NAME=C;LC_ADDRESS=C;LC_TELEPHONE=C;LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US;LC_IDENTIFICATION=C

attached base packages:
[1] "stats"     "graphics"  "grDevices" "utils"     "datasets"  "methods"
[7] "base"

other attached packages:
  lattice
"0.14-17"

could it be that my version of R and lattice is just too old?

thanks in advance!

Dylan

One thing that I would suggest that you do is to use Rprof on a subset
of the data that runs for 10-15 minutes and see where some of the hot
spots are.  Since you have not provided commented, minimal,
self-contained, reproducible code, it is hard to determine where the
inefficiencies are since we don't have any data to run against it.
Some of the loop look like you are just assigning a value to a vector,
e.g.,


>    if (alive[j]==N1) {
>
>        for (i in 1:(N1-1)) {
>                S[N1,i] <- (q^(nb[j]))*((1-q)^(ng[j]))

>                S[N1,i] <- 0
>        }
>
>    }

that can be done without loops, but without data, it is hard to
determine.  Run Rprof and see what summary.Rprof shows to indicate
where to focus on.

My code works but is extremely slow (because of several for loops and my programming inefficiencies); when I use the genetic algorithm to optimize the likelihood function, it takes several days to complete (on a machine with Intel Core 2 processor [2.66GHz] and 2.99 GB RAM). Computing the hessian and using it to calculate the standard errors takes a large chunk of this time.

That's exactly what I need.  Thank you.

But now, another question.  I can't seem to get the value returned by
print() into a character variable.  I tried examining the relevant print
function, to see what it's printing, but there seems not to be a
print.call().  This is not fatal, since I can use print(), but is there
some obvious way to do this?  as.character doesn't do it.

More generally, is there a way to inspect an object of some class I
don't know about to find its members and methods?  I suspect that will
save me some posts like this in the future.

Thanks,

 -tom

Use format:

f <- function(x) {
	format(match.call())
}
f(pi + 3)

Yes (though not through any fault of your own). Unile plot(), type='s'
in panel.xyplot() sorts the values before doing the steps. This
difference was not intentional (originally), but it's been around long
enough that I decided to make it a "feature" (i.e., document it) when
I discovered it.

You can still get what you want by sorting on the y-axis, and you can
do that by adding 'horizontal = TRUE'. The more general fix that I had
planned was to have panel.points() etc work as plot, so that you could
do

xyplot(..., type = "s", panel = panel.points)

It turns out that I haven't implemented that yet, but it should be in
the next update (but you need at least R 2.5.0 to use it).

Given a set of coordinates that form an irregular sampling area, is
there an R function to determine boundary points (coordinates defining
the limits of the area), either with or without user interaction ?

# for example, given the following irregular sampling area, how could
I define the boundary polygon?

(Having said that, let me point out that it is a pretty dubious  
practice to
``let the data choose the window''.  The observation window is  
*always* determined
by separate considerations, and letting the data choose the window  
distorts the
information in the observed pattern.  Remember:  There is information  
in where
the data ***aren't*** as well as in where they are; to know where  
they aren't
you have to know the a priori determined observation window.)

Following Gabor's suggestion, if x is your data.frame
you can do 

y <- x[x$month %in% c(3,4,5),]
aggregate(y[,4:6],list(y$hour),mean)

I believe we need to know the following about packages:
(1) Does the package do what it purports to do, i.e. are the results valid?
(2) Have the results generated by the package been validate against some other statistical package, or hand-worked example?
(3) Are the methods used in the soundly based?
(4) Does the package documentation refer to referred papers or textbooks?
(5) In addition to the principle result, does the package return ancillary values that allow for proper interpretation of the main result, (e.g. lm gives estimates of the betas and their SEs, but also generates residuals)?.
(6) Is the package easy to use, i.e. do the parameters used when invoking the package chosen so as to allow the package to be flexible?
(7) Are the error messages produced by the package helpful?
(8) Does the package conform to standards of R coding and good programming principles in general?
(9) Does the package interact will with the larger R environment, e.g. does it have a plot method etc.?
(10) Is the package well documented internally, i.e. is the code easy to follow, are the comments in the code adequate?
(11) Is the package well documented externally, i.e. through man pages and perhaps other documentation (e.g. MASS and its associated textbook)?

In addition to package evaluation and reviews, we also need some plan for the future of R. Who will maintain, modify, and extend packages after the principle author, or authors, retire? Software is never "done". Errors need to be corrected, programs need to be modified to accommodate changes in software and hardware. I have reasonable certainty that commercial software (e.g. SAS) will be available in 10-years (and that PROC MIXED will still be a part of SAS). I am far less sanguine about any number of R packages.

This seems a little impractical to me.  People respond so much at random
and most only tackle questions with which they feel comfortable.  As
it's not a competition in any sense, it's going to be hard to rank
people in any effective way.  But suppose you succeed in doing so, then
what?

To me a much more urgent initiative is some kind of user online review
system for packages, even something as simple as that used by Amazon.com
has for customer review of books.

I think the need for this is rather urgent, in fact.  Most packages are
very good, but I regret to say some are pretty inefficient and others
downright dangerous.  You don't want to discourage people from
submitting their work to CRAN, but at the same time you do want some
mechanism that allows users to relate their experience with it, good or
bad.

Since R is open source and help may come from varied levels of
experience on R-Help, I wonder if it might be helpful to construct a
method that can be used to "rate" those who provide help on this list.

This is something that is done on other comp lists, like
http://www.experts-exchange.com/.

I think some of the reasons for this are pretty transparent, but I
suppose one reason is that one could decide to implement the advise of
those with "superior" or "expert" levels. In other words, you can trust
the advice of someone who is more experienced more than someone who is
not. Currently, there is no way to discern who on this list is really an
R expert and who is not. Of course, there is R core, but most people
don't actually know who these people are (at least I surmise that to be
true).

If this is potentially useful, maybe one way to begin the development of
such ratings is to allow the original poster to "rate" the level of help
from those who responded. Maybe something like a very simple
questionnaire on a likert-like scale that the original poster would
respond to upon receiving help which would lead to the accumulation of
points for the responders. Higher points would result in higher levels
of expertise (e.g., novice, ..., wizaRd).

Just a random thought. What do others think?

Thanks for getting back so quick!

Thanks! I just updated to today's 2.6.1 and... it looks like adding 
horizontal=TRUE makes it work as expected (by me).

Looking forward to the planned fix,

cheers,

Subject: [R] How to cbind DF:s with differing number of rows?
In-Reply-To: <ba8c09910712010505g8facc58h8645b5d98627f192@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Lauri,

I see two possibilities.

Let say that you have
a <-c(1:5)
b <- c(1:7)
c <- c(1:4)
l <- list(a,b,c)

and you want to create an Excel file with columnA (1)
containing a (5 rows), column B (2) containing b and
column C containing c.

One possibility would be to write each ROW of the
output file separately (7 rows in your case) writing
nothing (just \t ) when you reach the end of the
particular item in the list. 

Another possibility would be to use xlsReadWritePro
package which allows to write each item (a,b,c) (or
list element - l[[1]],l[[2]],... etc) to a given
column of the output file.

Regards,

Moshe.

Hi

I am not sure but if I remember correctly I had seen similar output in 
Frank Harrel's book. So you could check some function from Hmisc package, 
probably summarize.

The issue isn't so much viewing is gsview (I've looked at previous threads
on this and all my settings in gsview are the ones recommended), but
creating a postscript file that is ready to be dumped into the LaTeX prosper
package and have a good looking graph for a presentation. Currently, the
graph comes out with lots of "white space" on a portrait oriented page.

My work around has been to open the file in Adobe and to crop the file
(interestingly, when Adobe opens the file, it does not read in the excess
"white space"). This works fine, but it is pretty inefficient.

I find it hard to believe that I can't control these things in R, but I have
been unable to so using the reference manual and this site.

Trying to do it with lattice plots is even worse...

Using curve, line, and plot, I should be able to control these things using
par(). In a lattice environment, I should be able to control these things
using par.settings().

Oh, well, I'll keep plugging away...

Subject: [R]  Help with a Loop
Message-ID: <14120625.post@talk.nabble.com>


I am having trouble getting a loop to work for the following problem. Any
help would be much appreciated. Thanks.

I need to find the slope and intercept from the linear regression of Drug
Level on Day by Participant. There are a total of 37 Participants. I need to
store the Participant, Label, Slope, and Intercept in a new data frame. 


This data is ordered by Participant number 37 total participants. A sample
of the data is given below. 


Label Participant Day DrugLevel 
17      0       1  15 1.84179  
121     0       1   5 2.10772

This is my thought process of what the loop needs to do but I cant get the
correct loop. 

X1=Day[Participant=="1"]
Y1=DrugLevel[Participant=="1"]

Coeffs=function(X1,Y1)
{
lmfirst=lm(Y1~X1)
lmfirst$coefficients
}

Coeffs(X1,Y1)

# output slope and intercept here
# do same for the next participant

X2=Day[Participant=="2"]
Y2=DrugLevel[Participant=="2"]

Coeffs=function(X2,Y2)
{
lmfirst=lm(Y2~X2)
lmfirst$coefficients
}

Coeffs(X2,Y2)

# output slope and intercept here
# do same for the next participant

X3=Day[Participant=="3"]
Y3=DrugLevel[Participant=="3"]

Coeffs=function(X3,Y3)
{
lmfirst=lm(Y3~X3)
lmfirst$coefficients
}

Coeffs(X3,Y3)

# output slope and intercept here
# do same for the next participant

# etc for the rest of the participants

# any ideas? 

# thanks

Please do tell us exactly what you are doing via a reproducible example 
(see the footer to every R-help message).

I added paper="special" to postscript() to make this easier: are you using 
it?  From the help page

      The postscript produced for a single R plot is EPS (_Encapsulated
      PostScript_) compatible, and can be included into other documents,
      e.g., into LaTeX, using '\includegraphics{<filename>}'.  For use
      in this way you will probably want to set 'horizontal = FALSE,
      onefile = FALSE, paper = "special"'.  Note that the bounding box
      is for the device region: if you find the white space around the
      plot region excessive, reduce the margins of the figure region via
      'par(mar=)'.

Further, I wrote a pdf() driver to make this easier, so why use 
postscript) to make a PDF presentation?

'Adobe' is a company, not a software package.  Which of its products did 
you mean?

Perhaps reading the help pages would solve this?  See the quote above.

Subject: [R] Attempt at package documentation on debian: link to
	"data.frame" broken
Message-ID: <fj0gn5$fcu$1@ger.gmane.org>

Hello,

I'm trying to document this little package I'm working on and have the
following issue:
one of the man files (*.Rd) contains this bit

\value{
  Returns a \code{\link[base]{data.frame}} representing the tabular data.
}

The resulting link is broken on my debian system. It points
to "file:///usr/local/lib/R/site-library/base/html/data.frame.html", while
the real file resides at "/usr/lib/R/library/base/html/data.frame.html".

Can someone please let me know how I would fix this?

Thanks, Joh

Lets try it without loop.

Does this

lapply(split(data[,4:3], data$Participant), function(x) coef(lm(x)))

give you results you want?

If yes, just put it in some object e.g. lll <- and 

do.call(rbind, lll)

gives you a table output.

look at function lmList() from package 'nlme', e.g.,

# say 'dat' is you data.frame
library(nlme)
fm <- lmList(DrugLevel ~ Day | Participant, data = dat)
fm
summary(fm)


I hope it helps.

So you are talking about the HTML conversion of your help (.Rd) file? 
(Links appear in other versions too.)

The HTML links are intended to be used via help.start(), not directly, and 
I think you find it actually points to ../../base/html/data.frame.html, 
which is correct for use from help.start.  (You are probably quoting your 
browser's intepretation of a relative URL.)

Note what the documentation says:

   There are two other forms of optional argument specified as
   \link[pkg]{foo} and \link[pkg:bar]{foo} to link to the package pkg, to
   files foo.html and bar.html respectively. These are rarely needed,
   perhaps to refer to not-yet-installed packages (but there the
   HTML help system  will resolve the link at run time) or in the normally
   undesirable event that more than one package offers help on a topic
   (in which case the present package has precedence so this is only
   needed to refer to other packages).

So unless you define data.frame() in your package, you don't need this 
form.

   I'm just a R user who joined the list searching solution for a problem.
   I do not think rating helpers is a good idea. For once, they do it freely;
   no  need  to harrash (?) anybody. On the other hand, it could have the
   opposite  effect;  people afraid to get a bad rating do not post their
   potentially valid answers.
   But more importantly, the list is full with examples of how to accomplish
   the same result with different approaches. Some might be more elegant than
   others, but for sure they show R potentialities. And I have seen several
   corrections/discussions among old timers themselves.
   Packages reviews are another issue. But if anybody is going through all that
   work, why not to make the appropriate corrections to the packages? They are
   GPL, aren't they?

   Pablo
   Mark Kimpel escribi??:

I'll throw one more idea into the mix. I agree with Bill that a rating
system for respondents is probably not that practical and of not the highest
importance. It also seems like a recipe for creating inter-personal problems
that the list doesn't need.

I do like Bill's idea of a review system for packages, which could be
incorporated into my idea that follows...

What I would find useful would be some sort of tagging system for messages.
I can't count the times I've remembered seeing a message that addresses a
question I have down the road but, when Googled, I can't find it. It would
be so nice, for example, to reliably be able to find all messages related to
a certain package or package function posted within the last X days. This
could be implemented as simply as asking posters to provide keywords at the
end of a message, but it would be great if they could somehow be pulled out
of a message and stored in a DB. For instance keywords could be surrounded
by a sequence of special characters, which a parser could then extract and
store in a DB along with the message.

Of course, this would be work to set up, but how many of our "experts" who
so kindly give of their time, get exasperated when similar questions keep
popping up on the list? Also, if we had a web-accessable DB, the responses,
not the responders, could be rated as to how well a reply takes care of an
issue. Thus, over time, a sort of auto-wiki could be born. I can think of
more uses for this as well. For example a developer could quickly check to
see what usability problems or suggestions have cropped up of on individual
package.

To me a much more urgent initiative is some kind of user online review

has for customer review of books.

I think the need for this is rather urgent, in fact.  Most packages are
very good, but I regret to say some are pretty inefficient and others
downright dangerous.  You don't want to discourage people from
submitting their work to CRAN, but at the same time you do want some
mechanism that allows users to relate their experience with it, good or

On Behalf Of Doran, Harold
Sent: Saturday, 1 December 2007 6:13 AM
To: R Help
Subject: [R] Rating R Helpers

Since R is open source and help may come from varied levels of
experience on R-Help, I wonder if it might be helpful to construct a
method that can be used to "rate" those who provide help on this list.

This is something that is done on other comp lists, like
[6]http://www.experts-exchange.com/.

I think some of the reasons for this are pretty transparent, but I
suppose one reason is that one could decide to implement the advise of
those with "superior" or "expert" levels. In other words, you can trust
the advice of someone who is more experienced more than someone who is
not. Currently, there is no way to discern who on this list is really an
R expert and who is not. Of course, there is R core, but most people
don't actually know who these people are (at least I surmise that to be
true).

If this is potentially useful, maybe one way to begin the development of
such ratings is to allow the original poster to "rate" the level of help
from those who responded. Maybe something like a very simple
questionnaire on a likert-like scale that the original poster would
respond to upon receiving help which would lead to the accumulation of
points for the responders. Higher points would result in higher levels
of expertise (e.g., novice, ..., wizaRd).

Just a random thought. What do others think?

Harold

???? This chunk is pure R code and shouldn't output anything directly in
the output file. Since you are telling "echo=T', whatever is output by
your code is sent to your output file, and since you assert
"results=xml",this output is interpreted as xml ; since this isn't XML,
your're getting guff from the XML interpreter.

I'd rather do :
<<makeGraph, echo=FALSE>>=
invisible({
# Whatever you did ...
})
@
instead. Your second chunk :

> <<insertGraph, echo=T, results=xml>>=
> odfInsertPlot(file=fileplot, height=5, width=5 )
> @

should insert your plot in the output file.

[Snip ... ]

BTW : Windows (enhanced) metafile are Windows-specific. As far as I can
tell, recent versions of Office and OpenOffice.org correctly render
Encapsulated Postcript files, thus freeing you from another Windows
demendency. Unless you *have* to have an EMF output (it happens, I know
...), youd'better use use this format directly.

Dear useRs,

I'm trying to specify the colour of a factor with ggplot2. The example
below gets me close to what I want, but it's missing a legend.

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Thierry

library(ggplot2)
dataset <- data.frame(x = rnorm(40), y = runif(40), z = gl(4, 10, labels
= LETTERS[1:4]))
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x = x, y = y, group = z)) + geom_point(colour
= c("red", "green", "blue", "black"))

Yes. I'm actually using (the really nice) rkward, which calls the html-help
pages upon "?<something>". May this be specific to that usage ... now that
I'm looking deeper into this I find that rkward actually tells me:
Using non-linked HTML file: style sheet and hyperlinks may be incorrect

I see. This was actually part of the desperate attempt to find a solution to
this wrong link target issue. I'm using a plain "\link(data.frame)" now
again.

No, it was R that warned you.  (It seem you have swapped the credit and

It all works via help.start() (as I did say), at least in a reliable R 
front end.  Running help.start() is how you set this up.

I think Gabor has answered your question directly, but another approach 
to solve the same underlying problem might be to work with Sweave.   (Or 
ODFweave, etc.)

These allow you to mix R code right into a document that explains the 
reasoning and includes both the input and output of the script.

You are right - naturally. After calling 'help.start()' everything works
just fine. Is there any way one can call 'help.start()' transparently to
the user when s/he accesses the html-help?

Thanks for your patience, Joh

Subject: [R] Help with tables
In-Reply-To: <OFA8D61202.7C9DFE4F-ONC12573A6.002E7813-C12573A6.002EB42D@precheza.cz>
Message-ID: <001901c835ab$d8dc5fe0$327412ac@FARMER0001>

Hello everyone.  I want to thank you for your response.

I tried this on weekend to attack my problem:


1)  Turned into factors all my variables to tabulate:

	infec1<-bamas$P2_A
	infec2<-bamas$P2_B
	infec3<-bamas$P2_C
	aglomera<-bamas$QCL_1

	Where bamas is my data frame, P2_A, P2_B and P2_C the infections and QCL_1
the clusters.

2)  Defined a table for each one of the variables I wanted:

	t1<-table(infec1,aglomera)
	t2<-table(infec2,aglomera)
	t3<-table(infec3,aglomera)

3)  Tables generated above are of n1 x 4, n2 x 4, n3 x 4 where n1, n2 and n3
are different and so the dimmensions of my matrices, then if I want to sum
the three tables R showed me the error that they were of
     different dimmensions, so I decided to make them of the same
dimmensions by "filling the holes" (missing rows) with zeros of each row in
each  table in order to transform them into a matrix of N x 4:

     For example, comparing my table t1 with t2, I could see that, in table
1 there where missing rows 7, 10, 12 and 13, and in the case of t3 rows 7
and 12 ;

t1

	aglomera
infec1   1   2   3   4
    1  117  88  76  83
    2   10  10   9   7
    3   15  11  14  14
    4    2   0   1   1
    5    2   3   1   0
    6    1   0   1   0
    8    3   3   0   1
    9    3   1   1   0
    11   0   0   1   1

t3

      aglomera
infec2  1  2  3  4
    1  12  9  6  6
    2  37 45 33 37
    3  11 11  8 11
    4   3  0  0  2
    5   2  1  0  0
    6   0  0  0  1
    8   3  1  2  2
    9   2  2  0  2
    10  1  1  2  1
    11  1  0  0  0
    13  0  0  1  0

Then I did the following instructions

	u<-cbind(0,0,0,0)
	rt1<-rbind(t1[1:6,],u,t1[7:8,],u,t1[9,],u,u)

	rt2<-rbind(t2[1:6,],u,t2[7:10,],u,u,t2[11,])

	rt3<-rbind(t3[1:6,],u,t3[7:10,],u,u)

4) Now all my tables are 13 x 4 so I defined as matrix:

	mrt1<-matrix(rt1,nrow=13,ncol=4)
	mrt2<-matrix(rt2,nrow=13,ncol=4)
	mrt3<-matrix(rt2,nrow=13,ncol=4)

5) And then I added them:

	total<-mrt1+mrt2+mrt3
	total

      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
 [1,]  130   97   83   89
 [2,]   53   55   42   46
 [3,]   33   36   36   39
 [4,]    5    1    2    3
 [5,]    5    4    1    0
 [6,]    1    1    1    3
 [7,]    0    0    0    0
 [8,]    8    6    4    4
 [9,]    6    4    1    2
[10,]    1    2    2    3
[11,]    1    1    1    1
[12,]    0    0    0    0
[13,]    0    0    1    0

which is the result I wanted.

I don't know if this is the best way to make this kind of tables, but at
least it worked well on weekend late at night :P

If someone have a better (faster) way to make them please help me.

Warm regards from Mexico.

Hi

I am not sure but if I remember correctly I had seen similar output in
Frank Harrel's book. So you could check some function from Hmisc package,
probably summarize.

It is potentially very slow (ca 40 secs on our dept system with 1500 
NFS-mounted packages) in R 2.6.1.  But you could put utils::help.start() 
in ~/.Rprofile.

In R-devel you will be able to have

 	utils:::make.packages.html()

in ~/.Rprofile and that takes a few seconds at most.

Hmmm, I see. This is all local. So there does not seem to be a way to make any 
old R installation that loads the package initialize this functionality, so 
that the help files will be correctly interlinked directly after "require" 
or "library"? How do other packages manage that?

They don't: it is up to the users.  Many users never use HTML help, and 
many do not install in /usr/lib/R/site-library.

Dear Domenico,

It looks like my question wasn't very clear. I want to specify the
colours meself. Colour = z will use default colours and I'd like to
change those. I need to change them into red, green, blue and black
instead of pink, brown, green and blue.

The solution should have the layout of:

ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x = x, y = y, colour = z)) + geom_point()

But the colours of:

ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x = x, y = y, group = z)) + geom_point(colour
= c("red", "green", "blue", "black"))


Cheers,

Thierry

Don't know, but I would try out the alternatives fisherfit [vegan package]
and fisher [untb package] and see if either behaves better (it was faster
for me to look these up than to dig through the code and see what's
going on for these examples).

   You could also try contacting Prof. Harms [sic] and asking him ...

Subject: [R]  Linear Regression, Data is a list
Message-ID: <14130322.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello,

I would like to perform a linear regression and the data is a list.e.g
lm(list$abc~., data=list) or lm(abc~., data=list), which would give the same
result.

The problem is I would like to call the response variable in a more general
form. What I try to achieve is sth like lm(list$(paste("a","b","c"))~.,
data=list), but it does not work. 

Could anyone give me some advice?Many thanks.

Subject: [R] Why is the program too slow?

try

RSiteSearch("Fisher's alpha")

which indicates that there is the fishers.alpha() function in package 
'untb' that does the same thing, e.g.,

fishers.alpha(1000, 70)

fishers.alpha(1580, 30)
fishers.alpha(1000, 7)


I hope it helps.

Hi Thierry,

Have a look at http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/scale_identity.  (The way you
are currently doing it only works because you are not using any kind
of grouping/facetting, and I'm thinking about adding an explicit
message/warning for this case)

I am not an experienced user of qcc, (nor am I an expert), but I doubt 
that very many of the other readers of r-help are users of qcc either. 
Looking at the code of qcc and then at help for the package, the number 
of violating runs is determined through the shewhart.rules() function and 
the gcc.options$("run.length") argument. It looks as though you could 
send arguments to the rules= parameter when calling qcc() that would 
override the default. Looking further at the package documantation and 
the qcc.options() function my suggestion (which I tested and seems to 
have the effect I believe you requested) would be to try something like:

qcc.options("run.length"=5) #before the qcc(...) invocation

....and if you wanted to "turn it off", then set "run.length" to 
something impossibly high.

qcc.options("run.length"=1000) # number of violating runs becomes zero

If that does not work, then another method for getting help with a 
package is to send an email to the package maintainer.

Subject: [R] cor(data.frame) infelicities
Message-ID: <4754123B.5030902@yorku.ca>

In using cor(data.frame), it is annoying that you have to explicitly 
filter out non-numeric columns, and when you don't, the error message
is misleading:

 > cor(iris)
Error in cor(iris) : missing observations in cov/cor
In addition: Warning message:
In cor(iris) : NAs introduced by coercion

It would be nicer if stats:::cor() did the equivalent *itself* of the 
following for a data.frame:
 > cor(iris[,sapply(iris, is.numeric)])
              Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width
Sepal.Length    1.0000000  -0.1175698    0.8717538   0.8179411
Sepal.Width    -0.1175698   1.0000000   -0.4284401  -0.3661259
Petal.Length    0.8717538  -0.4284401    1.0000000   0.9628654
Petal.Width     0.8179411  -0.3661259    0.9628654   1.0000000
 >

A change could be implemented here:
     if (is.data.frame(x))
         x <- as.matrix(x)

Second, the default, use="all" throws an error if there are any
NAs.  It would be nicer if the default was use="complete.cases",
which would generate warnings instead.  Most other statistical
software is more tolerant of missing data.

 > library(corrgram)
 > data(auto)
 > cor(auto[,sapply(auto, is.numeric)])
Error in cor(auto[, sapply(auto, is.numeric)]) :
   missing observations in cov/cor
 > cor(auto[,sapply(auto, is.numeric)],use="complete")
# works; output elided

You can calculate the Kendall rank correlation with such a matrix
so you would not want to exclude factors in that case:

Subject: [R] linking C/C++ external libraries.
Message-ID: <7132FEC5-FA92-406F-A8F0-1A020577CE97@ed.ac.uk>

Hi Everyone,

I'm trying to load some C++ code using dyn.load but I'm getting  
unresolved symbols associated with some external libraries  
(CSparse).  I gather this is something to do with linking as the the  
code compiles fine.  However, I've passed

-L/home/jarrod/My_Programs/SuiteSparse/CSparse/Lib -lcsparse

to the complier (g++), either directly using R CMD SHLIB or as  
PKG_LIBS in a Makevars file, and I cannot resolve the problem.  I'm  
working with R 2.6.0 on fedora 6

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Jarrod

Thanks Hadley.

The page you referred to was actually
http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/scale_identity.html

The solution to my problem was

library(ggplot2)
dataset <- data.frame(x = rnorm(40), y = runif(40), z = gl(4, 10, labels
= LETTERS[1:4]))
dataset$MyColour <- factor(dataset$z, labels = c("red", "green", "blue",
"black"))
ggplot(data = dataset, aes(x = x, y = y, colour = MyColour)) +
geom_point() + scale_colour_identity(labels=levels(dataset$z),
grob="tile", name="z")

If i understand your question, you can try this:

 lapply(paste("lis$", names(lis), " ~ . ", sep=""), lm, data=lis)

You need to use na.action=na.exclude, _and_ to use the proper extractor 
function residuals() rather than pick up a component of the fitted object 
by partial matching.

See ?residuals.lm and ?naresid

Another option would be to use ggplot2:

install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

qplot(rownames(RankVar), MeanDecreaseAccuracy, data = RankVar, colour
= Standard.Deviance)

and then use http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/scale_colour_gradient.html to
control the choice of colours for the mapping.

Hallo,

I am trying to import a website and structure it from within R:

The following code:

data <-
scan(file='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Recentchanges',what='character')

results in the error:

Error in file(file, "r") : unable to open connection
In addition: Warning message:
cannot open: HTTP status was '403 Forbidden' in: file(file, "r")

It seems that the error is connected to the UTF-8-format of wikipedia,
since the following line works:

data <- scan(file='http://www.google.de',what='character')

I am looking forward to your answers.

Greetings

Can you show us your error message upon load?  What does ldd say when pointed
at your package's library?  How exactly is the linking done?

Compare all that to a working library such as eg Matrix. That may provide
further clues.

more elegantly, I would like to have the 12 tics with the month shortened

Hi Jim,

Thanks for your suggestion. My guess is that most of the time is taken
by various kinds of assignments that I am making using loops; and these
can be done without loops. In a follow-up post, I will try to explain in
greater detail each part of my code (especially the parts where
assignments are being made) with comments.

Meanwhile I am copying the output from Rprof below. Any suggestions on
how to increase efficiency on the basis of this output?

My code works but is extremely slow (because of several for loops and my programming inefficiencies); when I use the genetic algorithm to optimize the likelihood function, it takes several days to complete (on a machine with Intel Core 2 processor [2.66GHz] and 2.99 GB RAM). Computing the hessian and using it to calculate the standard errors takes a large chunk of this time.

Another option would be to use ggplot2:

install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

qplot(rownames(RankVar), MeanDecreaseAccuracy, data = RankVar, colour
= Standard.Deviance)

and then use http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/scale_colour_gradient.html to
control the choice of colours for the mapping.

Subject: [R] Installing packages
Message-ID: <475446A5.3010601@uab.cat>

Hello,
I have a problem when making packages with version 2.6.1. I have a 
package which I could install in version 2.5.1. I have made some 
modifications of the package, and I would like to install it to 2.6.1. I 
check the package with R CMD check, I build it with R CMD build and when 
I try to install it it gives me an error, it tries to install something 
like R.css and tells me that cannot open the DESCRIPTION file. Then, I 
made the same procedure with version 2.5.1 and it worked fine. I am 
using Windows Vista and I changed the PATH environment variable to 
version 2.6.1. Any suggestion to solve the problem?
Best regards,

Dani

Software is never "done". Errors need to be corrected, programs need to be modified to accommodate changes in software and hardware. I have reasonable certainty that commercial software (e.g. SAS) will be available in 10-years (and that PROC MIXED will still be a part of SAS). I am far less sanguine about any number of R packages.

Interesting questions.

Re, the future : LaTeX provides an example. The more complex
packages tend to stop developing when the original programmer
loses interest. Sometimes another person picks one up, but not
frequently. I think, for example, of the many slide-preparation
packages, each more complex than the next, that have come and
gone during my relatively short (15 yr) professional use of
LaTeX.

At its root, this is a rather deep question: how open-source,
largely volunteer-developed software can survive over the long
term, while continuing to improve and maintain high standards.
We are rather early in the history of free software development
to know the answer.

    ,

Thank you for trying. Strange.

I am using R version 2.6.0 Patched (2007-11-09 r43408) on OSX and it is
not working. I guess it has something to do with the language settings.

However.

Yes, good point!  And of a course of a scatterplot of mean vs variance
will best reveal the relationship between the two variables.

You might look at 'jitter' to add a little offset to the labels being plotted.

I don't think there are any functions to automatically avoid overlaps, 
but it is not hard to manually move some of the labels.  For example, 
you could alternate labels above and below with code like this:

 > x <- 1:10
 > y <- rep(0, 10)
 > plot(x,y)
 > text(x, y, rep("label", 10), pos=rep(c(1,3), 5))

because the pos parameter can be specified separately for each observation.

Message-ID: <1196706597.10417.9.camel@localhost>

Jim and others,

As far as I can see the computation of certain conditional probabilities
(required for computing my likelihood function) is what is slowing down
the evaluation of the likelihood function. Let me explain what these
conditional probabilities are and how I am (no doubt inefficiently)
calculating them. I apologize for the long post but I could not explain
the whole thing without some detailed examples, etc. 

For every family, we are given a completed birth sequence (call it S_i)
and the desired maximum number of children (call it N_i); for instance
S_i might be GBB (where G stands for a girl and B stands for a boy) and
N_i might be 4. For each family, we want to compute the the probability
of observing the birth sequence, S_i, given that the family is
"targeting" sons. Since, a priori, we do not know the desired target
(for sons) for family i, we need to allow for all the feasible
possibilities. So, when a family states that the maximum number of
children that it desires is N_i, we need to allow for the possibilities
that the family targets 1 son, 2 sons, ... , (N_i-1) sons. Of course the
actual birth sequence might assign zero probability to some of these
possibilities; but we cannot rule out any of these a priori. 

Let us denote a target for sons as k_i. So, for family i with birth
sequence S_i and desired maximum number of children N_i, we need to
compute the following (N_i-1) conditional probabilities: P(S_i|N_i,
k_i=1, T_i=1), P(S_i|N_i, k_i=2, T_i=1), ... , P(S_i|N_i, k_i=N_i-1,
T_i=1). 

Let q be the probability of male birth; it is a parameter in my model
and will be estimated. Now, to compute something like P(S_i|N_i, k_i,
T_i=1), we merely need to observe whether the family has any child after
the k_i^{th} son. If there is a child after the k_i^{th} son, then we
assign zero probability to P(S_i|N_i, k_i, T_i=1); else we assign it a
probability of (q^(nb[j]))*((1-q)^(ng[j])), where q is the probability
of a male birth, nb is the number of boys in the sequence S_i and ng is
the number of girls in the sequence.

An example might clarify matters. Suppose a family reports that the
maximum number of children it desires to have is 4 and the birth
sequence (starting with the first born child) for the family is observed
to be GGBG (where G stands for a girl and B stands for a boy). For such
a family, we need to compute the following probabilities: $(GGBG|N_i=4,
k_i=1, T_i=1), P(GGBG|N_i=4, k_i=2, T_i=1), and P(GGBG|N_i=4, k_i=3,
T_i=1). Since there is a child after the first boy, this family could
not possibly be targeting one son; hence P(GGBG|N_i=4, k_i=1, T_i=1)=0.
But the family could conceivably be targeting two or even three sons;
these possibilities are not ruled out by the observed birth sequence.
Hence P(GGBG|N_i=4, k_i=2, T_i=1)=(q)*((1-q)^3), and similarly P(GGBG|
N_i=4, k_i=3, T_i=1)=(q)*((1-q)^3). 

To clarify matters further, take another example. Suppose the family in
question reports a maximum desired family size (number of children) of 4
and we observe the following completed birth sequence for the same
family: BGB. Since there is a child after the first boy, this family
could not possibly be targeting one son; hence P(BGB|N_i=4, k_i=1,
T_i=1)=0. Since there is no child after the second boy, the family could
possibly be targeting 2 sons; hence P(BGB|N_i=4, k_i=2,
T_i=1)=(q^2)*((1-q)). And since the family stops at three children (with
two sons), it cannot be targeting three sons; to target three sons, the
family should have gone for another child and not stopped at the third
child (and second son). Hence, P(BGB|N_i=4, k_i=3, T_i=1)=0.

In my sample I let N_i run from 2 to 6. So, depending on whether N_i is
2 , 3, 4, 5 or 6, I need to compute these conditional probabilities. For
instance, if N_i is 2, I need to compute only one conditional
probability; if N_i is 6, I need to compute five of these conditional
probabilities. This is how I proceed.

I start by creating a 6x6 matrix of zeros and a 1x15 vector of zeros.

   S <- matrix(0, 6, 6)  # CREATE A 6x6 MATRIX OF ZEROS
   y <- numeric(15)      # CREATE A 1x15 VECTOR OF ZEROS 

Then the following part of the code computes the conditional
probabilities as rows of the matrix S. The code picks up the jth row if
the family has N_i=j. Once this is done, I store the lower triangle of
the matrix (i.e., entries below the principal diagonal) in the y vector.

--------------- begin code fragment -------------------------

    q <- 1/(1+exp(delta))   # PROBABILITY OF MALE BIRTH

 ###### N1 IS "DESIRED FAMILY SIZE" ######################
 ##### alive IS THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN ALIVE IN THE FAMILY
 ##### nb IS NUMBER OF BOYS IN THE FAMILY
 ##### ng IS THE NUMBER OF GIRLS IN THE FAMILY

    if (alive[j]==N1) {

        for (i in 1:(N1-1)) {
                S[N1,i] <- (q^(nb[j]))*((1-q)^(ng[j]))

    }

    else {
        for (i in 1:(N1-1)) {

c(S[2,1],S[3,1],S[3,2],S[4,1],S[4,2],S[4,3],S[5,1],S[5,2],S[5,3],S[5,4],S[6,1],S[6,2],S[6,3],S[6,4],S[6,5])

------------------ end code fragment ------------------------------

Later, I use the entries in the y vector for computing the likelihood.
Any suggestions on how to rework this part of the code will, I think,
improve overall efficiency.

Thanks in advance for your time.

My code works but is extremely slow (because of several for loops and my programming inefficiencies); when I use the genetic algorithm to optimize the likelihood function, it takes several days to complete (on a machine with Intel Core 2 processor [2.66GHz] and 2.99 GB RAM). Computing the hessian and using it to calculate the standard errors takes a large chunk of this time.

In the code below the first source command works fine, but the second
does not, as can be seen from the error message. Is there a way to
have the second command work?

I am using R 2.6.1 on Windows Vista.

(The command that is in the clipboard is just "x <- 3")

Error in file(srcfile$filename, open = "rt", encoding = srcfile$encoding) :

Thanks for the help.

Subject: [R]  Putting a NULL in a list (as cannot pass NA to C++)
Message-ID: <C07600F3B08324418B460FD82E3ADC340C605DAA@exukmb12.eur.nsroot.net>

Hi,

If I do the following I can have a NULL in a list 

> x <- list( 1, list(3,NULL,4), 5 )
> x
[[1]]
[1] 1

[[2]]
[[2]][[1]]
[1] 3

[[2]][[2]]
NULL

[[2]][[3]]
[1] 4


[[3]]
[1] 5

This is a good thing for me as it can be passed through into C++ where I
can know the value is missing. (Can't seem to detect a NA from C++ for
some reason. There is RF_isNull in the API but no RF_isNA that I can
find!)

Is it possible to put a null in an already created list. e.g. now do

> x[[2]][[2]] <- NULL
> x
[[1]]
[1] 1

[[2]]
[[2]][[1]]
[1] 3

[[2]][[2]]
[1] 4


[[3]]
[1] 5


But x[[2]][[2]] has been deleted.

Many thanks

Regards,
David

That looks like a little bug.  I'll fix it in a day or two, but in the 
meantime you can work around it with code like this (which you'd 
probably want to put in a function, not type all the time yourself):

f <- file("clipboard", open="r")
source(f, echo=T)
close(f)

I'd call that another infelicity.  Species is supposed to be nominal,
not ordinal, so rank correlation wouldn't make much sense.  So what does
cor(, method="kendall") do?  It looks like it simply uses the underlying
numeric code.  (Change Species to numerics and you'll see the same
answer.)  However, reordering the levels changes the result:

R> iris2 <- iris
R> levels(iris2$Species) <- levels(iris2$Species)[c(2, 1, 3)]
R> cor(iris2, method = "kendall")
             Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width   Species
Sepal.Length   1.00000000 -0.07699679    0.7185159   0.6553086 0.1897778
Sepal.Width   -0.07699679  1.00000000   -0.1859944  -0.1571257 0.1439793
Petal.Length   0.71851593 -0.18599442    1.0000000   0.8068907 0.2677154
Petal.Width    0.65530856 -0.15712566    0.8068907   1.0000000 0.2724843
Species        0.18977778  0.14397927    0.2677154   0.2724843 1.0000000

To me, this is dangerous!

You are right but I was just trying to stick to the same example.
In reality it would be ok as long as its an ordered factor.  One could
restrict it to those of class "ordered".

This looks like the MatLab palette that's in tim.colors:

library(fields)  # tim.colors:  Matlab-like color palette

N <- 100
par(lend="square")
plot(rep(1,N), type="h", col=tim.colors(N), lwd=6, ylim=c(0,1))

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] new package 'bvls', update of 'nnls'
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.56.0712032032140.15974@laurel.few.vu.nl>

A new package 'bvls' is available on CRAN.

The package provides an R interface to the Stark-Parker algorithm for
bounded-variable least squares (BVLS) that solves A x = b with the
constraint l <= x <= u under least squares criteria, where l,x,u \in R^n,
b \in R^m and A is an m \times n matrix.

The Stark-Parker BVLS algorithm was published in

 Stark PB, Parker RL (1995). Bounded-variable least-squares: an
 algorithm and applications, Computational Statistics, 10, 129-141.

The packages interfaces the Fortran77 code distributed via the statlib
on-line software repository at Carnegie Mellon University
(http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/bvls), modified very slightly for
compatibility with the gfortran compiler.  Stark and Parker have agreed to
distribution under GPL version 2 or newer.

The function 'bvls::bvls' returns an object of (S3) class 'bvls', which
has methods for 'coefficients', 'fitted.values', 'deviance' and
'residuals'.

====

Version 1.1 of the package 'nnls' is available on CRAN.
Changes between Version 1.0 and 1.1:

	o The function 'nnls::nnls' returns an object of (S3) class
	  'nnls', which has methods for 'coefficients',
	  'fitted.values', 'deviance' and 'residuals'

	o The function 'nnnpls::nnnpls' allows each element of x to be
	  constrained to either a non-positive or a non-negative value

The OP might like to take a look at the orditorp function in package 
vegan, which is designed to add information from complex ecological 
data sets with many species to ordinations. It works out if a label 
can be placed and if not draws a point. The OP would have to modify it 
to try another place to plot, but that might be a basis from which to 
work.

Of course, if this is a one-off project Duncan's solution is more than 
adequate.

Thanks for your help, but there is some more problem. The two vectors have
not the same length so there is a problem with cbind. I give you an example.
My first vector is

 >g[g[,1]>2035 & g[,1]<2050,]
    
     M.Z     Intensity
 2035.836  652.9494
 2035.939  664.5841
 2036.043  696.0554
 2036.146  719.8969
 2036.250  750.7660
 2036.767  816.5243
 2036.870  806.8539
 2036.974  774.2397
 2037.491  777.2780
 2039.147  589.9075
 2042.978  807.7167
 2043.082  820.9365
 2043.289  849.4942
 2043.393  883.8975
 2043.495  900.9681
 2043.600  922.3238
 2043.704  956.5985
 2043.911  978.9377
 2044.015  969.1999

and the second one is:

The two vectors have not the same number of observations and in fact i would
like to replace all the intensity of zero of the second vector by the value
of the intensity of the nearest m/Z of the first vector.
In this case, the value 816.5243 for the m/Z 2036.663 of the second vector
and 900.9681 for the intensity corresponding at m/Z=2043.497.

Your method give me the intensity of the farest m/Z.

Thanks you again.

What I am using is LaTeX with the prosper package to create a presentation
which I give using Adobe Reader (or Acrobat if it is available).

My issue is that it just seems like too many steps to get a "publication
ready" figure. I'll try what you suggested above, thanks.

Sorry, Acrobat, thought that went without saying, my bad.

Lattice panel functions need to use grid graphics primitives.
Traditional graphics functions, like your panelwhite.corplot, do not
qualify, and will not (easily) work with lattice.

You might find the ?panel.points manual page helpful.

Hi All.

I would like to compute a separate covariance matrix for a set of
variables for each of the levels of a factor and then compute the
average covariance matrix over the factor levels.  I can loop through
this computation but I need to perform the calculation for a large
number of levels and am looking for something more elegant.  To be
concrete....

u    <- 3
n    <- 10

x    <- rnorm((id*u))
y    <- rnorm((id*u))
z    <- rnorm((id*u))
id   <- gl(u,n)

df   <- data.frame(id,x,y,z)
df.s <- split(xxx,id)

lcov <- lapply(df.s,cov)
lcov

What's an efficient way to compute the average covariance matrix over
the list members in "lcov"?

Thanks in advance,

Rick DeShon

Is this what you were looking for?


Writing R Extensions

6.4 Missing and IEEE special values

A set of functions is provided to test for NA, Inf, -Inf and NaN. These 
functions are accessed via macros:

      ISNA(x)        True for R's NA only
      ISNAN(x)       True for R's NA and IEEE NaN
      R_FINITE(x)    False for Inf, -Inf, NA, NaN

HTH,

Chuck

p.s. grep '<something>' within R's include directory can quickly resolve 
questions like this.

something like this:

day<-c('Day -1','Day 6','Day 10')


   This vector specifies the order in which several
panel will appear in a lattice plots. But the order in
which such plots will appear will be the following:
Day -1, Day 10, Day 6. Which makes sense, but I cannot
name the Days like this: Day -01,Day 10, Day 06, which
would put the levels in the order I want them to be.

  Now, this vector won't always have the same values,
it could be:

day<-c('Day -1, 'Day 2','Day 14')

   So I cannot set the levels manually:

levels(day)<-c('Day -1', 'Day something','Day
something else')
 I tried as.ordered, but I guess I am not using the
right function. 

How can I command the script to put the panels in the
original  order given of the vector in a data frame?

Thank  you,

Judith

Returning to my original post, I still believe that a basic work-horse
like cor(data.frame) with the default method="pearson" should try to do 
something more useful in this case than barf with a misleading error
message if the data frame contains character variables.

To paraphrase Einstein,
``Things [in R] should be made as simple as possible, but not any simpler''

The case that Andy Liaw cited is a good example of the 'not any
simpler' part.

Maybe your email software corrupted it somehow.  Often
email software will cause weird line wrappings, for example.
Or maybe you have an old version of R or zoo.  I am running zoo
1.4.0 and "R version 2.6.0 Patched (2007-10-08 r43124)"

I just located my post in the archives
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2007-December/147481.html

and copied it from there pasting it into a fresh R session and
it worked.

Well, you need some sort of rule that can be used to determine the
order of the levels. The default (see ?factor) is 'levels =
sort(unique(x))'. If you instead want, say, levels in the order of
first appearance (assuming that's what you mean by "original order"),
you could define

my.factor = function(x) { factor(x, levels = unique(x)) }

and then use

> day<- my.factor(c('Day -1','Day 6','Day 10'))
> day
[1] Day -1 Day 6  Day 10
Levels: Day -1 Day 6 Day 10

You could strip the 'Day' part of the elements using gsub(), sort the
numeric part and then paste() 'Day' back to the result:

set.seed(1)
day <- paste("Day", sample(-2:10))

> day
 [1] "Day 1"  "Day 2"  "Day 4"  "Day 7"  "Day -1" "Day 5"  "Day 8" 
 [8] "Day 10" "Day 3"  "Day -2" "Day 9"  "Day 0"  "Day 6" 

day.tmp <- sort(as.numeric(gsub("[^0-9\\-]", "", day)))

> day.tmp
 [1] -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

day.levels <- paste("Day", day.tmp)

> day.levels
 [1] "Day -2" "Day -1" "Day 0"  "Day 1"  "Day 2"  "Day 3"  "Day 4" 
 [8] "Day 5"  "Day 6"  "Day 7"  "Day 8"  "Day 9"  "Day 10"

day.ord <- factor(day, levels = day.levels)

# Note the order of the levels versus the order of the factor output
> day.ord
 [1] Day 1  Day 2  Day 4  Day 7  Day -1 Day 5  Day 8  Day 10 Day 3 
[10] Day -2 Day 9  Day 0  Day 6 
13 Levels: Day -2 Day -1 Day 0 Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Day 5 ... Day 10

All the analysis that i have seen regarding ARIMA modeling, had the residuals acf,  within the confidence interval, while my residual acf at first lag is very close to one (and going out of the confidence interval), even if the Box.test can not reject the null hypothesis of a significant acf for all my residuals.

Perhaps you misread the plot? I've tried your code and the there is no 
significant correlation at lag 1, but at lag zero, which is 1 by definition.

Are you referring to the 95% prediction limits (as in Box 1994 "Time 
series analysis: forecasting and control" pp 139?145)? If so, a bad 
model would mean that the variance of the shocks (errors) is higher, 
therefore the prediction limits would be wider. (In other words, you've 
explained less of the variance of the time series.)

I've found that for a given time series you can fit several different 
ARIMA models with very similar results. Out of a group of "sensible" 
models (judged by residuals and cross-validated forecast MSE), I'd 
choose the simplest model(s).

  oops -- I think you should get the distance matrix via some form of

distfun <- function(x1,x2) { (x1-x2)^2 }

outer(m1[,1],y,distfun)

  my first answer was simply wrong.
  (I don't have time to test this -- play around to make sure
I put the vectors in the right order.)

  cheers

I played around with this a bit more and noticed that the "plinear"
algorithm of nls converged using nearly every starting value I tried.  In fact
A = 0 was the only starting value that I could find that did not converge.
Note that with "plinear" you only specify the starting values for non-linear
parameters, in this case A, while the unnamed linear parameters are implied
as coefficients of the columns of the matrix defined in the rhs.

Subject: [R]  strsplit on comma, with a trailing comma in input
Message-ID: <14141151.post@talk.nabble.com>


I have a comma-separated data file in which trailing commas sometimes occur. 
I am using strsplit to extract the data from this file, and it seems great
except in cases with trailing comma characters.

The example below illustrates.  What I'd like is to get a fourth element in
the answer, being an empty string just like the second element.  Is there a
way I can express my patter (or perhaps specify perl or extended) to get
that?


> strsplit("a,,b,", ",")[[1]]
[1] "a" ""  "b"

my understanding is that this behavior is known (the help file  
mentions something along these lines in the example).

i'd use something like:

theText <- "a,,b,"
theText <- gsub("\\,$", ", ", theText)

and then use strsplit() on "theText"

b

Try appending another comma:

strsplit(paste("a,,b,", ",", sep = ""), ",")

Hmm, I don't think strsplit can do that. However:

Message-ID: <14142187.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hi, I deal with 3D array say:

     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1    4    7   10   13

[2,]   17   20   23   26   29

I want to calculate means in the cells with respect to dimention 3rd so for
example (1+16+31)/3 or (15+30+45)/3  AND avoid taking zeros into account.

I did it with a loop but I guess there is the other more straightforward
method. will be very grateful for help...

Subject: [R] Efficient computation of average covariance matrix over a

I believe that computing covariance matrices takes
much more time than computing their average and so it
does not matter how you do this, but one possibility
is:

z<- lcov[[1]]*0
y <- sapply(lcov,function(x) {z<<-z+x;0;})
y <- y/length(lcov)

say your array is called "no.named.array".

then:

no.named.array[no.named.array == 0] <- NA
rowMeans(no.named.array, dims=2, na.rm=T)

Why does this go in Junk mail if @r-project.org is defined as not junk?

Why are you asking us about how you have your mail filters set up?

If you didn't set them up yourself, you should find out from your local 
admin who did, and ask them.

Instead of colorRampPalette(), you could also use diverge_hcl() in package
"vcd" to get a perceptually-based version, e.g.,

  levelplot(x, col.regions = diverg_hcl(16))

Subject: [R] Problem with a global variable
Message-ID: <000301c83639$b619f790$2f01a8c0@dell2400>

From: Thomas Jones

I have several user-defined functions. As is standard practice, I am 
defining a logical vector named idebug in order to control debugging 
printouts. For example, if idebug [1] has the value TRUE, such-and-such 
debugging printouts are enabled. After the function works, some or all of 
the debugging printouts can be inhibited. idebug is a global variable; 
otherwise, it would have to be moved around with function arguments in a way 
which is clunky and hard to get right. However, I am getting an error 
message. This message was emitted during the loading of the program and is 
NOT inside any function.

Or perhaps idebug wants a special slot on the search path.

Your advice?

You may wish to use the options command.  You can create

Hi R,

 

I want to do some rolling correlations. But before, I searched for
"?rollingCorrelation" and tried the example in it. But I was not
successful. What could be the problem? Here is the code I tried:

 

> library(zoo)

> library(PerformanceAnalytics)

> rollingCorrelation(manager.ts at Data[,1],edhec.ts at Data,n=12)

Error in inherits(object, "zoo") : object "manager.ts" not found

If you want to use just zoo alone then its done like this.  See
?rollapply and the two zoo vignettes.

Don't know about "dangerous", but I would like the opportunity to
provide feedback or to have seen feedback from others when I
contemplating using a package I see on CRAN.  This is particularly
true for package maintainers who seem to have vanished.

Such a "rating" would have a natural place.  I don't see where ratings
for helpers would exist in cyberspace for enquirers to the list.  A
compulsory part of everyone's email signatures?  Don't like that idea.

Hmm,  I would have recommended

  colorRampPalette(c('dark red','white','dark blue'), 
                   space = "Lab")

where the 'space = "Lab"' part also makes sure that a
"perceptually-based" space rather than RGB is used.

I think the functions colorRamp() and (even more)
colorRampPalette()  are very nice, part of "standard R" and 
still not known and used enough.
Note that they are based on 'convertColor()' and other color
space functionality in R all of which deserve more usage 
in my oppinion and also in my own code ! ;-) 

Package 'vcd' (and others) use package 'colorspace', 
and I have wondered in the past if these color space computations
should not be merged into to standard R (package 'grDevices').
But that's really a topic for another thread, on R-devel, not R-help..

Dear Ben,
I was searching for the same problem. Thank you very much, it helped me a lot and I will use it quite often!

In addition to the problem given by tintin_et_milou. I have to compare a two pairs of vectors.

I.e. I have two datasets each with latitude and longitude (which defines the geographical position of data points.)
As you might imagine, it is meaningful to take into account both latitude and longitude, when searching for the nearest data point from the otehr dataset.

Do you have any idea how to do this efficiently (actually I used loops ;-( ?
Best regards
Daniel

Hi Linda,
You can do it with color.legend in plotrix.

plot(1:10)
color.legend(1,8,7,8.5,align="rb",
rect.col=color.scale(1:21,c(0,1,0.5),c(0,1,0),c(0.5,1,0)),
legend=seq(-50,50,by=10))

Don't use <<- at the top level.  Use regular assignment, and things 
should be fine.

What is happening in your case is this:

1.  idebug <<- logical(5)

looks for idebug in the parents of the global environment, fails to find 
it, and creates a new one in the global environment.


2.  idebug[1] <<- TRUE

looks for idebug in the parents again, but this time it needs to find 
it, because you are trying to index it.  That's why you get an error on 
the second call.

I want to set NAs to 0 if the row names are e.g. 3

is OK but I wish to find out a more compact/shorter version.

for(i in 1:3)
{
bugvinP[,,i] <- ifelse(as.numeric(rownames(bugvinP[,,i])) < 3 &
is.na(bugvinP[,,i]), 0
, ifelse(as.numeric(rownames(bugvinP[,,i])) > 9 & is.na(bugvinP[,,i]),
1, bugvinP))
}


Thanks in advance

No (and it is confidence intervals not confidence bands that are 
unimplemented, and have been for years).

Doing what you ask (confidence bands) is very tricky indeed to do 
accurately (and is not what nlpredci says it does), and even accurate 
pointwise confidence intervals are problematic.  See MASS4 sections 
8.4/5 and its on-line complements for some details about why even 
confidence intervals for parameters are frequently tricky in non-linear 
models.

You could use resampling methods: see the reference in the previous 
paragraph.

Message-ID: <fb240dd50712040500h6e28785fh24ce1933955f71d8@mail.gmail.com>

I'm getting unexpected results from the coxph function when using
weights from counter-matching.  For example, the following code
produces a parameter estimate of -1.59 where I expect 0.63:

d2 = structure(list(x = c(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1,
1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1), wt = c(5, 42, 40, 4, 43, 4, 42,
4, 44, 5, 38, 4, 39, 4, 4, 37, 40, 4, 44, 5, 45, 5, 44, 5), riskset = c(1L,
1L, 4L, 4L, 6L, 6L, 12L, 12L, 13L, 13L, 19L, 19L, 23L, 23L, 31L,
31L, 42L, 42L, 45L, 45L, 70L, 70L, 93L, 93L), cc = c(1, 0, 1,
0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0
), pseudotime = rep(1,24)), .Names = c("x", "wt", "riskset",
"cc", "pseudotime"), class = "data.frame", row.names=1:24)

coxph( Surv(pseudotime, cc) ~ x + strata(riskset), weights=wt,
robust=T, method="breslow",data=d2)

I'm expecting a value of about 0.63 to 0.64 based on the data source
(simulated) and the following hand-coded MLE:

negloglik = function(beta,dat) {
  dat$wexb = dat$wt * exp(dat$x * beta)
  agged = aggregate(dat$wexb,list(riskset=dat$riskset),sum)
  names(agged)[2] = "denom"
  dat = merge(dat[dat$cc==1,],agged,by="riskset")
  -sum(log(dat$wexb)-log(dat$denom))
  }
nlm(negloglik,0,hessian=T,dat=d2)

Am I misunderstanding the meaning of case weights in the coxph
function?  The help file is pretty terse.

Hello,

can anybody help me with this problem?
I have a dataframe, which contains its values as factors though I have numbers 
but it was read as factors with "scan". Now I would like to convert these 
columns (multiple) to a numeric format.


# this example creates a similar situation

testdata <- as.factor(c("1.1",NA,"2.3","5.5"))
testdata2 <- as.factor(c("1.7","4.3","8.5",10.0))

df <- data.frame(testdata, testdata2)

what do I have to do to get the same datafram but with numeric values???

Dear R-Users,

I would like to know whether it is possible to draw several
stacked barplots (i.e. side by side on the same sheet)...


my data look like :

                            Cond1  Cond1' Cond2   Cond2'
Compartment 1    11,81    2,05    12,49    0,70   
Compartment 2     10,51    1,98    13,56    0,85
Compartment 3     1,95    0,63    2,81    0,22  
Compartment 4     2,08    0,17    3,13    0,06   
Compartment 5     2,51    0,20    4,58    0,03

ps: Cond1' values should be stacked on Cond1, Cond2' on Cond 2 and so 
on... and series 1 and 2
should be side by side for each compartement....

Thanks for any help.

St?phane.

I want to calculate means in the cells with respect to dimention 3rd so for
example (1+16+31)/3 or (15+30+45)/3  AND avoid taking zeros into account.

I did it with a loop but I guess there is the other more straightforward
method. will be very grateful for help...

See how result of cor.test() is organised by

str(your.result)

and pick up the value you want from list. See ...$estimate

Check the following example on xyplot/lattice:

barchart(yield ~ variety | site, data = barley,
         groups = year, layout = c(1,6), stack = TRUE, 
         auto.key = list(points = FALSE, rectangles = TRUE, space = "right"),
         ylab = "Barley Yield (bushels/acre)",
         scales = list(x = list(rot = 45)))

You have to reformat your data to the long format first for this, e.g. by using
reshape.

Comp  Cond  x
1     1     11.81
1     2      2.05

With allow.multiple=TRUE, it might be possible to avoid the reformatting, but I
never have used that form, because I the "long" had many advantages.

Subject: [R] Best forecasting methods with Time Series ?
References: <934356850712040428nb6e4879o48f5d649df0747f4@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <mn.21d37d7c5d1827ba.83239@exitcheck.net>

It depends on the nature of your data. Have you used the stl function 
to decompose your time series data?

plot(stl(time series, s.window="periodic"))

Are you looking at the ACF and PCF to see how strong the 
autocorrelations are? You may need to use a differencing operator to 
make your series stationary? Have you considered a box jenkins 
transformation of your data? (taking some kind of log of your data)

Also, what is a very useful measure that I'm not quite sure how to 
calculate in R, (I had to copy my fits into excel and compare with my 
actuals) is MAPE or Mean Average Proportional Error.

The formula looks like:

 SUM for i from 1 to n absolutevalue (1/n *(Actual_i-Fit_i)/Actual_i )

If youre MAPE is below 0.2 your model should be ok for forecasting. In 
my experience having it below 0.05 helps make better forecasts. MAPE 
isn't a perfect measure (I've found some literature on improved 
measures,) ideally you still want the AICC low but it helps figure out 
on average how by much your model is off. Sometimes ARIMA models can 
have a high MAPE but (relatively )low AICC.

Another model that you could use if there is a trend and seasonality is 
Holt Winters method. It's a fairly simple model that works However, 
your forecasts have to stay inside the seasonal length measure for the 
HW method or the bounds will become rediculously large.

If I knew how state space/GARCH models worked I'd let you know. Another 
list to check out is gmae.comp.lang.r.r-metrics

Hope that helps,

-Max

That looks rather dangerous. By the time I saw your suggestion, I had 
already added an extra variable with:

df$testdata1<-as.numeric(levels(df$testdata))[as.integer(df$testdata)]
 
When I tried your suggestion I got no error, but there was also no 
effect. When I tried:

df2<-sapply(df, function (x) as.numeric(levels(x))[as.integer(x)])

I discovered that the numeric variable, testdata1, had been entirely 
coverted to NA's and str(df2) did not look data.frame-like.

Subject: [R] 2/3d interpolation from a regular grid to another regular grid
Message-ID: <17EF7ABB-B4F8-4279-B9D0-620C02C91E84@gmail.com>

Hello R users,

I have numerical data sampled on two grids, each one shifted by 0.5  
from the other.

For example:

grid1 = expand.grid(x=0:3, y=0.5:2.5)
grid2 = expand.grid(x=0.5:2.5, y=0:3)
gridFinal = expand.grid(x=0.5:2.5, y=0.5:2.5)

plot(gridFinal, xlim=c(0,3), ylim=c(0,3), col="black", pch=19)
points(grid1, xlim=c(0,3), ylim=c(0,3), col="red", pch=19)
points(grid2, xlim=c(0,3), ylim=c(0,3), col="blue", pch=19)

I would like to interpolate the quantities on grid1 (red) and grid2  
(blue) on the same grid (black). This scenario is very common in  
geophysical data and models. I only found:
- functions in package akima which are designed for irregular grids
- krigging in package fields, which also requires irregular spaced data
- approx or spline which works in 1D and which I could apply line by  
line and column by column and use a mean of both estimates
I am sure there are plenty of functions already available to do this  
but searching R-help and the packages site did not help. Pointer to a  
function/package would be highly appreciated.

Eventually, the same scenario will occur in 3D so if the function is  
3D capable it would be a plus (but I am sure the solution to this is  
generic enough to work in nD)

Thank you in advance.

Subject: [R] Is R portable?
Message-ID: <47557A3F.9070502@psych.uib.no>

Recently I came across an interesting web site: 
http://portableapps.com/.  The idea is simple, this is software that 
is possible to install and run on some type of USB memory, a stick or 
one of these hard disks.  I can think of a number of situations where 
this could be handy.  In addition memory sticks are getting cheaper 
and more powerful by the day.

So:  Is it possible to run R off one of these sticks?

I am also informed that it is possible to run Latex in this manner.

At one time, the fact that colorspace used S4 classes was a problem for 
including it in base R.

my original reply was intended for the original version of 'df', in 
which both columns were factors. In your example you have added a 
numeric column, so not exactly the case I've replied for. For your 
example can use the following:

testdata <- as.factor(c("1.1",NA,"2.3","5.5"))
testdata2 <- as.factor(c("1.7","4.3","8.5",10.0))
df <- data.frame(testdata, testdata2)

df$testdata1 <- 
as.numeric(levels(df$testdata))[as.integer(df$testdata)]

fcts <- sapply(df, is.factor)
df[fcts] <- lapply(df[fcts], function (x) 
as.numeric(levels(x))[as.integer(x)])
df
str(df)


Best,
Dimitris

You could use a combination of rle, cumsum and append.

Use options(error=recover) to drop to the debugger when the error 
occurs, and you could examine the value of ratio0.  runif(1) should not 
give a 0, so log(runif(1)) should succeed.

Take the rle, fix up the result and take the invese.rle.  Our formula
adds 0's to the end too so remove those with head:

head(inverse.rle(with(rle(x), list(lengths = c(rbind(lengths, 3)),
values = c(rbind(values, 0))))), -3)

Hi,

I tried this method but it seems that there is something wrong with my 
data frame:


when I type in:

 > qplot(x=as.factor(Categorie),y=Total,data=mydata)

It displays a graph with 2 points in each category...
but if  I add the parameter geom="histogram"

 > qplot(x=as.factor(Categorie),y=Total,data=mydata,geom="histogram")


Error in storage.mode(test) <- "logical" :
        object "y" not found

any hint about this...

thx, St?phane.

On Windows anyway, R can be located in any directory including one on a
flash drive). R can also be set up to make no use of the registry (again --
Windows only), so AFAICS the answer is yes, and it's trivial to do. I would
be surprised if this were not true in other OS's, too. R is just an
executable with supporting libraries that can be located and run from
anywhere. Of course, various configuration details (file locations, language
environment, graphics options,...) must be set to agree with the particular
computer hardware and software on which the flash drive runs, but that is
inevitable (if R was told it should use a cyrillic character set for
Russian, it won't automatically switch to French when the flash drive is
stuck into a French computer).

If I am wrong about any of this, **PLEASE CORRECT**

Recently I came across an interesting web site:

is possible to install and run on some type of USB memory, a stick or 
one of these hard disks.  I can think of a number of situations where 
this could be handy.  In addition memory sticks are getting cheaper 
and more powerful by the day.

So:  Is it possible to run R off one of these sticks?

I am also informed that it is possible to run Latex in this manner.

Hope this helps,

Subject: [R] How can I use Adehabitat to obtain an .asc object with the
 predicted values of a niche model?
Message-ID: <14155047.post@talk.nabble.com>


Dear all,

I'm using the package adehabitat in R to import several .asc files
(=matrix), 
and also create a kasc object (=dataframe) with all of them.

The main idea is to use this kasc object to map the predicted values of
climate-matching model for an overall area. However, I don't know how to
proceed: Do I have to project the model (already stored in R) onto the kasc
object directly, or convert the kasc object to a data frame where each row
refers to a pixel?

On the other hand, I would also like to know how to obtain the XY
coordinates for each row of the kasc object. 

Thank you very much. Cheers,

N?ria Roura

Yes, it is indeed true for other systems as well, although
some configuration problems might arise, at least on Linux. 

It is also true that there are several small Linux distributions 
which easily fit into a flash drive, and then you can boot from the 
flash drive. I used to use SLAX, this is module based, ie. you can
choose which packages to install into the flash drive, and it has an R
package, although R version 2.2, so it is outdated. But i'm sure
there are more options, eg. Damn Small Linux is popular, i believe it
is desktop oriented, so might not contain R by default.

I used to install my whole Linux system into a small (ie. notebook)
USB harddisk, this is very comfortable, you just boot from the
harddisk and wehereever you are you get the same system (assuming you
can find a PC, but usually this is not a problem). It was a bit
slower, but much more comfortable than bringing a notebook with me
all the time. Until i accidentally kicked down the harddisk from the
desk...

Very nice but bit garish. :)

What about a dotchart instead?

 dotchart(x, labels=rownames(x),col=c(1:4), pch=16)

I simply installed R onto a USB stick, downloaded my
normal packages to it and it works fine under Windows.

Message-ID: <0C8C3AF3-C104-45A2-A2EA-9F3D896B0D86@umn.edu>

Hello:

I tried to install the latest R2.6.1 on my Mac OS X machines. I have  
no problems installing it on my Mac OS X Tigr machine. But when I  
tried to install it on other Mac OS X 10.4.9 PowerPCs, I could not  
have the GNU Fortran and/or Tcl/Tk libraries installed. I always got  
the error message : There were errors installing the software, please  
try installing again.

Does somebody have any idea what was going wrong? I had X11 installed  
on the machines, do I need to install other softwares before  
installing R?

Thanks!
-Shelley

Puh.  My apologies.  I should have done so before I asked the 
question.  Sorry.

Yes, on Windows, but

1) There are other OSes,

2) This didn't just happen: it needed some careful design, including some 
caching to make it run fast from a USB disk.


Unix-alike ports of R are not completely portable, as the path to R_HOME 
is encapsulated in the R and Rscript front ends.  So if on, say, Linux you 
want to plug in a USB disc then it will only work if you installed R to 
that USB disk mounted at the same location in the file system, or are 
prepared to edit the copies of the R script (which had therefore better be 
mounted read-write).

The standard MacOS build has standard paths encapsulated in many places.

which would be (roughly equivalent to)

qplot(X2, value, data=dfm, colour=X2, facets = . ~ X1)

in ggplot.

Could you copy and paste the output of dput(mydata) ?

(And I'd probably write the plot call as: qplot(Categorie, Total,
data=mydata, geom="bar"), since it is a bar plot, not a histogram)

Well I use them in ggplot2 :)  Unfortunately I've noticed that space =
"Lab" is much slower than space = "RGB" which is why I don't use Lab
space as a default.  And it also ignores alpha values, which is a bit
of a pain.

I find colour manipulation generally painful - all the really hard
stuff is there (i.e. conversion between colour spaces), but convenient
functions are lacking.   For example, I have this alpha function in
ggplot:

alpha <- function(colour, alpha) {
  col <- col2rgb(colour, TRUE) / 255
  col[4, ] <- rep(alpha, length(colour))

  new_col <- rgb(col[1,], col[2,], col[3,], col[4,])
  new_col[is.na(colour)] <- NA
  new_col
}

which seems like a lot of work for a simple task.  The fact that
col2rgb and rgb aren't symmetric is frustrating, especially since one
outputs values between 0 and 255 and the other (by default) accepts
inputs between 0 and 1.

It would definitely be nice if all colour space manipulations were
merged into a single package, with a consistent interface.  I would
happily contribute to such a project, since I do a lot of colour
manipulation in ggplot.

Hi Roy:

Thank you for your quick response! I checked the softlink and I did  
see: /usr/local/ -> /private/var/automount/usr/local

 From the post I read: "I'm not quite sure what to do with this".  
What does it mean? It means there is no way to install the Tcl/Tk  
libraries on my powerPCs? I want to use it.

-Shelley

Message-ID: <200712041829.CIL37122@md2.mail.umd.edu>

My apologies, I was wrong with z$p.value. That is not what you wanted. I
should not write email at 3:30 :) But I think z$statistic as suggested by
Peter is not it either. You said you want the rho. The code for it is
z$estimate, assuming that you used method="spearman" to get a rho . Please
look below. It is othervariable3 that you want. So to get it (hopefully)
fully right once:

x=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
y=c(3,5,4,6,7,8,8,7,10)

z=cor.test(x,y,method="spearman")

z
othervariable=z$p.value
othervariable2=z$statistic
othervariable3=z$estimate

You can get help for the function by typing ?cor.test . This shows you the
available values returned by cor.test that you can easily assign to other
variables.

Look to see if you have a link in /usr/local that links /usr/local/ib  
to  "/usr/local/lib 1".  it is that which is causing the problems.   
In the link below, Simon gives 2 commands that remove the link and  
renames the library location.  Then the install works.

Hi Roy:

I don't know where Simon found the "/usr/local/lib 1". I checked  
everywhere but could not find it. There is a softlink links "/usr/ 
bin/ to "/private/var/automount/usr/local", but no softlink links "/ 
usr/bin/local" to other place.

  Maybe (untested)

  distfun <- function(i,j) { (x1[i]-x2[j])^2 + (y1[i]-y2[j])^2) }
outer(i,j,distfun)

We just studied randomized block design analysis in my statistics class,
and I'm trying to learn how to do them in R. I'm trying to duplicate a
case study example from my textbook [1]:

I don't understand why R doesn't output a value for F and Pr for the
Error (Block) dimension, as my textbook shows 12.807 and 0.0015
respectively. All the other numbers match. Can these two values be
recovered? Also, my text shows a total line which R omits. Is this
because it's not particularly useful?

Thanks for your suggestions and advice. Also, if I'm executing this type
of problem in R inefficiently, I'd appreciate suggestions.

> - krigging in package fields, which also requires irregular spaced data

That kriging requires irregularly spaced data sounds new to me ;) It
cannot be, you misread something (I feel free to say that even if I
never used that package).
It can be tricky doing kriging, though, if you're not comfortable with
a little bit of geostatistics. You have to infer a variogram model for
each data set; you possibly run into non-stationarity or anisotropy,
which are indeed very well treated (maybe at best) by kriging in one
of its forms, but ... it takes more than this list to help you then;
basically kriging requires modelling, so it is often very difficult to
set up an automatic procedure. I can reccomend kriging if the spatial
variability of your data (compared to grid refinement) is quite
important.

In other simple cases, a wheighted mean using the (squared) inverse of
the distance as wheight and a spherical neighbourhood could be the
simpliest way to perform the interpolation.

It's a good thought.
There is some thought going into standardizing, if 
you look at

http://developer.R-project.org/sRGB-RFC.html

and by the way, for a previous post, it's inaccurate to call Lab
"perceptual", although many people do.  It's based on discrimination data
in an attempt to make a uniform space for small color differences, 
but it is only approximately so.

best,

Ken

Nice to discover good planning.  Am I then correct in my
understanding: Installing R under Windows does not require any
registry entries, the installation is essentially to unpack the
necessary files in the correct directories?

You can get the answer you want with

coxph(Surv(pseudotime, cc)~x+strata(riskset)+offset(log(wt)), data=d2, robust=TRUE)

which is how countermatching usually seems to be done, and is what the 
original paper by Langholz & Borgan recommends.

I think it's right that weight=wt doesn't do the same thing.  The weights 
are not simple inverse-probability sampling weights, because the sampling 
units in this design are pairs, not individuals.  If we assume the 
distribution of x is the same across risk sets (which looks approximately 
true in your data) then the sampling weight for a pair is proportional to 
the number of eligible controls: ie, just your control weight.  Using 
these as weights for the pairs in the weight= argument I get 0.585 as the 
hazard ratio, reasonably close to your 0.63 given that this is a different 
estimator and given the assumptions.

Yes.  It does record some information in the registry, but that's purely 
optional.  The only problem you're likely to run into is using external 
software with R, that might look in the registry to find where R was 
installed.

Let's be careful here. aov() treats block as a **random** error component of
variance.  lm() treats block as a **fixed effect**. That's a different
kettle of fish. Perhaps both Kevin and the authors of his textbook need to
read up on fixed versus random effects and what they mean -- and what sorts
of tests make sense for each.

This seems to work.
The trick is to use 'lm' instead of 'aov'.

> dim(A) <- 10
> A

Would it not make sense to have dim(A) = length(A) for all vectors?

I think coxph() leaves safe prediction off by default. You need to turn it 
on.

In R, vectors don't have dimensions, arrays do.

Sorry for the misdirection, I see now that you are describing survreg() 
not coxph().

But even coxph() seems to barf on this.

A possible workaround:

This was wrong. It is not invariant to the choice of the discarded value.

I guess it is time to study up on safe prediction. It is obvious I am 
missing something.

  Note that Kevin didn't send the last message, "T.K." did.
My copies of ISwR and MASS are either at work or loaned
out, so please forgive confusion in the following ... but ...

# Case Study 13.2.1, page 778
cd <- c(8, 11, 9, 16, 24)
dp <- c(2, 1, 12, 11, 19)
lm <- c(-2, 0, 6, 2, 11)
table <- data.frame(Block=LETTERS[1:5],
                    "Score changes"=c(cd, dp,
                      lm), Therapy=rep(c("Contact Desensitization",
                             "Demonstration Participation",
                             "Live Modeling"), each=5)) 

model.aov <- aov(Score.changes ~ Therapy + Error(Block), data=table) 
summary(model.aov)

m1 = summary(model.aov)
str(m1)  ## looking at the guts

## not particularly friendly! but this will do it.
## the first element of the list is the block error info
## the second is the within-block info

blockmeansq = m1[["Error: Block"]][[1]][["Mean Sq"]]
errmeansq =   m1[["Error: Within"]][[1]][["Mean Sq"]][2]

fval = blockmeansq/errmeansq ## 109.5/8.55
blockdf = m1[["Error: Block"]][[1]][["Df"]] ## 4
errdf =   m1[["Error: Within"]][[1]][["Df"]][2] ## 8
pf(fval,df1=blockdf,df2=errdf,lower.tail=FALSE)

  In this particular case, the fixed-effect model and the RCB
design will give the same p-values:

bad.aov <- aov(Score.changes ~ Therapy + Block, data=table) 
summary(bad.aov)

BUT THIS IS NOT TO BE RELIED UPON IN GENERAL!

You can also use lme [nlme package]  or lmer [lme4 package],
which can do much more complicated models.


library(nlme)
m2 = lme(Score.changes ~ Therapy, random = ~1|Block, data=table)
anova(m2)

detach("package:nlme")
library(lme4)
m3 = lmer(Score.changes ~ Therapy+(1|Block), data=table)
anova(m3)

Subject: [R] Calculating large determinants
Message-ID: <4455.203.173.149.245.1196817503.squirrel@webmail.scms.waikato.ac.nz>

I apologise for not including a reproducible example with this query but I
hope that I can make things clear without one.

I am fitting some finite mixture models to data. Each mixture component
has p parameters (p=29 in my application) and there are q components to
the mixture. The number of data points is n ~ 1500.

I need to select a good q and I have been considering model selection
methods suggested in Chapter 6 of
@BOOK{mp01,
  author    = {McLachlan, G. J. and Peel, D.},
  title     = {Finite Mixture Models},
  publisher = {Wiley},
  address   = {New York},
  year      = {2001}
}

One of these methods involves an "empirical information matrix" which is
the matrix of products of parameter scores at the observation level
evaluated at the MLE and summed over all observations. For example a
six-component mixture will have 6 - 1 + 29*6 = 179 parameters. So for
observation i I form the 179 by 179 matrix of products of scores and sum
these up over all 1500-odd observations.

Actually it is the log of the determinant of the resultant matrix that I
really need rather than the matrix itself. I am seeking advice on what may
be the best way to evaluate this log(det()). I have been encountering
problems using
determinant(SS,logarithm=TRUE)

and   eigen(SS,only.values = TRUE)$values

shows some negative eigenvalues.

Advice will be gratefully received!

Presumably because the primary requirement for packages being
accepted on CRAN is that they pass "R CMD check".  This is a fine
minimum standard -- it means that packages will definitely install --
but there's nothing to stop anyone posting a package full of
statistical nonsense to CRAN, as far as I know.   I'm _not_ suggesting
that R-core should take up this challenge, but this is where ratings
come in.

Numbers 1 to 3 are critical.  The rest would be very nice to know (and
should be part of a rating
system), but in the end are more likely to lead to frustration than outright
errors ... (i.e., you'll
find out soon enough if a package is poorly documented, then you just won't
use it).

Gad,

I think I have it now.

survreg does not automatically place the boundary knots in its $terms 
component.

You can force this by hand:


> range(ovarian$age)
[1] 38.8932 74.5041
> s <- survreg(Surv(futime, fustat) ~ ns(age, knots=c(50, 60),Boundary.knots=c(38.8932, 74.5041)),data=ovarian)

       [,1]

> all.preds.2 <- sapply(ovarian$age,function(x) predict(s,newdata=data.frame(age=x)))
> all.equal(all.preds,all.preds.2)
[1] TRUE

Hard coding the boundary knots as above will assure that predict will work 
even if the data.frame used in making the fit is unavailable.

Subject: [R] converting factors to dummy variables
Message-ID: <ca5a2f2e0712041939p4739d879m9b51ab21c08d5e30@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all -

I'm trying to find a way to create dummy variables from factors in a
regression.  I have been using biglm along the lines of

ff <- log(Price) ~ factor(Colour):factor(Store) +
factor(DummyVar):factor(Colour):factor(Store)

lm1 <- biglm(ff, data=my.dataset)

but because there are lots of colours (>100) and lots of stores
(>250), I run it to memory problems.  Now, not every store sells every
colour and so it should be possible to create the matrix of factor
variables myself and greatly reduce the size of the problem.  it seems
that lm / biglm use all combinations of factor levels when used in
factor(Colour):factor(Store) so by creating my own matrix of factor
variables i should be able to reduce the size of the problem
considerably.

If i have a data frame
>my.dataset <- data.frame(Price=1:12, Colour= c('red','blue','green'),
Store=c('a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'b', 'e'),
DummyVar = sort(rep(c(0,1),6)) )

i want to create a data frame with the dummy vars that looks like

red:a	red:e	blue:b	blue:c	blue:e	green:c	green:d	green:e
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0
1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0
0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0
0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

any ideas would be appreciated.

I can install hdf5 smoothly. I am using R2.5.0 on WinXP-32bit machine.


>> configure: error: Can't find HDF5

It looks u r using x86_64 machine. Maybe u need install hdf5 from source code.
I have been install hdf5 on both CentOS and Fedora, no error messages.

You indicate that the ODBC connection to Teradata on Windows is working for
you.  This may be a newbie question, but I'm not getting beyond an
apparently successful connection to the Teradata...

Apparently there are some data conversion errors... do data types need to be

Use

mat <- model.matrix( ~ClrStr-1,
 	transform( my.dataset, ClrStr =
 		factor( paste(Colour,Store,sep=":") ) ) )

then pretty up the colnames() and re-order columns if order matters.

----

However, if DummyVar is a categorical variable, you could just compute 
means on the appropriate subsets by maintaining a table of sums and 
totals. Then in a second pass through the data get the residual sums of 
squares. If the data are already in a database, it might make sense to do 
these operations there and import the results to R for further massaging.

That's not quite true.  Package BRugs will go halfway through the
installation before a Linux user is given the information that it will
not work with Linux.  The automated way the packages are listed
doesn't manage to collect that bit of information (and that's nothing
anyone should be ashamed of).  

Somewhere for adding information such as that could help avoid the
need for many people finding that out for themselves.

Subject: [R] pointwise nonparametric estimation of odds-ratios of continuous
 predictors
Message-ID: <14165792.post@talk.nabble.com>


Dear listers,

I am doing an time-series analysis on the relationship fo daily air
pollutants and mortality using generalized additive models. I have two
questions as followed:

Question 1:
How can I get the relative risk estimates from the smoothing spines ? I have
found a paper which focused on this problem. The paper is "np.OR: an s-plus
function for pointwise nonparametric estimation of odds ratios of continuous
predictors". Please see the attached files.

Question 2: 
Is there some functions in package mgcv ? If not, can I use the method
described in the above reference?

Thanks a lot in advance

No.  A one-dimensional array and a vector are not the same thing.
There are subtle differences, such as what names() means (see ?names).

That a 1D array and a vector _print_ in the same way does occasionally 
lead to confusion, but then you also cannot tell from your printout that A 
has type "integer" and not "double".

The bioconductor packages have the DESCRIPTION file's SystemRequirements
field listed on the net so you can know what they are prior to
downloading the file.
For CRAN packages this information seems not to be shown on the net.

Subject: [R] bootstrapping on the growth curve
In-Reply-To: <470371.39045.qm@web32805.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi, I am trying to get 95% CI s around a quantile growth curve, but  
my result looks strange to me.

Here is the function I defined myself

boot.qregress<-function(mat1, group,  quantile, int, seed.1){

     boot.fit<-NULL
     set.seed(seed.1)
     for (i in 1:int){

     index<-sample((unique(mat1$Subject[mat1$Group==group])), length 
(unique(mat1$Subject[mat1$Group==group])), replace=TRUE)

     #make the bootstrapping dataset
     mat.junk<-NULL
     for (j in 1: length(index)){

         mat.junk<-rbind(mat.junk, mat1[mat1$Subject==index[j], ])	
     	}

    boot.fit<-cbind(boot.fit, cobs(mat.junk$Day, mat.junk$Weight,   
constraint="none",  degree=2, tau=quantile, lambda=-1)$fitted)	
     	
    	}

    boot.fit 	

}


The curves I made from the bootstrapping is attached, I don't  
understand why for a group, the 5% curve drops suddenly around time  
130. I am thinking about missingness since before 130 there are 50  
patients, but after day 130 there are only 40 patients for this group.

Any suggestions on the R-code (especially about how to do the  
bootstrapping for the growth curves) or why the drops happened would  
be appreciated.

Thanks a lot,

Suyan

Good morning,

I read (and occasionally post to) R-Help through nabble.com
(http://www.nabble.com/R-f13819.html) and there is a rating system there by
post rather than by author.

Message boards (e.g. www.boards.ie amongst many others) note on each message
how many posts that a person has made since they joined the board.

Best Regards,
Sean

which is a problem?
In that case I guess your problem is that you want to estimate a
positive definite matrix S but your estimate S^ is not quite
positive definite.

Function posdefify() in CRAN package "sfsmisc" provides an old
cheap solution to this problem,
where  nearPD() in package 'Matrix' (based on a donation from
Jens Oehlschlaegel) provides a more sophisticated algorithm for
this problem.

If you really only need the eigenvalues of the "corrected"
matrix, you might want to abbreviate the nearPD() function by
just returning the final 'd' vector of eigenvalues.

    MJ> Advice will be gratefully received!

I'll be glad to hear if and how you'd use one of these two functions.

Subject: [R] Plotting error bars in xy-direction
Message-ID: <loom.20071205T094247-719@post.gmane.org>

Dear R-help,

I am looking for a function that will plot error bars in x- or y-direction (or 
both), the same as the Gnuplot function 'plot' can achieve with:

    plot "file.dat" with xyerrorbars,...

Rsite-searching led me to the functions 'errbar' and 'plotCI' in the Hmisc, 
gregmisc, and plotrix packages. As I understand the descriptions and examples, 
none of these functions provides horizontal error bars.

Looking into 'errbar' and using segments, I wrote a small function for myself 
adding these kinds of error bars to existing plots. I would still be interested 
to know what the standard R solution is.

Regards,  Hans Werner

Try this also:

table(cbind.data.frame(Price=my.dataset$Price,
Colour=paste(my.dataset$Colour, my.dataset$Store, sep=":")))

Of Krigging I only know the name and general intent so I gladly line  
up to your opinion.
I just read the description in ?Krig in the package fields which says:
" Fits a surface to irregularly spaced data. "
But there are probably other Krigging methods I overlooked.

This was the impression I had too: that Krigging is an art in itself  
and that it requires you to know much about your data. My problem is  
simpler: the variability is not very large between grid points (it is  
oceanic current velocity data so it is highly auto-correlated  
spatially) and I can get grids fine enough for variability to be low  
anyway. So it is really purely numerical.

Yes, that would be largely enough for me. I had C routines for 2D  
polynomial interpolation of a similar cases and low order polynomes  
gave good results. I just hoped that R had that already coded  
somewhere in an handy and generic function rather than having to  
recode it myself in a probably highly specialized and not reusable  
manner.

Thank you very much for you answer and if someone knows a function  
doing what is described above, that would be terrific.

Yes.  It does record some information in the registry, but that's purely
optional.  The only problem you're likely to run into is using external
software with R, that might look in the registry to find where R was
installed.

This is not primarily an R question: if you tell us how you want to define 
it, we may be able to help you compute it.  I presume you are talking 
about Schwarz (1978), which is not billed as an 'information criterion'.

AFAIK, all Gideon Schwarz did was to define a criterion for linear 
regression.  People have applied it to other situations with a vector 
space of parameters.  However in many clustering methods (including 
kmeans, and as for example in classification trees) there is also a 
combinatorial part of the fit: you optimize over both the cluster centres 
and the allocation of units to clusters.  It does not come close to the 
Schwarz framework.

Nor does clustering fit into Akaike (1973, 1974)'s information framework.

There is discussion in Banfield & Raftery (1993) of a Schwarz-like 
criterion for clustering, but with a rather different derivation and I 
don't think it should be attributed to Schwarz.

Subject: [R] Help installing taskPR
Message-ID: <E117AD245282BA48ABE1E16E9712070C0C5A100817@UOS-CL-EX7-L3.soton.ac.uk>

Hello,

I'd like to take a look at how the taskPR package performs on our computational cluster, and this morning I've spend some time trying to do a test install of this package on one of our linux machines. Unfortunately I've been unsuccessful in completing the install, and I wondered if someone could please advise me.

As I've noted I working on a linux machine, and it's running RHEL 4.0. I've build the lam package (we're very familiar with all the mpi libraries and so that is not an issue), and then I attempted to install taskPR...

A). I added the lam binaries to my command search PATH
B). Defined CC=mpicc
C). Started R, and tried the install using
install.packages(c("taskPR_0.2.7.tar.gz"), repos=NULL, configure.args= c(taskPR="--with-mpi='/usr/local/lam-7.1.4'"))

The configure/install fails, and I've appended the output below. I can understand why it's failing, however I don't understand how to fix the problem. Could anyone please shead any light on this issue.

Thanks & Regards,

David Baker.

Hello All,

I don't know if help, but I find a package written in Java and .NET that
have a implementation of tramo/seats.
The link http://www.nbb.be/app/dqrd/index.htm

If I have more information I will post it.

Thanks for the reply s, they really help!

Message-ID: <68b1e2610712050402s21370c39o4b89b51f7dd3b2c9@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I have several problems with exporting to LaTeX the output of
numSummary() from the abind package.

> numSummary(finance[,"Cash_flow"], statistics=c("mean", "sd", "quantiles"))
     mean       sd      0%   25%   50%      75%    100%  n NA
 188070.9 414771.9 -426804 26743 53866 150975.5 1871500 54  4

> xtable(numSummary(finance[,"Cash_flow"], statistics=c("mean", "sd", "quantiles")))
Error in UseMethod("xtable") : no applicable method for "xtable"

> latex(numSummary(finance[,"Cash_flow"], statistics=c("mean", "sd", "quantiles")))

The latter gives me much more verbose error messages (please see the
attached log). Checking the temporary files, I found the tex code
generated by latex() and tried it in LyX, but the document fails to
compile.

Could anyone please suggest either (1) alternative commands to latex()
or xtable() or (2) a way to tweak the latter commands so that these
work with numSummary()?

Thanks in advance,
Liviu

I guess it will help to fix some terminology first.  In my book,
"inconsistent constraints" are constraints that cannot be fulfilled
simultaneously, e.g. something like "x_1 <= 3" and "x_1 >= 5" for an
obvious example.  Thus, a problem with inconsistent constraints cannot
be solved, regardless of the rank of the constraint matrix.  (Anyway,
that matrix is typically not square, so would be be talking about full
column rank or full row rank?)

Of course, it can happen that the constraints are consistent but that 
there are some redundancy in the specified constraints, e.g. a simply
case would be "x_1 >= 0", "x_2 >= 0" and "x_1+x_2 >= 0"; if the first
two constraints are fulfilled, then the last one is automatically
fulfilled too. In my experience, it can happen that solve.QP comes to
the conclusion that a constraint that ought to be fulfilled, given the
constraints that have already been enforced, is deemed to be violated
and to be inconsistent with the constraints already enforced. In that
case solve.QP stops, rather misleadingly, with the message that the
constraints are inconsistent.  

I guess the package should be worked over by someone with a better
understanding of the kind of fudges that do not come back to bite and of
finite precision arithmetic than the original author's appreciation of
such issues when the code was written. ;-))

It is a bit unclear to me what you call the constant term.  Is it `d'?
In that case, it does not perturb the constraints and it is irrelevant
for the minimizer of f(x); also for the minimizer of f(x) under linear
constraints.  Regardless of d, the solution is always the same.  I do
not know of any quadratic programming solver that allows `d' as input,
probably because it is irrelevant for determining the solution of the
problem.

> Can anyone help me, PLEASEEEEEEE?

In my experience, rescaling the problem might help, i.e. use Q* = Q/2
and D*=D/2 instead of the original Q and D; but do not forget to
rescale the constraints accordingly.  

Or you might want to try another quadratic program solver in R, e.g.
ipop() in package kernlab.

Hope this helps.

Best wishes,

I don't think this is referring to the nls2 package on CRAN but
rather something else.

You mean the package nls2 at

http://w3.jouy.inra.fr/unites/miaj/public/AB/nls2/install.html

and not the unfortunately named nls2 that has just appeared on CRAN?

The first is not really a 'package' in the R sense.

On CRAN: the current version has

Package: rgdal
Title: Bindings for the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library
Version: 0.5-20
Date: 2007-11-07
Depends: R (>= 2.3.0), methods, sp

Or were you looking for a binary version for an unstated platform?  (A 
Windows binary is there and should be available via the Rgui menus.)

I suggest you ask the maintainer (as does the posting guide).

Red Hat headers for mpi are in a different layout from the sources, and 
recent versions of mpi from earlier ones.  But the path to mpi.h (which I 
guess is /usr/local/lam-7.1.4/include in your setup) is missing.  You 
might try adding it to the packages' PKG_CPPFLAGS or to C_INCLUDE_PATH.

I suspect you will then have problems with the libs.  One I have is that 
the lam libs built from sources need -lutil, and Rmpi and taskPR do not 
allow for that.

There are a lot of other problems with this package: one is that it 
includes a long-outdated (>2.5 years) copy of the private R header Defh.h 
that is incompatible with the current Rinternals.h

As a result the package is basically skipped (a fake install is used) in 
the CRAN checks and I am pretty sure it is not going to work with recent 
versions of R without very extensive changes.

  I agree with Thomas' answer wrt using offset instead of weight.  One way to 
understand this is to look at the score equation for the Cox model, which is
  	sum over the deaths of (x[i] - xbar[i])
x[i] is the covariate vector of the ith death
xbar[i] is the average of all the subjects who were at risk at the time of the 
ith death.

  In situations where one samples selected controls, the score equation will be 
correct if one fixes up xbar so that it is an estimate of the population mean 
(all those in the population that were at risk for a death) rather than being 
the mean of just those in the sample.  Use of an offset statement allows one to 
reweight xbar without changing the rest of the score equation.  It's kind of a 
trick, see Therneau and Li, Lifetime Data Analysis, 1999, p99-112 for a simple 
example of how it works.  Langholz and Borgan give details on exactly how to 
correctly reweight using some old results from sampling theory - it is just a 
little bit more subtle than one would guess, but not too different from the 
obvious.

You need to look at the digits argument of xtable that would allow you
to control this i think.

 I have not yet understood how to set the number of displayed digits
 after the period (not sure how to express correctly in English) in the
 exported TeX code. For example, I would like to make all numbers
 display as integers. Or, I would like to have 123.00 numbers display
 as integers and the rest 123.212(3) display as 123.21. Do you know how
 this is done within R? (I understand that I can perfectly do this
 manually in the TeX code).

 Thanks in advance,

Hi,

I am attempting to solve a Mixed Integer Non Linear Program using R.
I am aware of the GLPK package that solved mixed integer linear
programs, and the Rdonlp2 package that solve linear programs.
Is there any package that that solves the MINLP case?

Any info or pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Well, the R help page  ?colorRamp

in its 'examples' section
has an example of this Matlab-lik color scheme, calling them
'jet.colors', easily constructed with the nice
colorRampPalette() function [I've just posted about to R-help as well].

Please say
       
       example(colorRamp)
in R
and slowly watch the output, and I expect you will never ever
want to use the horrible "Matlab-like" color palette again..

Hi Murray,

A likely reason for the observed information matrix not to be positive
definite is the inaccuracies in the numerical estimation of the scores.  You
might want to try more accurate methods (e.g. Richardson extrapolation) for
approximating numerical derivatives, such as available in the package
"numDeriv".   This would likely alleviate your problem.  

Please disregard my advice, if you are using analytical, closed-form
expressions for the scores.  In this case, you might try the approaches
suggested by Martin.

Ravi.

which is a problem?
In that case I guess your problem is that you want to estimate a
positive definite matrix S but your estimate S^ is not quite
positive definite.

Function posdefify() in CRAN package "sfsmisc" provides an old
cheap solution to this problem,
where  nearPD() in package 'Matrix' (based on a donation from
Jens Oehlschlaegel) provides a more sophisticated algorithm for
this problem.

If you really only need the eigenvalues of the "corrected"
matrix, you might want to abbreviate the nearPD() function by
just returning the final 'd' vector of eigenvalues.

    MJ> Advice will be gratefully received!

I'll be glad to hear if and how you'd use one of these two functions.

Hello,

I'm searching for a method which maps variables of this kind of table, see below, to 2-dimensional space, like in multidimensional scaling. However, this table is asymmetric: for example, variable T1 affects T2 more than T2 affects T1(0.41 vs. 0.21). 

> DEPTABLE
     T1    T2     T3    T4
T1 0.00 0.41 0.24 1.18
T2 0.21 0.00 0.46 0.12
T3 0.80 0.89 0.00 0.20
T4 0.09 1.04 0.17 0.00

Any suggestions? Something like gplot+mds+weighted arrays?

Message-ID: <4756C0E2.1060902@unifi.it>

Dear R-users.
I eventually bought myself a new computer with the following 
characteristics:

Processor AMD ATHLON 64 DUAL CORE 4000+ (socket AM2)
Mother board ASR SK-AM2 2
Ram Corsair Value 1 GB DDR2 800 Mhz
Hard Disk WESTERN DIGITAL 160 GB SATA2 8MB

I'm a newcomer to the Linux world.
I started using it (Ubuntu 7.10 at work and FC4 on laptop) on a regular 
basis on May.
I must say I'm quite comfortable with it, even if I have to re-learn a 
lot of things.  But this is not a problem, I will improve my knowledge 
with time.

My main problem now, is that I installed Ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy Gibbon on the 
new one amd64.

To install R on it i followed the directions found here
http://help.nceas.ucsb.edu/index.php/Installing_R_on_Ubuntu

but unfortunately it did not work.

After reading some posts on the R-SIG-debian list, such as

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-debian/2007-October/000253.html

I immediately realize that an amd64 is not the right processor to make 
life easy.

Therefore I would like to know from you, how can I solve this problem:
Should I install the i386 version of R ?
Should I install another flavour of Linux ?
Which one ?
Fedora Core 7 ?
Debian ?

Thanks a lot, for any suggestion

And qplot(x=Categorie,y=Total,data=mydata,geom="bar",fill=Part) + coord_flip()

makes it a bit easier to read the labels.

Hi,

I've got an Athlon 64bits 3000+ processor and Ubuntu LTS (dapper) 
installed (64 bits version) on my laptop. I do not have any problem to 
install R from the sources, as long as the correct 
libraries/compilers/etc. are installed. But it is no pain if you just 
follow what the configure script tells you (and use apt-get to install 
missing packages). I guess a common mistake is to forget to install 
"-dev" versions of packages, which sometimes contain required headers. 
However, you should not have troubles installing R on different R 
distributions, 64bits or not.

Hope this help.

Thibaut, 64bit-linux-Ruser and still alive.

Yes, that is the most general case. Regular data location is a subset
of irregular. Anyway, kriging, just one g, after the name of Danie
Krige, the south african statistician who first applied such method
for minig survey.

Of course R has ... ;) If your grids are really as simple as the
example you posted above, and you have a really little variability,
all you need is a "moving average", the arithmetic mean of the two
nearest points belonging to grid1 and grid2 respectively. I assume
that your regularly shaped grids are values stored in matrix objects.

The functions comes from the "diff.default" code (downloading the R
source code, I assure, is worth):

my.interp <- function(x, lag = 1)
{
    r <- unclass(x)  # don't want class-specific subset methods
    i1 <- -1:-lag
    r <- (r[i1] + r[-length(r):-(length(r)-lag+1)])/2
    class(r) <- oldClass(x)
    return(r)
}

Finally,

g1 <- apply(grid1val,1,my.interp)
g2 <- apply(grid2val,2,my.interp)

give the interpolations on gridFinal, provided that all gridFinal
points are within the grid1 and grid2 ones.

If you want the mean from 4 points, you apply once more with lag=3,
cbind/rbind to the result columns/rows o NAs, and you calculate the
mean of the points of the two matrixes.
This is the simplest (and quickest) moving average that you can do.
For more complicated examples, and for 3d, you have to go a little
further, but the principle holds.

plotCI from plotrix will do horizontal error bars --
from ?plotCI:

  err: The direction of error bars: "x" for horizontal, "y" for
          vertical ("xy" would be nice but is not implemented yet;
          don't know quite how everything would be specified.  See
          examples for composing a plot with simultaneous horizontal
          and vertical error bars)

Subject: [R] Java parser for R data file?
Message-ID: <C37C3903.56%david@incogen.com>

Hi everyone,

Has anyone written a parser in Java for either the ASCII or binary format
produced by save()? I need to parse a single large 2D array that is
structured like this:

list(
  "32609_1" = c(-9549.39231289146, -9574.07159324482, ... ),
  "32610_2" = c(-6369.12526971635, -6403.99620977124, ... ),
  "32618_2" = c(-2138.29095689061, -2057.9229403233, ... ),
        ...
)

Or, given that I'm dealing with just a single array, would it be better to
roll my own I/O using write.table or write.matrix from the MASS package?

Thanks,
David

What did not work? Provide some information more...
By the way, isn't 'gfortran' the new GNU fortran compiler which
replaced 'g77'? Or not on Ubuntu?

??? Example of bad extrapolation ;)

> Should I install the i386 version of R ?

I assume you are talking about installing from source. You installed
the i386 version of Ubuntu? Then yes. Else no.

But rather let apt-get do it for you. Just install the binary provided
by the Ubuntu community. It is the best way to get things working and
avoid problems.

> Should I install another flavour of Linux ?

It depends. Ubuntu is good to start, and has the widest users base;
Archlinux my best choice (but you need to be already somewhat
advanced).

Hi Murray,

A likely reason for the observed information matrix not to be positive
definite is the inaccuracies in the numerical estimation of the scores.  You
might want to try more accurate methods (e.g. Richardson extrapolation) for
approximating numerical derivatives, such as available in the package
"numDeriv".   This would likely alleviate your problem.  

Please disregard my advice, if you are using analytical, closed-form
expressions for the scores.  In this case, you might try the approaches
suggested by Martin.

It is also likely that your likelihood is quite flat around the MLE, which,
of course, means that you don't have enough information in your data to
separate the mixtures and estimate 179 parameters.  Have you tried
estimating with fewer mixture components and then working your way up?
Also, with this many parameters and relatively few data points, can you
ensure that you have a "global" maximum?  


Ravi.

which is a problem?
In that case I guess your problem is that you want to estimate a
positive definite matrix S but your estimate S^ is not quite
positive definite.

Function posdefify() in CRAN package "sfsmisc" provides an old
cheap solution to this problem,
where  nearPD() in package 'Matrix' (based on a donation from
Jens Oehlschlaegel) provides a more sophisticated algorithm for
this problem.

If you really only need the eigenvalues of the "corrected"
matrix, you might want to abbreviate the nearPD() function by
just returning the final 'd' vector of eigenvalues.

    MJ> Advice will be gratefully received!

I'll be glad to hear if and how you'd use one of these two functions.

Hi Ottorino,

I have been using R on 64-bit Ubuntu for about a year without
problems, both Intel and AMD CPUs. Installing and using several
packages (e1071, svmpath, survival) also works. However, I had to
install R from source:

$ gunzip -c R-2.6.1.tar.gz | tar xvf -
$ cd R-2.6.1
$ ./configure --enable-R-shlib; make; make pdf
# make install; make install-pdf

Notice that `make install' has to be run as root.

I am using Feisty Fawn (Ubuntu 7.04), although I doubt that makes a
difference.

Hope this helps,

Ljubomir

Hi --

I just noticed the following (R 2.6.1 on OSX)

This is a bit surprising.. Why does lapply unclass the object?  Sorry for 
such a basic question, I don't seem able to produce the right google keywords.

Amd64 architecture should not be a major issue for R on any of the major
platforms, as far as I know. I have Fedora 7 (soon-ish F8) on the "big"
machine back home (dual Opteron) and that one never had any major issues
with either of source builds or the "official" RPMs. The main (only?)
thing that still tends to bite people on 64 bit is browser plugins,
notably Java.

In general, I've been happy with Fedora, although its desire to update
itself constantly does require a good 'Net connection.

My SUSE desktop at work is also 64 bit and happy to deal with R (in fact
the official release builds are made on it). The KDE desktop has a few
annoying misfeatures (to me), though, and you need a little special
setup to include Detlefs repository as an install source.

One oddity about Ubuntu is that there are no CRAN builds for 64bit.
Presumably, the Debian packages work, or you can get the build script
and make your own build. This is not really within my domain, though.

It would be much easier.  The save() format is far more complex than you 
need.  However, I would use writeBin() to write a binary file and read 
that in in Java, avoiding the binary -> ASCII -> binary conversion.

Note that Ottorino has only 1GB of RAM installed, which makes a 64-bit 
version of R somewhat moot.  See chapter 8 of

http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html

I would install a i386 version of R on x86_64 Linux unless I had 2Gb or 
more of RAM.  I don't know how easily that works on Ubuntu these days, but 
I would try it.

Did you not read the help page?:

Arguments:

        X: a vector (atomic or list) or an expressions vector.  Other
           objects (including classed objects) will be coerced by
           'as.list'.

and

> as.list(c(as.Date('2007-01-01')))
[[1]]
[1] 13514

BTW, the c() is redundant here: you are concatenating one item only.

As to why as.list() removes the class, read its help page which tells you.

Perhaps if you told us what you are trying to achieve we might be able to 
help you achieve it.

I have a function which takes a date as an argument.  I've tested it, and 
I'd like to run it over a range of dates.  So I'm looking at apply- or

I think you did not understand ecdf() !!!
It *returns* a function,
that you can then apply to old (or new) data; see below

    MS> You can use ls.str() to look into the function environment:

sorry Marc, but "Yuck !!"

- this  percentrank() only works when you apply it to original x[i] values
- only works for 'val' of length 1
- is a complicated hack

and absolutely unneeded  (see below)

[gives 0.52 in my version of R ]

Well, that is *THE SAME*  as using  ecdf() the way you 
should have used it :

  ecdf(x)(0.48742905)

{in two lines, that is

  mypercR <- ecdf(x)
  mypercR(0.48742905)

 which maybe easier to understand, if you have never used the
 nice concept that underlies all of

 approxfun(), splinefun() or ecdf()
}

You can also use

  ecdf(x)(x)

and indeed check that it is identical to the convoluted
percentrank() function above :

> ecdf(x)(0.48742905)
[1] 0.52

Actually, it is one (sort of), but it is broken. The instructions say
that you can use R CMD INSTALL to install in R < 2.0.0 (!) With a
current R, you can try but it dies:

No man pages found in package 'nls2'
** building package indices ...

Message-ID: <E2978D5F-BED0-44A7-9196-E5A9E074BB96@gmail.com>

hello,

I have this simple question. This is my dataset

I plot it with:

plot(generalstats[,1], type="b", xlab="Mesi", ylab="Numero di

and try to interpolate with a linear regression with

abline(lm(generalstats[,

lty=3, col="red");

how to interpolate the data with a logistic curve? I cannot find the -  
I suppose easy - solution..

thank you,
Simone

In other words, it is 'not really' a package!  You can install it 
following the instructions it contains, into the current workspace.

I think that's Symbian with a 'y'.

The toolchain availability tends to get in the way. Linux-based gadgets
could prove easier. I do wonder from time to time whether there really
is a market for R on cellphones...

Martin,

Thanks for the corrections. In hindsight, now seeing the intended use of
ecdf() in the fashion you describe above, it is now clear that my
approach in response to David's query was un-needed and "over the top".
"Yuck" is quite appropriate... :-)

As I was going through this "exercise", it did seem overly complicated,
given R's usual elegant philosophy about such things. I suppose if I had
looked at the source for plot.stepfun(), it would have been more evident
as to how the y values are acquired.

In reviewing the examples in ?ecdf, I think that an example using
something along the lines of the discussion here more explicitly, would
be helpful. It is not crystal clear from the examples, that one can use
ecdf() in this fashion, though the use of "12 * Fn(tt)" hints at it.

Perhaps:

##-- Simple didactical  ecdf  example:
x <- rnorm(12)
Fn <- ecdf(x)
Fn
Fn(x)  # returns the percentiles for x
...


Thanks again Martin and no offense taken...  :-)

Regards,

Marc

Only somewhat. The Opteron actually has 1GB too (Hey, it was bought in
2004!  And the main point was to see whether 64 bit builds would work at

It's not like the 64 bit build feels slow for basic usage, though. I
don't think you need to bother with mixing architectures unless you have
applications where it really matters (CPU intensive, but below 32-bit
addressing limitations). Buying more RAM is much to be preferred.

Now what kind of RAM does my Opteron board take... ?

  As soon as someone writes library(ringtone) there might be :)

  And I think you'd have to turn off predictive text. Can someone with a 
mobile/cellphone tell me what 'hist(runif(100))' comes up as? [1]

  I may be mistaken, but I think the values are indeed exported
as double precision -- the issue here is just a display setting.

I've always used rpms (or debs for Debian-type OSes) but I install R
from source which is very easy to do.  Adding R packages with
install.packages() is also extremely easy.  If you have the 64bit OS,
it will compile R as 64 bit (enless you make some modifications to the
standard configuration).

One downside of that is that you'd be unable to use packages that have
only 32 bit versions.  One such is ASReml-R but if you never intend to
use such things, the only other consideration I can think of is the
relatively small amount of memory.  No great benefits of 64 bit
without lots of memory, but a few downsides.

Subject: [R] Working with "ts" objects
Message-ID: <001b01c83775$4ef6fd50$ece4f7f0$@edu>

I am relatively new to R and object oriented programming. I have relied on
SAS for most of my data analysis.  I teach an introductory undergraduate
forecasting course using the Diebold text and I am considering using R in
addition to SAS and Eviews in the course. I work primarily with univariate
or multivariate time series data. I am having a great deal of difficulty
understanding and working with "ts" objects particularly when it comes to
referencing variables in plot commands or in formulas. The confusion is
amplified when certain procedures (lm for example) coerce the "ts" object
into a data.frame before application with the results that the output is
stored in a data.frame object. 
For example the two sets of code below replicate examples from chapter 2 and
6 in the text. In the first set of code if I were to replace
"anscombe<-read.table(fname, header=TRUE)" with
"anscombe<-ts(read.table(fname, header=TRUE))" the plot() commands would
generate errors. The objects "x1", "y1" ...  would not be recognized. In
this case I would have to reference the specific column in the anscombe data
set. If I would have constructed the data set from several different data
sets using the ts.intersect() function (see second code below)the problem
becomes even more involved and keeping track of which columns are associated
with which variables can be rather daunting. All I wanted was to plot actual
vs. predicted values of "hstarts" and the residuals from the model. 

Given the difficulties I have encountered I know my students will have
similar problems. Is there a source other than the basic R manuals that I
can consult and recommend to my students that will help get a handle on
working with time series objects? I found the Shumway "Time series analysis
and its applications with R Examples" website very helpful but many
practical questions involving manipulation of time series data still remain.
Any help will be appreciated.

Subject: [R] Interpretation of 'Intercept' in a 2-way factorial lm
Message-ID: <20071205203143.p8xlokf00s4sk48o@webmail5.uu.se>

Hi all,

I hope this question is not too trivial. I can't find an explanation
anywhere (Stats and R books, R-archives) so now I have to turn to the R-list.

Question:

If you have a factorial design with two factors (say A and B with two
levels each). What does the intercept coefficient with
treatment.contrasts represent??

Here is an example without interaction where A has two levels A1 and
A2, and B has two levels B1 and B2. So R takes as a baseline A1 and B1.

coef( summary ( lm ( fruit ~ A + B, data = test)))

                Estimate   Std. Error  t value       Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept)   2.716667   0.5484828   4.953058   7.879890e-04
A2            6.266667   0.6333333   9.894737   3.907437e-06
B2            5.166667   0.6333333   8.157895   1.892846e-05

I understand that the mean of A2 is +6.3 more than A1, and
that B2 is 5.2 more than B1.

So the question is: Is the intercept A1 and B1 combined as one mean
("the baseline")? or is it something else? Does this number actually
tell me anything
useful (2.716)??

What does the model (y = intercept  + ??) look like then? I can't understand
how both factors (A and B) can have the same intercept?

Thanks in advance!!

I have a very old cellphone whose display, when I switch it on,
looks very much like what one would expect from 'hist(runif(100))'.

I'm not using it any more.

I don't think I know enough to volunteer (but I am open to suggestion  
off list), but I had no difficulty installing R from source on a 64  
bit Ubuntu machine (7.10, with, I believe, 1 GB of RAM) following the  
instructions in R-admin. I just kept installing necessary libraries  
until ./configure completed without errors. Then make, make check,  
and make install ran without a hitch.

Subject: [R]  Displaying numerics to full double precision
Message-ID: <14175334.post@talk.nabble.com>


I'm working on a shared library of C functions for use with R, and I want to
create a matrix in R and pass it to the C routines.  I know R computes and
supposedly stores numerics in double precision, but when I create a matrix
of random numerics using rnorm(), the values are displayed in single
precision, and also exported in single precision when I pass them out to my
C routines.  An example is below:

> a <- matrix(rnorm(16, mean=10, sd=4), nrow=4)
> a
          [,1]      [,2]      [,3]      [,4]

[4,] 14.617647  5.577073  8.217559 12.115465
> storage.mode(a)
[1] "double"

Does anyone know if there is a way to change the display or storage settings
so that the values will be displayed to their full precision?   Or does
rnorm only produce values to single precision? 

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Consider an AxB crosstable of (fitted) means. Upper left corner is
intercept , add A2, B2, or both to get the other three cells.

I am not sure to understand your problem, but it seems to me that you 
can use directly the function on the range of the dates:

 > x=as.Date(c('2007-01-01','2007-01-02'))
 > fff=function(x){y=x+1;return(y)}
 > fff(x)
[1] "2007-01-02" "2007-01-03"
 > class(fff(x))
[1] "Date"

Perhaps your function use a different input (not a vector of dates but a 
dataframe)?

 I'm not sure.
  I do know  that Rinternals.h has

#define REAL(x)         ((double *) DATAPTR(x))

  so that doesn't seem to be the problem ...

Hello,

Subject: [R] Interpretation of 'Intercept' in a 2-way factorial lm
In-Reply-To: <20071205203143.p8xlokf00s4sk48o@webmail5.uu.se>
Message-ID: <200712052102.CIM47190@md2.mail.umd.edu>

You estimate a model with the Factors A or B either present (1) or not
present (0) and with an intercept. Thus you would predict:

For both A and B not present: Intercept
For A only present: Intercept+coef(A)
For B only preseent: Intercept+coef(B)
For both present: Intercept+coef(A)+coef(B).

Again, you would interpret the intercept as the value of "fruit" when A and
B are not present (or inactive). If the intercept is not meaningful in your
setting and you just want to know if both groups differ, then you want to
use function aov I guess. What is your "fruit" variable? I would also
suggest to visually inspect your data. That always helps :) The code is also
down below.

Look at the following example in which 4 x 10 Ys are drawn randomly from
normal distributions with equal variance but different means. The first ten
observations have both A and B not present (i.e. 0) as specified in the
vectors "a" and "b". The mean of these observations where A and B are zero
is 1 as specified in y1=rnorm(10, -> 1 <-,1). As you will see if you run
this code, the estimated Intercept is 1.0512 which is close to 1 (the true
mean). As you see (just confirming what was said above), this is the average
of the baseline (or reference group if you will) when both A and B are
absent.

y1=rnorm(10,1,1)
y2=rnorm(10,2,1)
y3=rnorm(10,3,1)
y4=rnorm(10,4,1)

a=c(rep(0,20),rep(1,20))
b=c(rep(0,10),rep(1,10),rep(0,10),rep(1,10))

y=c(y1,y2,y3,y4)

data=data.frame(cbind(y,a,b))

####Plot####

interaction.plot(a,b,y)

####Models####

summary(lm(y~factor(a)+factor(b),data=data)

####Compare this to####

summary(aov(y~factor(a)+factor(b),data=data)

Cheers,
Daniel

Betreff: [R] Interpretation of 'Intercept' in a 2-way factorial lm

Hi all,

I hope this question is not too trivial. I can't find an explanation
anywhere (Stats and R books, R-archives) so now I have to turn to the
R-list.

Question:

If you have a factorial design with two factors (say A and B with two levels
each). What does the intercept coefficient with treatment.contrasts
represent??

Here is an example without interaction where A has two levels A1 and A2, and
B has two levels B1 and B2. So R takes as a baseline A1 and B1.

coef( summary ( lm ( fruit ~ A + B, data = test)))

                Estimate   Std. Error  t value       Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept)   2.716667   0.5484828   4.953058   7.879890e-04
A2            6.266667   0.6333333   9.894737   3.907437e-06
B2            5.166667   0.6333333   8.157895   1.892846e-05

I understand that the mean of A2 is +6.3 more than A1, and that B2 is 5.2
more than B1.

So the question is: Is the intercept A1 and B1 combined as one mean ("the
baseline")? or is it something else? Does this number actually tell me
anything useful (2.716)??

What does the model (y = intercept  + ??) look like then? I can't understand
how both factors (A and B) can have the same intercept?

Thanks in advance!!

As far as I know (beware, I'm a novice), internally R stores to and
uses full precision. The display of the data, however, is controlled
by "digits". You'd need to put, say, options(digits=7) in your
Rprofile.site (if it doesn't exist, creat it in the R etc/ folder).
You might also be interested by "scipen". Check ?options.

Liviu

Message-ID: <2b2890520712051405h55b2f45fs2374265c661c9a75@mail.gmail.com>

I'm wanting to run R scripts non-interactively as part of a
"technology independent" framework.
I want control over the behaviour of these processes by specifying
various global variables in a "configuration file" that would be
passed as a command line argument.

I'm wondering if you know of any R support for configuration file
formats. (i.e. any functions that would read a configuration file of
some common format)

For example:
-The .properties configuration format for java seems to be quite
popular, would I have to read it in by writing some kind of java
extension to R?
-An XML configuration format could also be possible, but it's overkill
for my needs.

Any help would be greatly appreciated

You might want to consider using the hdf5 package to save the array in 
HDF5 format. There are HDF5 libraries for Java as well 
<http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/hdf-java-html/>. I have never used them, but 
it works quite well for transferring data between R and Python.

I can imagine it is indeed. I use the source of packages functions  
very often.

Thanks very much. I'll test this soon (and it looks like the vector  
operation might even be directly translatable in Fortran which is  
nice since I'll need to do it in Fortran too).

Thanks again.

Subject: [R] Junk or not Junk ???

Message-ID: <C37C7167.156AD%engrav@u.washington.edu>

Thank you

As per advice from several R users I have set

r-project.org, stat.math.ethz.ch,fhcrc.org, stat.ethz.ch, math.ethz.ch,
hypatia.math.ethz.ch

 all to be "safe domains"

But still some R emails go to Junk and require to be found manually

I have explored the issue with Univ Wash computing to no avail

Is this just how it is or have I still missed the "fix" to keep R emails out
of junk?

Thank you

Thank you for this reminder|tip ! I didn't re-read this document since
... oh, my  ... very early (1.x ?) versions. At which time my favorite
peeve against R was the fixed memory allocation scheme.

I would have thought that 64 bits machines could take advantage of a
wider bus and (marginally ?) faster instructions to balance larger
pointers. Am I mistaken ?

Thank again !

Subject: [R] nearest correlation to polychoric
In-Reply-To: <20070713184214.82160@gmx.net>
Message-ID: <6bpm1d$503of7@toip4.srvr.bell.ca>

Dear Jens,

I've submitted a new version (0.7-4) of the polycor package to CRAN. The
hetcor() function now uses your nearcor() in sfsmisc to make the returned
correlation matrix positive-definite if it is not already.

I know that quite some time has elapsed since you raised this issue, and I
apologize for taking so long to deal with it. (I've also kept track of your
suggestions for the sem package, and will respond to them when I next make
substantial modifications to the package -- though not in the near future.)

Thank you,
 John

Hmm, could be. They got rebuilt on my system and committted at some 
point in the 2.6.1 run-in. and that system has 1.5.0. I did check that 
things still worked, but I didn't think the version would matter. The 
actual Java code is unchanged, so you could copy the .class files over 
from 2.6.0 (& let us know if it works)

Excellent!  That worked.  Thanks, Peter.
If this is going to be a continuing issue for future versions, would the best 
advice be to upgrade JVM anyway, at least to 1.5.0?

Message-ID: <14185060.post@talk.nabble.com>


Dear friends :
    using the "glm" function and setting family=binomial, I got a list of
coefficients.
The coefficients reflect the effects  of predicted variables on the
probability of the response to be "1".
My response variable consists of  "A" and "D" . I don't know which level of
the response was set to be 1.
is the first element of the response set to be 1?
   Thank all in advance.

Message-ID: <55B194DA-5A84-4BCD-8869-C55D47FDB695@virginia.edu>

Dear r-helpers,

How do I tell xYplot() and Key() that I want the labels in italic?

I tried this:

pdf(file = "khw.pdf", width = 8, height = 8)
with(subset(khw, length < 1.6), xYplot(lo ~ length|sub, groups = v,
aspect="xy", pch = c(1, 2, 16), col = c(2, 4, 9),
xlab=expression(frac(abs(bolditalic(v) ), abs(bolditalic(a)))),
ylab = grid::textGrob(expression(paste(log, ~~frac(italic(p) 
(italic(v)), italic(p)(italic(a))))) ),
panel=function(x,y,...){
	panel.xYplot(x, y, ...)
	panel.lmline(x, y, type = "l")
	}))
Key(x = 0.667, y = 0.833, other = list(title = expression(italic(v)),  
cex.title = 1,
	labels = c(expression(italic(b)), expression(italic(c)),  
expression(italic(d)))))
dev.off()

This works only for the title.

As per the Details section of ?glm:

For binomial and quasibinomial families the response can also be
specified as a factor (when the first level denotes failure and all
others success) ...


So use:

  levels(response.variable)

and that will give you the factor levels, where the first level is 0 and
the second level is 1. 

If you work in a typical English based locale with default alpha based
level ordering, it will likely be A (Alive?) is 0 and D (Dead?) is 1.

HTH,

Marc Schwartz

Dear Marc Schwartz:
 When I ask R2.6.0 for windows, the information it gives does not contain
much about family=binomial .
 You said that there is a detail section of "?glm". I want to read it
thoroughly. Could  you tell me where and how I can find the detail section
of "?glm".
   Thank you very much .
   Best regards,
 Bin Yue

Is the rmpi package (or rpvm) needed to exploit multiple cores on a

does not provide info about setting up a single machine with multiple
cores. Also, if how effective is it to run a bayesian simulation on
parallel (or distributed) processors using the snow package.

anscombe is built into R already so you don't need to read it in.
An intercept is the default in lm so you don't have to specify it.

opar <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(y1 ~ x1, anscombe)
reg <- lm(y1 ~ x1, anscombe)
reg
abline(reg)
...etc...
par(opar)

Note that plot(anscombe[1:2]) and lm(anscombe[2:1]) also work.

read.table returns a data frame whereas ts requires a vector
or matrix so none of your ts code will work.  as.matrix(DF)
or data.matrix(DF) will convert data frame DF to a matrix.

 Dear all:
     By comparing glmresult$y and model.response(model.frame(glmresult)),  I
have found out which one is 
set to be "TRUE" and which "FALSE".But it seems that to fit a logistic
regression , logit (or logistic) transformation has to be done before
regression.
     Does anybody know how to obtain the transformation result ? It is hard
to settle down before knowing the actual process R works . I have read some
books and the "?glm" help file , but what they told me was not sufficient.
   Best wishes ,
 Bin Yue

Yes, it is more complex than that.  If you run 32-bit instructions on a 
x86_64, the physical bus is the same as when you run 64-bit instructions. 
The larger code usually means the CPU caches spill more often, and some 
64-bit chips have more 32-bit than 64-bit registers which allows better 
scheduling.

The R-admin manual reports on some empirical testing.  But when you have 
limited RAM the larger code and data for a 64-bit build will cause more 
swapping and that is likely to dominate performance issues on large 
problems.

Note that the comparisons depend on both the chip and the OS: it seems 
that on Mac OS 10.5 on a Core 2 Duo the 64-bit version is faster (on small 
examples).  The original enquiry was about 'amd64 linux', but I've checked 
Intel Core 2 Duo as well: on my box 64-bit builds are faster than 32-bit 
ones, whereas the reverse is true for Opterons.  So it seems that the 
architectural differences of Core 2 Duo vs AMD64 do affect the issue.

-----------
The Key function generated by some plot commands should have a ... parameter.
Otherwise, the ... in rlegend is useless, and it would be nice to be able to
suppress the box, for example.

Key = function (x = NULL, y = NULL, lev = c("No Fail", "Fail"), pch = c(16, 1))
{ .. part omitted

    rlegend(x, y, legend = lev, pch = pch, ...) invisible()

}

Dear Simone,

you can use the package 'drc' to fit a logistic model, that is a non-linear regression 
model based on the equation c+(d-c)/(1+exp(b(x-e))), to your data (below named 'simone'):


## Fitting a 4-parameter logistic model (also called Boltzmann model)
simone.m1 <- drm(size~x, data=simone, fct=B.4())

## Plotting the data together with the fitted curve
plot(simone.m1, log="")


The fit is not great due to the bend.

Subject: [R] Using panel.densityplot with stripplot
Message-ID: <op.t2wl071ymknj4h@thimphu.pcpool.mi.fu-berlin.de>

Hi Lattice-Experts/Hi Deepayan,
   I have been searching the archives for an answer to this, but am finally  
giving up:

I am plotting stripplots above each other using

stripplot(type ~ date, data = email)

which looks exactely as I want (type is a factor with 8 levels). I  
addition I would now like to display for each stripplot a density curve.

 From examples I would have thought I would need to do:

stripplot(type ~ date2, data = email,
           panel = function(x, y, ...) {
             panel.stripplot(x, y, ...)
             panel.densityplot(x, y, ...)
           })

This works as far as the stripplot part is concerned. But

a.) panel.densityplot does not take a y argument.

b.) even if I drop y, no density curve shows up (I guess I am missing  
correct dargs here)

I have been toying with

- using panel.superpose but guess that this is not the right approach,  
since I do not have a grouping variable (and I have not succeeded in  
letting "~ date2 | type" and "~date, groups=email$type" look the way I  
want).

- using densityplot instead of stripplot, but then panel.stripplot  
complains that argument y is missing. :-(

Many thanks for any advice/ideas!
   Christopher

What examples? panel.stripplot and panel.densityplot have entirely
different expectations about what the y-range of the panel is going to
be, and they cannot be mixed.

Sounds like you want something like panel.violin (?panel.violin has an example).

Subject: [R] R CMD Build feature searches or requests
Message-ID: <fj8dbj$950$1@ger.gmane.org>

Hello,

I'm missing two features in "R CMD build":
1) Easy building of Windows/zip packaged package version alongside the
*nix-style *.tar.gz.
Right now I'm doing a scripted version of 
        R CMD build <PACKAGE>
        R CMD INSTALL <PACKAGE>
        mkdir tmp
        cp -r /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/<PACKAGE> tmp/<PACKAGE>
        cd tmp
        zip -r <PACKAGE>_<EXTRACTEDVERSION>.zip <PACKAGE> 
        mv *.zip ..
        cd ..
        rm -rf tmp
I was wondering whether it wouldn't be helpfull to others maintaining
packages not requiring genuine cross-compilation (only containing R code)
to deal with this via an option to "R CMD build". Something
like '-zip-package' might do it ...
2) My scripted solution right now also automatically increments version
numbers and adjusts dates in <PACKAGE>/man/<PACKAGE>-package.Rd and
<PACKAGE>/DESCRIPTION, ensuring progressing and continuous package naming.
Would be nice to have an "R CMD build"-option to take care of that too ...

Please let me know what you think or where to find the functionality in case
I overlooked it.

Thanks, Joh

Hi Dieter,

I actually solved *my* problem:

Key(x = 0.667, y = 0.833, lev = c(expression(italic(b)),  
expression(italic(c)), expression(italic(d))),
	other = list(title = expression(italic(v)), cex.title = 1))

I was able to figure this out only by looking at the code for Key(),  
because I hadn't come across the 'lev' argument in the documentation  
(in fact Key does not appear in the list of functions of Hmisc; I  
discovered its usefulness by consulting the examples for xYplot()). I  
would have expected this argument to be called 'labels' (see  
help(labels)), (or at least 'levels'):

function (x = NULL, y = NULL, lev = c("b", "c", "d"), cex = c(0.7,  
0.7, 0.7), col = c(2, 4, 9), font = c(1, 1, 1), pch = c(1, 2, 16),  
other = NULL)
{
?
}
?

Note that the NULL setting of the parameter may be useful for  
programming, but it is not useful to anyone reading the code. How is  
one to proceed after having read help(NULL)?

At the same time, I have no grounds for complaining about the  
documentation for Key(): Frank Harrell is giving away his work. His  
examples are extensive, and his functions always work as advertised.  
Sometimes they also work as not advertised.

This is one of the cases where I wish there were a function that  
"exercised" all the arguments of a graphics function by visualizing  
the effect of changing  two or three levels of each argument (one by  
one, of course). This might have the side effect of allowing authors  
to shorten documentation. I have in mind adding a method to each  
graphics function, and having the author specify the two or three  
instructive levels of each argument. See the exhaustive exploration by  
J.R. Lobry, A.B. Dufour & D. Chessel of the graphical parameters  
accessible by par(), at
http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/R/fichestd/tdr75.pdf

Hi Deepayan!
   thank you! panel.violin with the following modification works as I want:

grid.polyline(x = dx.list[[i]], y = dy.list[[i]], ...

instead of

grid.polygon(x = c(dx.list[[i]], rev(dx.list[[i]])),
                 y = c(dy.list[[i]], -rev(dy.list[[i]])), ...

>>  From examples I would have thought I would need to do...

The examples for writing your own panel functions. I was not aware that  
there were different expectations regarding arguments.

> panel.stripplot and panel.densityplot have entirely
> different expectations about what the y-range of the panel is going to
> be, and they cannot be mixed.

But is there a technical reason for making this distinction? It seemed to  
me that most panel functions can deal with x and y parameters and that  
panel.densityplot could make use of the same mechanisms as panel.violin to  
subdivide based on factor y.

Again many thanks for the fast response,
   Christopher

Dear all

I tried to make a biplot with color coded labels but I was not successful. 
Searching archives I found that it is probably not so simple.
I found
http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/help/05/01/10661.html

which recommends eqscplot

eqscplot(fit$score[,1], fit$score[,2], pch = 20, col=c(rep(2,10), 
rep(3,40)), cex=2)

http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/help/05/01/10661.html

or I can use plot itself, but then I was not able to find how to add 
arrows.

The closest I get is

fit<-(princomp(USArrests, cor = TRUE))
biplot(fit , xlabs=rep("", 50))
points(fit$score[,1], fit$score[,2], pch = 20, col=c(rep(2,10), 
rep(3,40)), cex=2)

and use some suitable scaling before calling points. 

My question is if there is some other easier approach to get color coded 
points in biplot?

Dear Brendan,
I am not sure to understand your code..

It seems to me that your are interested in fitting a one-breakpoint 
segmented relationship in each level of your grouping variable

If this is the case, the correct code is below.
In order to fit a segmented relationship in each group you have to 
define the relevant variable before fitting, and to constrain the last 
slope to be zero you have to consider the `minus' variable..(I discuss 
these points in the submitted Rnews article..If you are interested, let 
me know off list).

If my code does not fix your problem, please let me know,

Best,
vito

##--define the group-specific segmented variable:
X<-model.matrix(~0+factor(group),data=df)*df$tt
df$tt.KV<-X[,1] #KV
df$tt.KW<-X[,2]   #KW
df$tt.WC<-X[,3]   #WC

##-fit the unconstrained model
olm<-lm(y~group+tt.KV+tt.KW+tt.WC,data=df)
os<-segmented(olm,seg.Z=~tt.KV+tt.KW+tt.WC,psi=list(tt.KV=350, 
tt.KW=500, tt.WC=350))
#have a look to results:
with(df,plot(tt,y))
with(subset(df,group=="RKW"),points(tt,y,col=2))
with(subset(df,group=="RKV"),points(tt,y,col=3))
points(df$tt[df$group=="RWC"],fitted(os)[df$group=="RWC"],pch=20)
points(df$tt[df$group=="RKW"],fitted(os)[df$group=="RKW"],pch=20,col=2)
points(df$tt[df$group=="RKV"],fitted(os)[df$group=="RKV"],pch=20,col=3)


#constrain the last slope in group KW
tt.KW.minus<- -df$tt.KW
olm1<-lm(y~group+tt.KV+tt.WC,data=df)
os1<-segmented(olm1,seg.Z=~tt.KV+tt.KW.minus+tt.WC,psi=list(tt.KV=350, 
tt.KW.minus=-500, tt.WC=350))
#check..:-)
slope(os1)

with(df,plot(tt,y))
with(subset(df,group=="RKW"),points(tt,y,col=2))
with(subset(df,group=="RKV"),points(tt,y,col=3))
points(df$tt[df$group=="RWC"],fitted(os1)[df$group=="RWC"],pch=20)
points(df$tt[df$group=="RKW"],fitted(os1)[df$group=="RKW"],pch=20,col=2)
points(df$tt[df$group=="RKV"],fitted(os1)[df$group=="RKV"],pch=20,col=3)

Subject: [R] Building package - tab delimited example data issue
Message-ID: <fj8i94$q54$1@ger.gmane.org>

Hello,

I'm trying to integrate example data in the shape of a tab delimited ASCII
file into my package and therefore dropped it into the data subdirectory.
The build works out just fine, but when I attempt to install I get:

** building package indices ...
Error in scan(file, what, nmax, sep, dec, quote, skip, nlines,
na.strings,  :
  line 1 did not have 500 elements
Calls: <Anonymous> ... <Anonymous> -> switch -> assign -> read.table -> scan
Execution halted
ERROR: installing package indices failed
** Removing '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/MaxQuantUtils'
** Restoring previous '/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/MaxQuantUtils'

Accordingly the check delivers:

...
* checking whether package 'MaxQuantUtils' can be installed ... ERROR

Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong? build/install witout the ASCII file
works just fine.

Joh

Faisal,

can you elaborate further on your conjoint design....

there is bayesm which offers a hierarchical bayes approach to analysing 
choice data

MLogit available through zelig (see below)

http://gking.harvard.edu/zelig/docs/index.html

MNP as a standalone package for the probit model

thanks Paul

If you had looked at help(data), you would have found a list of which
file formats it supports and how they are read. Hint: TAB-delimited
files are not among them. *Whitespace* separated files work, using
read.table(filename, header=TRUE), but that is not a superset of
TAB-delimited data if there are empty fields.

A nice trick is to figure out how to read the data from the command line
and drop the relevant code into a mydata.R file (assuming that the
actual data file is mydata.txt). This gets executed when the data is
loaded (by data(mydata) or when building the lazyload database) because
.R files have priority over .txt.

This is quite general and allows a nice way of incorporating data
management while retaining the original data source:

>more ISwR/data/stroke.R

stroke <-  read.csv2("stroke.csv", na.strings=".")
names(stroke) <- tolower(names(stroke))
stroke <-  within(stroke,{
    sex <- factor(sex,levels=0:1,labels=c("Female","Male"))
    dgn <- factor(dgn)
    coma <- factor(coma, levels=0:1, labels=c("No","Yes"))
    minf <- factor(minf, levels=0:1, labels=c("No","Yes"))
    diab <- factor(diab, levels=0:1, labels=c("No","Yes"))
    han <- factor(han, levels=0:1, labels=c("No","Yes"))

    dead <- !is.na(died) & died < as.Date("1996-01-01")
    died[!dead] <- NA

Thank you, Marc for the above proposal, to make the examples

I've now amended the R-devel version of  help(ecdf) accordingly.

I'm glad. You're welcome!

On the other hand, "Writing R Extensions" has stated since a long time
(and still does):

The @file{data} subdirectory is for additional data files the package
makes available for loading using @code{data()}.  Currently, data files
can have one of three types as indicated by their extension: plain R
code (@file{.R} or @file{.r}), tables (@file{.tab}, @file{.txt}, or
@file{.csv}), or @code{save()} images (@file{.RData} or @file{.rda}).

Now in my book, .csv files contain comma separated values, .tab files
contain values separated by TABs and .txt files are "pure" text files,
presumably values separated by any kind of white space. 

Thus, I think that the expectation that TAB-delimited file formats
should work is not unreasonable; I was long time ago bitten by this
too. Then I realised that the phrase "one of the three types" should
probably be interpreted as implying that .tab, .txt and .csv files are
all of the same type and, apparently, should contain values separated
by whitespace.  I admit that I never tested whether .csv files would
lead to the same problems as TAB delimited .tab files. Rather, I decided
in the end that the safest option, i.e. to avoid misleading file
extensions, would be to use .rda files in the future.

Cheers,

If you are using correspondence analysis you could see the plot.ca 
function in the ca library.

Dear Christian,

it works great, and it is simple to understand, thank you very much.

just a detail, is it possible to plot just the fitted curve and not  
the data? it's because I would like to have data in black and the  
fitted curve in red.. I don't know how to pick up the single parts, if  
I simply wrote

> plot(simone.m1, log="", col="red")

everything became red..

thank in advance,
Simone

Thanks for your help. Very insightfull and your version of "RTFM" was not to 
harsh either ;0)
Part of what I want to achieve with the inclusion of the file is to be able to 
showcase a read-in function for the particular data type. Is there a slick 
way - sticking to your example - to reference the 'stroke.csv' directly?
I'd like to put in the example of some function.Rd something analogous to
	# Use function to read in file:
	result <- function(<link to 'stroke.csv' in installed ISwR package>)
Without having to resort to accepting the example as "No Run".

Thanks for your help, Joh

Subject: [R] $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors,
	returning NULL - what is the right thing to do then?
Message-ID: <C83C5E3DEEE97E498B74729A33F6EAEC0562F999@DJFPOST01.djf.agrsci.dk>

Dear all,
Starting from a recent version of R, the $ became "unusable" on atomic vectors, e.g.
> x <- c(a=1,b=2)
> x$a
NULL
Warning message:
In x$a : $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors, returning NULL
 
I can of course do
> x['a']
- but that requires more typing (5 characters rather than 2). 
 
Apologies if I've missed a an announcement regarding this, but
1) Is there an alternative to the ['a'] and
2) Why was this change made?
 
Regards
S?ren

Subject: [R] Nine questions about methods and generics
Message-ID: <Zen-1J0Fg4-0005As-ON@heisenberg.zen.co.uk>

I have a series of question about methods and generics.
The questions are interspersed in some text which explains
what I want to do, how it works now and why I do not
understand well why it works. Questions are written
Q1 and so on up to Q9 and always start a new line.

The concrete problem is this: it has become customary
after a meta-analysis to quote various statistics
to give a picture of the degree of heterogeneity.
Initially I wrote a function which calculated these given
the heterogeneity chi-squared Q and the number of studies k.
It then occurred to me that it would be convenient to
have functions which take the objects returned by
the various functions in the package rmeta (available
from CRAN) and perform the calculation on them.
So after plagiarising some ideas from rmeta
I wrote

hetero <- function(x, ...) {
    UseMethod("hetero")
}

Q1 - have I created a generic called hetero? If so
what is the correct idiom: created, declared, ...?
Q2 - if I go class(hetero) it returns "function" rather
than "generic". Is that what I should expect?

I then called my original function hetero.default

hetero.default <- function(Q = NULL, k = NULL, conflevel = 0.95) {
# some code left out here which computes values in the list res
    class(res) <- "meta.hetero"
    res
}

Q3 was it a good idea to have it return an object of class
"meta.hetero" or would it have been better to call it "hetero"

now if I go
hetero(14.4, 24)
I get what I expected

I then provide a new function

hetero.meta.summaries <- function(obj, ...) {
# some code to calculate Q and k
    res <- hetero.default(Q, k, ...)
    res
}
which also seems to do what I wanted. There are also
similar functions hetero.meta.MH and hetero.meta.DSL
to operate on the other classes of object returned in rmeta.

The problem is that I do not really understand why it all works
and suspect it could easily stop working.

At this point I decided that if all else fails I should read the
documentation. The manual pages (the things you get
with ?UseMethod) describe what the functions do but
do not give me a series of steps to salvation.
I found S Programming (V&R) much clearer now I knew where to
look but I think V&R underestimate the depths of my
ignorance.

Q4 V&R seems to suggest that I should have called the first
argument to hetero, hetero.default and hetero.meta.summaries
the same (possibly x or object) yet it seems to work.
Q5 Does it matter?
If it does matter which should I choose?

I also decide to look at R-extensions which seems
to suggest that I should be using NextMethod and
also has dire warnings about having different argument
lists to the various methods.
I found R-extensions much the least helpful
of the three sources I tried.

Q6 should I be using NextMethod?
Q7 if what I have created are methods which are
displayed by methods("hetero") why is it UseMethod not
usemethod? (I note that ?Methods tells me about something
different from ?methods.)
Q8 I have used a ... argument for hetero.meta.summaries
but not for hetero.default. Was that wise? R-extensions
has some stern things to say here which I do not really
understand.
Q9 is there somewhere else I could have looked
bearing in mind my comments above about the
manual pages, V&R and R-extensions? Or shall
I just keep reading V&R until the penny drops?

For the record:

S Programming (V&R) means
@BOOK{venables00,
   author = {Venables, W N and Ripley, B D},
   year = 2000,
   title = {S programming},
   publisher = {Springer-Verlag},
   address = {New York},
   keywords = {statistics general; software}
}
The heterogeneity statistics are explained in
@ARTICLE{higgins02,
   author = {Higgins, J P T and Thompson, S G},
   year = 2002,
   title = {Quantifying heterogeneity in a meta--analysis},
   journal = {Statistics in Medicine},
   volume = 21,
   pages = {1539--1558},
   keywords = {meta-analysis, heterogeneity}
}

I am using 2.6.1 under XP Professional.
My knowledge of computer science is frozen at about 1975.

It has always returned NULL on atomic vectors: see the help page.
E.g. in R 2.0.0 from 2004:

> x <- c(a=1,b=2)
> x$a
NULL
> x['a']
a
1

The warning was added three versions of R ago: the announcement is in the 
NEWS file for 2.5.0.

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

     o   Using $ on an atomic vector now raises a warning, as does use
         on an S4 class for which a method has not been defined.

I think you have exemplified the answer to your question '2)': because 
users misunderstood what it did.

In R 2.7.0 this will be an error, since package programmers did not seem 
to be heeding the warnings.

While Brian has answered your query from a more technical
point of view, there's an implication you should consider.

x$a always (as far as I know)[*] has been "unusable", in that
it returns NULL, and not what you expected to get. The only
thing that's (relatively) new is that you now get a warning.

[*] Certainly as early as R-1.6.2 (Jan 2003), as I've just checked.

Previously, you were not getting a warning.

So, if you were using the likes of x$a in code, and getting
no warnings, possibly your code was generating results
derived from NULL values rather than from the values you
expected it to be using. Perhaps you should check back!

Best wishes,
Ted.

Since the above does not actually reproduce percentrank in the case
of ties, the change that would facilitate this particularly would be to add
a ties = "excelpercentrank" to approx.  See my solution earlier in this
thread.

Now had you lived in the Western world ... (Hey, what's that? New
address!) ... then you would have known better than to have any trust in
file extensions. At the time "they" apparently figured that the .CSV
standard was so good that it was even better to have two of them (double
standards are twice as good, right?), depending on whether you were in
England or in Denmark, I lost faith completely. (In this country you can
export to a text file with SAS and then NOT read it with SPSS and vice
versa on the same Windows machine).

Actually, R is a bit perverse about .csv too since it expects
_semicolon_  field separator, but not the  comma decimal separator which
usually accompanies it. The reason for this is lost in the mists of time
-- the datasets in current versions of R do not include any .csv files.
There are, however, six .tab files, three of which are not
tab-separated, but I don't actually think there was ever a standard to
the effect that they should be (.tab just means that it is a _table_).

So, you really need to read the help page for data, which does have the 
exact info. The passage you cite from the manual could do with a
rephrasing, although it probably isn't technically incorrect. As it
stands, it reminds me a bit of the old Monty Python sketch:

"Our *three* weapons are fear, surprise, and ruthless efficiency...and
an almost fanatical devotion to the Pope.... Our *four*...no...
*Amongst* our weapons.... Amongst our weaponry...are such elements as
fear, surprise.... I'll come in again"

(There really are 3 data TYPES, but 4 FORMATS and, er, diverse EXTENSIONS)

Subject: [R] differences in using source() or console
Message-ID: <4757F2A9.8040300@dssm.unipa.it>

Dear all,
Is there *any* reason explaining what I describe below?
I have the following line

myfun(x)

If I type them directly in R (or copy/past), it works..

However if I type in R 2.6.1

 > source("code.R") ##code.R includes the above line
Error in inherits(x, "data.frame") : object "d" not found

namely myfun() does not work correctly.
In particular the non-working line inside myfun() is

update(eval(x$call$obj), data=d) #d is created in myfun()

My question is: why the problem occurs just via source()ing???

many thanks,
vito

Message-ID: <14193218.post@talk.nabble.com>


Dear list,
i have this problem:
how to pair a graphic.png and a table in R2HTML ?

The better showing of a mutiple analysis is sometimes to mate graphic and
table

Can anyone help me in this task ??

In the example below graphisc and table are subsequent and not pair..
 

directory=getwd()
myfile<-file.path(directory,"testHTML.html")    
HTMLoutput=file.path(directory,"testHTML.html")
graf="graf.png"
png(file.path(directory,graf))
plot(c(1:12))
dev.off()
tab<-as.matrix(c(1:12))
HTMLInsertGraph(graf,tab,file=HTMLoutput,caption="Esempio di grafico")
browseURL(myfile)

Thanks in advance

Roberto Iacopetti

Hi, All;

I've compiled and installed successfully "presumably" 64-bit R on  
Leopard.
But when I tried to run R, I got the following error:

/usr/bin/R: line 179: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/ 
i386/ldpaths: No such file or directory

Here is the configuration I used:

CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash ../R-devel/configure r_arch=x86_64 LDFLAGS="-L/

Thanks in advance

 From the help page:

Arguments:

        x: numeric matrix of the values to be plotted.

     Rowv: determines if and how the _row_ dendrogram should be
           reordered.  By default, it is TRUE, which implies dendrogram
           is computed and reordered based on row means. If NULL or
           FALSE, then no dendrogram is computed and reordering is done.
           If a 'dendrogram', then it is used "as-is", ie without any
           reordering. If a vector of integers, then dendrogram is
           computed and reordered based on the order of the vector.

Answering to myself and staying with the same example:
        system.file("data/stroke.csv",package="ISwR")
allows direct access to the example file (name).

There's an announcement in the NEWS file for 2.6.0

DEPRECATED & DEFUNCT

     o	$ on an atomic vector now gives a warning that it is 'invalid'.
	It remains deprecated, but may be removed in R >= 2.7.0.

and an update in R-devel saying that in fact it has been made defunct there.

In answer to your questions:

1) I don't think so, other than x[1].
2) I don't remember the details, other than it was to avoid confusion. 
Maybe someone else can summarize the discussion?

You could use a table with one row and two columns:

HTML("<TABLE><TD>",file=HTMLoutput)
HTML(tab,file=HTMLoutput)
HTML("</TD><TD>",file=HTMLoutput)
HTMLInsertGraph(graf,file=HTMLoutput,caption="Esempio di grafico")
HTML("</TD></TABLE>",file=HTMLoutput)

domenico

PS:
You could create a function if this is a common operation:

tableGraph=function(tab2Html,graph2Html,fileHtml){
    HTML("<TABLE><TD>",file=fileHtml)
    HTML(tab2Html,file=HTMLoutput)
    HTML("</TD><TD>",file=HTMLoutput)
    HTMLInsertGraph(graph2Html,file=fileHtml,caption="Esempio di grafico")
    HTML("</TD></TABLE>",file=fileHtml)
}

and then:
tableGraph(tab,graf,HTMLoutput)

Yes, but...

This works right until you turn on LazyData for your package, then you
end up with only

00Index  Rdata.rdb  Rdata.rds  Rdata.rdx

in the data directory. Use the "inst" source subdir for files you want
to have installed explicitly.

Also, in principle, it is

system.file("data", "stroke.csv", package="ISwR")


although platforms that do not understand "/" as the path separator are
rare nowadays.

I suspect most people that stay on this list read most posts through a news
reader... you might consider doing the same. I can't even imagine keeping up
with the daily deluge of individual emails.

Subject: [R] Vertical text in a plot
Message-ID: <5c79da7a0712060716j3bfabdd7v7bad975de9c1b953@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Consider this simple plot:

I want to add an additional axis as

I have no idea how to add now the title of the new axis as "Second
Y-axis label". I want this text to be vertically directed from bottom
to top. I can't find the function in text() to write vertically. Any
ideas?

Thanks,

Hi, All;

I've compiled and installed successfully "presumably" 64-bit R on  
Leopard.
But when I tried to run R, I got the following error:

/usr/bin/R: line 179: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/ 
i386/ldpaths: No such file or directory

Here is the configuration I used:

CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash ../R-devel/configure r_arch=x86_64 LDFLAGS="-L/ 
usr/local/lib64 -L/usr/X11R6/lib" CC='gcc-4.2 -g -O3' CXX='g++-4.2 -g -

Simple workaround is to include the \usepackage{Sweave} in your .Rnw file,
after the \documentclass like this:

\documentclass[a4paper]{article}
\usepackage{Sweave}

Make sure you have all the .sty files you need in the same folder as your
.tex file.

cheers,  Mike

?plot.zoo

starting at:
 ## plot with left and right axes

hi gabor,

i was able to get your suggestion to work.  i have been going through 
the R help tools to figure out what each step actually does because i 
have something similar but hours 2,5,8,11,14,17 and 20 are missing.  i 
haven't had any luck.  each "mean value" that is calculated is the 
same.  i keep getting the following error:

"> DF<- read.table(textConnection(Lines), header = TRUE)
Error in read.table(textConnection(Lines), header = TRUE) :
        duplicate 'row.names' are not allowed
 >   aggregate(DF[2:4],
+    with(DF, data.frame(Year, Qtr = (Month - 3) %/% 3 + 1, Hour)),
+    mean)    #skip=hour[2,5,8,11,14]
Error in data.frame(Year, Qtr = (Month - 3)%/%3 + 1, Hour) :
        object "Year" not found
"

i am not clear why in "aggregate(DF[#:#]" that we are subsetting other 
variables besides co2.  i have been trying to just subset co2 without 
success though.
your original suggestion is below and a snippet of my data set is below 
that. if you have any ideas  or if you know of a help page that i may 
not have found yet that would be great (i've been using the "aggregate" 
help pages mostly.

thanks for your help-

The technical reason is a fundamental part of the Trellis design. The
prepanel function determines a bounding box as part of the initial
calculations. Knowing this in advance allows the panel display and the
axis rendering to be completely separated.

Note that the panel.violin plot cannot easily say anything about the
actual heights of the densities, only their shape. The y-axis there
annotates the sample groups.

Subject: [R] coxme frailty model standard errors?
Message-ID: <200712061658.lB6Gw3F09575@hsrnfs-101.mayo.edu>

--- begin included message
I am running R 2.6.1 on windows xp
I am trying to fit a cox proportional hazard model with a shared
Gaussian frailty term using coxme My model is specified as:

nofit1<-coxme(Surv(Age,cen1new)~ Sex+bo2+bo3,random=~1|isl,data=mydat)

With x1-x3 being dummy variables, and isl being the community level
variable with 4 levels.

Does anyone know if there is a way to get the standard error for the
random effect, like in nofit1$var?  I would like to know if my random
effect is worth writing home about.

-- end included message

  Computation of the se of the random effect turns out to be very hard, and 
worse it isn't worth much when you have done so.  For both these reasons coxme 
doesn't even try (and it's not on the list of things to add).
  
   First, you can do a likelihood ratio test by comparing the fit to a coxph 
model that does not have the random effect.   Make sure that the null 
loglikelihood for the two fits are the same though!  (For instance, one obs was 
missing the "isl" variable above, so the two fits have differnt n).  

     fit1<-  coxme(Surv(Age,cen1new)~ Sex+bo2+bo3,random=~1|isl, data=mydat)  
     fit2<- coxph(Surv(Age,cen1new)~ Sex+bo2+bo3, data=mydat)
     fit1$loglik[1:2] - fit2$loglik	
     
The first number printed should be 0, twice the second is distributed as a chisq 
on "number of random effects" degrees of freedom.  (Not quite.  The chisq test 
is actually conservative since the random effect is constrained to be >=0.  But 
it is close, and I'll let someone else work out the details)

   Second, you can print a profile likelihood confidence interval.  You had a 
random effects variance of about .4, so make a guess that the confidence 
interval is somewhere between 0 and 2.
     vtemp <- seq(0.0001, 2, length=20) 
     ltemp <- 0*vtemp
     for (i in 1:length(vtemp)) {
     	tfit <- coxme(Surv(Age,cen1new)~ Sex+bo2+bo3,random=~1|isl, data=mydat,
     		    variance= vtemp[i])
        ltemp <- 2 * diff(tfit$loglik[1:2])
        }
     plot(vtemp, ltemp, xlab='Variance', ylab="LR test")
     abline(h= 2*diff(fit1$loglik[1:2]) - 3.84)
     
   The sequence of fits each have a fixed value for the variance of the random 
effect; the plot shows the profile likelihood.  The profile is often very 
asymmetric (which is why the se of the random effect isn't worth much).  The 
intersection of the profile with a line 3.84 units down (chisq on 1df) is the 
profile based 95% confidence interval.

Subject: [R]  Help rewriting looping structure?
Message-ID: <14196412.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hey Folks,

Could somebody help me rewrite the following code?

I am looping through all records across 5 fields to calculate the cumulative
percentage of each record (relative to each individual field).

Is there a way to rewrite it so I don't have to loop through each individual
record?

##### tdat is my data frame
##### j is my field index
##### k is my record index
##### tsum is the sum of all values in field j
##### tmp is a vector containing the values in field j
##### tdat[k,paste("cpct,j,sep="")] creates new fields "cpct1",...,"cpct5" 


for(j in 1:5) {
  tsum<- sum(tdat[,j]);
  for(k in 1:nrow(tdat)) {
    td<- tdat[k,j];
    tmp<-tdat[,j];
##### sum values <= to current value and divide by the total sum
    tdat[k,paste("cpct,j,sep="")]<- sum(tmp[tmp <= td]) / tsum;
  }
}


Thanks,
TLowe

The error message says you have duplicate row names and that
is not allowed.  Make sure you have the same number of elements
on each line of data as in the header.  If you have one more on each line
than on the header then the first data item on each line will be regarded
as the row name.  See ?count.fields

The rest of your message is not clear.

It sounds like you should sample x and y together using the
block bootstrap.  If you have the usual situation, x and y in columns
and observations in rows, then sample blocks of rows.

Even though observations in y are independent, you would take
advantage of that only for bootstrapping statistics that depend only
on y.

The answer to your second question is the same as the first - sample
blocks of observations, keeping x and y together.

There are some tools that already exist to help with creating these
types of visualization tools.  The playwith package appears to be one
such set of tools (I have not played with it much, so don't expect
details from me).

The tkrplot package is another one (I am more familiar with this one).
The slider function (relax and TeachingDemos package) and sliderv
function (TeachingDemos) also help here.  Try running the example for
the sliderv function and move the sliders around to see the effects.
(one of these days I am going to rewrite many of the demos in
TeachingDemos to use tkrplot)

Yes, it would be nice to have a general function that could look at the
arguments of a function, but this is not an easy task, for example, how
many arguments can you pass to the plot function?  Also which arguments
should use slider bars and which text widgets? (radio buttons are a bit
easier).  One option (that I think you are possibly suggesting above) is
to have each writer of a function include some type of metadata that a
general function could query and use to make decisions about what type
of control to use for that option including possible ranges of values.
I'll think some more about this approach.  I have plans to add some more
graphical demos to the TeachingDemos package that would do what you want
with subsets of the par arguments (there are too many to do all at once,
but one function could let you modify plotting type, cex, lwd, lty, col,
and similar options, it gets tricky when mar and mai both modify the
same thing in different ways and both take vectors rather than a single
number).

Some functions have arguments that depend on each other, making the GUI
for these cases is a bit more dificult in that you need to build in
those relationships (see the vis.gamma function in TeachingDemos for one
example, the rate and scale arguments are 2 different ways of specifying
the same thing).

One option (I would be willing to put this into TeachingDemos, or it may
want its own package at some point) is to write a general function that
takes a plotting expression/function as the first argument and a list as
the 2nd argument.  The list would include information on which type of
widget (slider, radio buttons, entry, ...) to use, what the range of
values are, and which argument to the plotting function they correspond
to.  The function would then create a gui (using tkrplot would be my
preference) that would modify those values.  Any function author that
wants users to be able to use this with their function just needs to
provide the list and possibly a not run example in the docs (and we can
create several predone lists in the package for common plotting
functions and subsets of "par" arguments).

I'm adding this to my list of bus projects to think about.

Any other thoughts,

Thanks a lot for the quick pointer, Richie. I will take a close look of the RTisean package.

The RTisean package has wiener filter functions (wiener1 and wiener2).

[R] Any package for deconvolution?






I want to run deconvolution of a time series by an impulse or point-spread
function through Wiener filter, regularized filter, Lucy-Richardson
method, or any other approaches. I searched the CRAN website and the
mailing list archive, but could not find any package for such a
deconvolution analysis. Does anybody know an existing R function for
deconvolution?

TIA,
Gang

Probably, but you're unlikely to get a correct explanation if you don't 
give us code to reproduce the problem.

 From the look of things, your real example is quite complex, which is 
probably why you didn't post it.  But the very act of simplifying it to 
something that is reasonable to post is quite likely to reveal to you 
what the problem is.

Bin,

I may be mis-interpreting your follow up query, but here goes:

You have presumably created a logistic regression model. The resultant
model object is called 'glmresult'.

If you use:

  fitted(glmresult)

it will return the fitted predicted values on a probability scale (0 -
1) for the original set of data that you used.

You can also use:

  predict(glmresult, type = "response")

The advantage of using predict.glm() is that you can apply the model
against new data.


If you want the linear predicted values on a log-odds scale, you can
use:

  glmresult$linear.predictors

or more easily:

  predict(glmresult)

See ?fitted and ?predict.glm for more information.


Let's use an example from ?infert:

model1 <- glm(case ~ spontaneous+induced, data=infert,family=binomial())

# Summary of fitted values on a probability scale
> summary(fitted(model1))
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
 0.1534  0.1534  0.2949  0.3347  0.3750  0.7511 


# Same
> summary(predict(model1, type = "response"))
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
 0.1534  0.1534  0.2949  0.3347  0.3750  0.7511 


# Get log-odds scale values
> summary(model1$linear.predictors)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
-1.7080 -1.7080 -0.8716 -0.7781 -0.5107  1.1050


# Same
> summary(predict(model1))
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
-1.7080 -1.7080 -0.8716 -0.7781 -0.5107  1.1050


If we wanted to do the log-odds scale to probability scale transform
manually, we could do:

> summary(exp(predict(model1)) / (1 + exp(predict(model1))))
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
 0.1534  0.1534  0.2949  0.3347  0.3750  0.7511 

Look familiar?

I would urge you to read through An Introduction To R, which is
available with your R installation or via the R web site under
Documentation. In addition, there are various books listed on the R web
site regarding model building and related subject matter. Which you
choose can be a matter of taste, but two I recommend would be:

William N. Venables and Brian D. Ripley. Modern Applied Statistics with
S. Fourth Edition. Springer, New York, 2002. ISBN 0-387-95457-0

Frank E. Harrell. Regression Modeling Strategies, with Applications to
Linear Models, Survival Analysis and Logistic Regression. Springer,
2001. ISBN 0-387-95232-2

How about this example?

## sample data frame with two columns
df <- data.frame(x = abs(rnorm(20)), y=abs(rnorm(20,2)))

## create new variables in df with an lapply call
df[c("cpctx","cptcty")] <- lapply(df, function(x) cumsum(x)/sum(x))

A possible improvement would be to construct the new column names in
the data frame automatically.

fft in stats gives you all you need, possibly combined with some time window in
package signal, which also has some higher level stuff. Do you really want to
interpret the "frequency spectrum" (whatever it is) with real, imaginary part
and signs?

The docs of spectro3D gives makes me cringe:

>>Following Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the short-term Fourier transform
cannot be precised in both time and frequency. >>

I know that's written in quite a few books, but that upside-down thinking has
been a source of confusion for generations of students and professors (of
biology, to say).

Subject: [R] generalized linear model with mixed effects
Message-ID: <47582114.8060200@mscc.huji.ac.il>

Hi,

    I need to fit a general generalized linear model, for observations 
on a response Y which is Gamma-distributed and observed in clusters.  So, if

    E(Y) = mu,

then for a suitable link function f, f(mu) is a (linear) function of 
both fixed and random effects.  Are there R packages or functions which 
fit these models, using either MLE or estimating-equation approaches?

Many thanks,
Sam

2) IT Satisfaction values (ITS), values = A - Completely, B - Mostly, C

Thanks Ben, that fixed the display within R.  However, even after changing
the display settings, the matrix elements still appear to be exported in
single precision.  The matrix object is being passed into my C routines as
an SEXP Numeric type, and somewhere along the way, some of the digits are
getting lost.  
Here's the relevant bit of my C code:

SEXP
divideMatrix(SEXP matrix_in, SEXP sub_height, SEXP sub_width, SEXP fileS)
...
if ( isMatrix(matrix_in) && isNumeric(matrix_in) )
{
	/* Use R macros to convert from SEXP to C types */
	matrix = REAL(matrix_in);
	height = INTEGER(GET_DIM(matrix_in))[0];
	width = INTEGER(GET_DIM(matrix_in))[1];
	subW = INTEGER_VALUE(sub_width);
	subH = INTEGER_VALUE(sub_height);
        ...
}

Am I using the wrong macro to convert into a double in C?  Any ideas?

Thanks,
Jeff Delmerico

I want to fit a fairly long main title for a plot, supposedly by changing row

Any suggestions? Shouldn't be that hard.

I wrote a little utility function for exactly this reason, which I use with
long titles. You may want to add calls to par to adjust the upper margin if
you are using raw graphical functionality (plot et al) - but lattice adjusts
the upper margin automatically so you wouldn't need to add anything else.


PrettyString <- function(theString, maxLength, collapse = "\n")
{
 	words <- unlist(strsplit(theString, " "))
 	wordLengths <- unlist(lapply(strsplit(words, ""), length))

 	if(max(wordLengths) > maxLength) 
		stop("maxChar must be increased due to string length")

 	count = wordLengths[1]
 	results = vector()
 	currentLine = words[1]

 	for(i in 2:length(words))
 	{
  		if((count + wordLengths[i] + 1) > maxLength)
  		{
   			results = c(results, currentLine)
   			currentLine = words[i]
   			count = wordLengths[i]
  		}
  		else
  		{
   			currentLine = paste(currentLine, words[i])
   			count = count + wordLengths[i] + 1
  		}
 	}
 	if(length(currentLine))
		results <- c(results, currentLine)

 	paste(results, collapse = collapse)
}


Knowing the R list, someone can probably reduce this function to 2 lines of
code.

That looks like a nice source for classical graphics, but I fear that it will
have a limited readience because of the language (Disclaimer: I am not working
for Time Magazine, my French is acceptable, and we drink their wine. ).

Even reading such stuff in German is difficult for me, because of the required 
switching between computer terms and translation.

For lattice, show.settings() is a good starter. Too bad it's miles from showing
the complete set of options. No student around looking for the first steps to 
fame?

Subject: [R] lm.influence under R2.6.1
Message-ID: <HGEMKEDILMPOCJBJOGBDIEPKDAAA.gerard.tromp@sanger.med.wayne.edu>

Greetings!

Recently when I tried to use lm.influence I get the following error:
Error in .Fortran("lminfl", model$qr$qr, n, n, k, as.integer(do.coef),  :
  Fortran symbol name "lminfl" not in DLL for package "base"

This occurs on both Linux and Windows platforms (details below).

Searching the mail lists and other sources indicates that the fortran code
for lminfluence (lminfl.f) was moved in the source code tree suggesting it
should be found in package stats. Not clear to me why the "hardcoded" path
is package base.
The offending line in the R code for lm.influence is:
res <- .Fortran("lminfl", model$qr$qr, n, n, k, as.integer(do.coef),

There were no other messages from people experiencing errors with
lm.influence on the mailing list.

Can someone else confirm that they are experiencing the same problem?

Also, as a workaround, is there a way of forcing R to look in stats for the
fortran symbol (similar to using the double and triple colon for addressing
specific namespaces)?

Try inserting \n into the title where you would like it to start on a
new line, e.g.:

plot(A,main="This is my really long title\nand it's so long\nthat I can
see just about half of it.")

You may need to give yourself more room in the margin for multi-line
titles (see ?par and the mar entry) and using the title function (rather
than in the plot) will let you specify the position of the title (line
argument).

Hope this helps,

You can insert newline characters ('\n') in the title:


plot(A, main = "This is my really long title\nand it's so long that I
can see\njust about half of it.")


The likelihood is that you will need to alter the vertical position of
the title to accommodate the line wrapping.

To do that, you can either use mtext() in lieu of the 'main' argument,
or consider adjusting par("mgp"), the first value of which is the
position of the plot title. See ?mtext and ?par.

You might also want to look at ?strwrap for a more general way of
wrapping long lines of text.

The 'table' function will give you the simple counts.  Plotting a table
with the 'plot' function gives common charts for this.  The 'CrossTable'
function in the gmodels package creates the table along with additional
information.  There are a lot of other functions for creating/working
with tables depending on what you are trying to do.

Hope this helps,

See ?table, for example:

  table(DMS, ITS)

You did not indicate the type of chart you want to create, but some
possibilities, using base graphics, would be barplot(), dotchart() and
mosaicplot(). The latter is in the vcd package on CRAN.

You are going to need to give us more information. 

It is not clear what you mean by not returning the correct data frame.
Why is it not correct? 

Where and what is 'resid'?  

What is 'x' and how is it used in the function?  

What is 'by = 0'? The 'by' argument values need to be quoted.

Please provide a small reproducible example as per the Posting Guide.

?table should work 

table (DMS, ITS)

I am not clear on what kind of chart you want.

will 
plot(DMS, ITS) do what you want?

Would you believe one line?

  paste(strwrap(theString, width = maxLength), collapse = "\n")

;-)

See ?strwrap as I noted previously.

If you just want to randomly <hint> sample <\hint> from a single column,
_independent of the other columns_, you can use:

  DF$Column[sample(nrow(DF))]

where DF$Column is the column of interest in your data frame 'DF'.

If you want to randomly sample entire rows from 'DF', you can use:

  DF[sample(nrow(DF)), ]

See ?sample for more information.

<snip>

I can run example(lm.influence) and example(influence.measures) without
issue on:

  R version 2.6.1 Patched (2007-11-26 r43541)

on an F8 Linux system.

I don't see anything immediately obvious in the NEWS file for 2.6.1
patched to suggest that something has changed here.

Can you provide a reproducible example here and/or try to upgrade to
patched?

I would also try to run:

  R --vanilla

from the command line to provide a clean environment to be sure that
none of the other packages that you are loading are causing conflicts.

Subject: [R] S3 and S4 clash
Message-ID: <47585913.5070206@pdf.com>

Hello: 

      How can I work around the conflict between the S3 and S4 
illustrated in the example below?  I'm developing a package that 
requires a function in 'stats4', but when 'stats4' is attached, it 
breaks my AIC function.  I could give my AIC function another name so it 
no longer uses the generic dispatch, but I wonder if there is another way. 

      Thanks,
      Spencer Graves

Subject: [R]  simple problems
Message-ID: <14200401.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello R users,
I have been looking through Help files and Nabble list for the answers for
these simple questions, but it seems to be fruitless.
1- in a data frame with two columns, x and y, how do I get the corresponding
value of x to, let's say, the minimum value of the y column (min (data$y)) ?
2- how do I solve a simple equation? Considering the equation y= exp(-x)^12,
I would like to find the values of x for,  for example, y=0.01, so
exp(-x)^12=0.01. How do I do that using R?
I know those a probably very, very simple questions, but for which I do not
seem to find the answer.
Thank you very much,
Marcia

I have learned something new - thanks for the strwrap info.

The problem with posting from Nabble is that by the time your post actually
gets to the list (2 hours after you posted it in this case) and you've
written some line like "Knowing the R list, someone can probably reduce this
function to 2 lines of code" half a dozen people have already shown exactly
how you can do that, making me look totally incompetent.

Ah well, such is life :)

Jim.

I'd say that was pretty clearly a bug in stats4 (which as I recall was 
needed to get around the scoping awkwardnesses of S4).

But could you not write a logLik method for your class?  E.g.

> logLik.bar <- function(object, ...) structure(pi, class="logLik", df=1)
> AIC(bar.tmp)
[1] -4.283185

Subject: [R] Java parser for R data file?
Message-ID: <44671.80.189.98.44.1196976341.squirrel@webmail.ebi.ac.uk>

Dear David,

You may also consider using the biocep project' tools and frameworks. they
provide an advanced  bridge that allow you to exchange between R and Java
any standard R Object and any mapped S4 object.
the object extracted to Java (an RList for you data) can be serialized to
a file (saved as a java object). you can then read the serialized object
very easily from java and this is obviously  much faster than parsing and
more elegant than a "proprietary" serialization/deserialization .

the easiest way to achieve this is to create the Serialized RList via the
Virtual R Workbench (Universal IDE for R).
you can run the R workbench on any kind of OS via the biocep sources:
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-srv/frontendapp/BIOCEP_README.txt

or just use this link to get the software installed on your machine if you
are using Mac OS or windows
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-srv/frontendapp/rworkbench.jnlp

create your data via the workbench R Console (you may also use the script
editor or just read your list from a file)
go to the menu "Java", choose "Save R/Java Object to local file"
select the name you've given to your list and choose a file name.

to retrieve your list in java, all you need is to add the RJB.jar to your
class path and use this simple code:

RList l=(RList)new ObjectInputStream(new
FileInputStream("J:/list.ser")).readObject();

and that's it.
this works for much more complex R objects (ExpressionSet..)

best wishes,

Karim

Subject: [R] Integral implicit function
Message-ID: <20071206224507660.00000003820@ae-030530>

Hi,

Could somebody help me with the following. I want to calculate the integral over an implicit function. I thought to integrate over a function depending on uniroot. In previous topics I found a thread about finding the root of an integral. And that works. But the other way around, does not work. Does R support this?

I included the following example. The function in the example is very easy and can be solved explicitly, but when it does not work for such an easy function it will certainly not work for a more difficult function. First the root of an integral (which works) and then the integral of a function dependent on uniroot:

# Calculating the root of an integral

a<- function(x,y)
    {x-y}

b<- function(y)
    {integrate(a,lower=1,upper=2,y=y)$value}

d<- uniroot(b,c(0,10))$root

print(d)

# Calculating the integral of a function dependent on uniroot

e<- function(u,v)
    {u-v}

f<- function(v)
    {uniroot(e,c(0,10),v=v)$root}

g<- integrate(f,lower=1,upper=2)$value

print(g)

Does anyone have suggestions how to proceed? By the way, the implicit function I am targeting does have a unique solution, it is only not explicitly solvable, i.e. in the example above, you cannot solve u as a function of v explicitly, so as to substitute it in the integrand. 


Thanks a lot in advance for your help,

Subject: [R] coxme() random effect syntax
Message-ID: <47586E53.1080606@kent.edu>

Hello:

I would like to run a Cox proportional hazards regression on crayfish 
dislodgement at different water velocities by crayfish size class and 
substrate (rock) type. Additionally, there is a covariate variable, rock 
movement that may be influencing crayfish dislodgment. So...

I have crayfish size class (CFSZCL) and substrate type (SUBSZ) as fixed 
factors influencing the dislodgment of crayfish at different water 
velocities (SLIPVEL). Thus, I am currently using the call:

coxph(Surv(SLIPVEL, FREEDOM) ~ CFSZCL + SUBSZ + CFSZCL:SUBSZ, data = 
data.table)

However, I would like to add rock movement (BEDLOAD) as a random 
co-variate, which is not possible with the coxph() function. Is it 
possible to do so with coxme() in the kinship package? If so, what is 
the proper syntax?

Thanks for any help.

I know there is solve for linear equations, but I do not know if there is
a generic solver for other equations.
You could implement it using a numerical approach (perhaps it is yet in some
package).

The chi-square does not need your two categorical variables to have equal levels, nor limitation for the number of levels.

The Chi-square procedure is as follow:
?^2=?_(All Cells)??(Observed-Expected)?^2/Expected

Expected Cell= E_ij=n((i^th RowTotal)/n)((j^th RowTotal)/n)

Degree of Freedom=df= (row-1)(Col-1)

This way should not give you any errors if your calculations are all correct. I usually use SAS for calculations like this. Below is a sample code I wrote to test whether US_State and Blood type are independent. You can modify it for your data and should give you no error.

data bloodtype;

Subject: [R] updating a helper function in a R package
Message-ID: <BAY120-W36138F3288572FAA2EA1EAC76F0@phx.gbl>


Hi list,

Sorry for the vague title, but here is the scenario.  

I?m writing an R package, let?s say, ?pkg1?, which contains 3 functions: f1, f2, f3.  f2 and f3 are helper functions for f1, i.e. f1 calls f2 which in turn calls f3.

f1 <- function(?) {
	?.
	f2()
	?
}

f2 <- function(?){
	?
	f3(?)
	?
}

f3 <- function(...){
       ....
}

Then, I wrote a new version of f3 and I want to test it.  With the old version of ?pkg1? already loaded into my R session, I tried just copy-and-paste the new ?f3? to R console and hope f1 will pick the new ?f3? up.  It obviously didn?t work.  I know it?s b/c the new f3 and old f3 are in different environments and when f1 is called, only old f3 is used.  Then I tried to change the environment of new f3 to the same as the old f3's by calling:

environment(f3) <- environment(pkg1:::f3)

but it wasn't working either.

So,  
1)	Could somebody help me to put all these into perspectives?
2)	Is there an easier way to update f3 without rebuilding the package? (by that I mean, writing the new version of f3 in a way that I only need to copy-and-paste to R console and I?m good to go.  I know it?s kind of stupid but I?m curious to know) 

I'm using R-2.5.1, on WinXP.

Many thanks,

?Tao

In the builtin Formaldehyde data frame find the value of carb (first column)
which corresponds to the least value of optden (second column):

with(Formaldehyde, carb[which.min(optden)])

Search between 0 and 1 for the root of the indicated function:

uniroot(function(x) 0.1 - exp(-x)^12, 0:1)

I beg your pardon ?

I'd rather use high-school algebra/analysis :
log(exp(-x)^12)=log(0.01)
12log(exp(-x)=log(0.01)
-12x=log(0.01)
x=-log(0.01)/12=log(100)/12

Rushing for a sophisticated numerical tool without thinking for an
explicit solution is easy, fast, lazy (I do that every day ...), but
deprives you of the process of understanding the problem.

Which was probably the point of this (probable) homework...

Beware : what follows is the advice of someone used to use RDBMS and SQL
to work with data ; as anyone should know, everything is a nail to a man
with a hammer. Caveat emptor...

Unless I misunderstand you, you are trying to treat piecewise a large
dataset made of a large number of reasonably-sized independent chunks.

What you're trying to do seems to me a bit reinventing SAS macro
language. What's the point ?

IMNSHO, "large" datasets that are used only piecewise are much better
handled in a real database (RDBMS), queried at runtime via, for example,
Brian Ripley's RODBC.

In your example, I'd create a table births with all your data + the
relevant year. Out of the top of my mind :

# Do that ONCE in the lifetime of your data : a RDBMS is probably more
# apt than R dataframes for this kind of management

library(RODBC)
channel<-odbcConnect(WhateverYouHaveToUseForYourFavoriteDBMS)

sqlSave(channel, tablename="Births",
        rbind(cbind(data.frame(Year=rep(1952,nrow(births.1952))),
                    births.1952),
              cbind(data.frame(Year=rep(1953,nrow(births.1953))),
                    births.1953),
# ... ^W^Y ad nauseam ...
))

rm(births.1951, births.1952, ...) # get back breathing space

Beware : certain data types may be tricky to save ! I got bitten by
Dates recently... See RODBC documentation, your DBMS documentation and
the "R Data Import/Export guide"...

At analysis time, you may use the result of the relevant query exactly
as one of your dataframes. instead of :
foo(... data=birth.1952, ...)
type :
foo(... data=sqlQuery(channel,"select * from \"Births\" where
\"Year\"=1952;", ...) # Syntax illustrating talking to a "picky" DBMS...

Furthermore, the variable "Year" bears your "d" information. Problem
(dis)solved.

You may loop (or even sapply()...) at will on d :
for(year in 1952:1978) {
  query<-sprintf("select * from \"Births\" where \"Year\"=%d;",year)
  foo(... data=sqlQuery(channel,query), ...)
  ...
}

If you already use a DBMS with some connection to R (via RODBC or
otherwise), use that. If not, sqlite is a very lightweight library that
enables you to use a (very considerable) subset of SQL92 to manipulate
your data.

I understand that some people of this list have undertaken the creation
of a sqlite-based package dedicated to this kind of large data management.

You can use the socket implementation of snow, with

     library(snow)
     cl <- makeCluster(rep("localhost", 2), type="SOCK")

to start up a cluster of 2 R processes.

Subject: [R] AIC v. extractAIC
Message-ID: <200712070014.lB70EH2t021662@citheronia.ucdavis.edu>


Hello,

I am using a simple linear model and I would like to get an AIC value.  I
came across both AIC() and extractAIC() and I am not sure which is best to
use.  I assumed that I should use AIC for a glm and extractAIC() for lm,
but if I run my model in glm the AIC value is the same if I use AIC() on an
lm object.  What might be going on?  Did I interpret these functions
incorrectly?

Thanks,
Ryan

Message-ID: <C37DD404.1578E%engrav@u.washington.edu>

As for news readers
I found R and R.mac and R.Bio on the sites you recommend, thank you very
much, they would avoid the individual emails, but then I would have to go
look at them, which might be Ok

Deluge? Well, there are from R and Bio and R-Mac every morning 30 or 35, and
10-15 more during the daytime, and ~50 deletes is painful

But then every morning one or two are useful so...

Still would be fun to understand why some R are junk and some are not

For example
Today received two emails from the same person, one junk and the other not

The Not Junk then went
from sweep.unicas.it
to phil2.ethz.ch 
to hypatia.math.ethz.ch

The Junk went 
from sweep.unicas.it directly to
to hypatia.math.ethz.ch

Otherwise the same, so why one junk and the other not?

Thank you

Subject: [R] Make natural splines constant outside boundary
Message-ID: <4758ABA1.3040708@ms.unimelb.edu.au>

Hi,

I'm using natural cubic splines from splines::ns() in survival 
regression (regressing inter-arrival times of patients to a queue on 
queue size). The queue size fluctuates between 3600 and 3900.

I would like to be able to run predict.survreg() for sizes <3600 and 
 >3900 by assuming that the rate for <3600 is the same as for 3600 and 
that for >4000 it's the same as for 4000 (i.e., keep the splines cubic 
within the boundaries but make them constant outside the boundaries).

(By default, natural splines will be linear outside the boundaries, 
which is very bad here because the predictions grow without bound. 
Setting the boundary knots to extreme values such as (0, 10000) doesn't 
help, because there are no intermediate knots to constrain the spline 
and you get a very large cubic curve between these boundaries and the 
observed sizes.)

Any suggestions?

Thanks,
Gad

Subject: [R] Segmented regression
Message-ID: <200712070235.lB72ZEI6012426@dpi-gw1.dpi.qld.gov.au>

Hello Vito,

Thanks for your reply and apologies for not being clearer. 

I'd like to fit a three-segmented relationship to each level but have only 3 unique breakpoints. The result would be 9 slopes, one of which would be zero.

I achieved this by finding the 3 breakpoint with:

init.bp <- c(297.4,639.6,680.6)
lm.1 <- lm(y~tt+group,data=df)
seg.1 <- segmented(lm.1, seg.Z=~tt, psi=list(tt=init.bp))

The starting values of init.bp came from a grid search and are that which minimised residuals.

I then used these breakpoints to get the 9 coefficients (which I omitted from original email for brevity):

df.KW <- df[df$group=="KW",]
lm.KW <- lm(y~tt,data=df.KW)
seg.KW <- segmented(lm.KW, seg.Z=~tt, psi=list(tt=seg.1$psi[,"Est."]),control = list(it.max = 0))

And similarly for the other 2 levels. This was done just for plotting purposes, my main interest is in the identification of the breakpoints.

Btw I'd appreciate a copy of your rnews article.

Thanks for you help,

Brendan.

Dear Brendan,
I am not sure to understand your code..

It seems to me that your are interested in fitting a one-breakpoint segmented relationship in each level of your grouping variable

If this is the case, the correct code is below.
In order to fit a segmented relationship in each group you have to define the relevant variable before fitting, and to constrain the last slope to be zero you have to consider the `minus' variable..(I discuss these points in the submitted Rnews article..If you are interested, let me know off list).

If my code does not fix your problem, please let me know,

Best,
vito

##--define the group-specific segmented variable:
X<-model.matrix(~0+factor(group),data=df)*df$tt
df$tt.KV<-X[,1] #KV
df$tt.KW<-X[,2]   #KW
df$tt.WC<-X[,3]   #WC

##-fit the unconstrained model
olm<-lm(y~group+tt.KV+tt.KW+tt.WC,data=df)
os<-segmented(olm,seg.Z=~tt.KV+tt.KW+tt.WC,psi=list(tt.KV=350,
tt.KW=500, tt.WC=350))
#have a look to results:
with(df,plot(tt,y))
with(subset(df,group=="RKW"),points(tt,y,col=2))
with(subset(df,group=="RKV"),points(tt,y,col=3))
points(df$tt[df$group=="RWC"],fitted(os)[df$group=="RWC"],pch=20)
points(df$tt[df$group=="RKW"],fitted(os)[df$group=="RKW"],pch=20,col=2)
points(df$tt[df$group=="RKV"],fitted(os)[df$group=="RKV"],pch=20,col=3)


#constrain the last slope in group KW
tt.KW.minus<- -df$tt.KW
olm1<-lm(y~group+tt.KV+tt.WC,data=df)
os1<-segmented(olm1,seg.Z=~tt.KV+tt.KW.minus+tt.WC,psi=list(tt.KV=350, 
tt.KW.minus=-500, tt.WC=350))
#check..:-)
slope(os1)

with(df,plot(tt,y))
with(subset(df,group=="RKW"),points(tt,y,col=2))
with(subset(df,group=="RKV"),points(tt,y,col=3))
points(df$tt[df$group=="RWC"],fitted(os1)[df$group=="RWC"],pch=20)

  The documentation for these functions does explain what's going on,
albeit fairly tersely.  The bottom line is that you should be OK with either
one, provided that you stick to one or the other.

set.seed(1001)
x = runif(100)
y = 1 + 2*x+3*x^2+rnorm(100,sd=0.02)

lm1 = lm(y~x)
lm2 = lm(y~x+I(x^2))

## different
AIC(lm1,lm2)
extractAIC(lm1)
extractAIC(lm2)

## the same
AIC(lm1)-AIC(lm2)
extractAIC(lm1)[2]-extractAIC(lm2)[2]

lm3 = glm(y~x)
lm4 = glm(y~x+I(x^2))

## the same
AIC(lm4)
extractAIC(lm4)

This what you want to you email filtering for.  Create a (sub)folder
named "r-help", setup an email filter that sends all message that has
a subject starting with "[R] " to that folder.  That way they will not
clutter up your inbox, but you can still browser the r-help messages.

You haven't told us your email client, but pretty much any client I
know of supports this.  I use gmail as my client and there it is very
simple.  This way reading message is no different from reading them
via a news reader.

FYI, I very very rarely get false positives (from the r-help lists)
and hardly any spam for that sake (thanks!) and I've been on the list
for a long time.  I couldn't find a single one during the last 30 days
in my gmail spam box.

It is impossible to tell why some of your message are falsely
classified as spam without know what your email client is.  Some
clients have there own build in spam filtering that you can train by
pressing "This is spam/This is not spam", whereas others rely on their
email provider to analyze all messages and add a spam score in the
email header and then you can set up the client to filter those out
without much local analysis.  The latter is common at universities.

As already been suggested, it is more likely that this something that
you email provider/sys adm should be able to help you out with.  To me
it sounds unlikely that there is something "wrong" with the R messages
or that R mail server is at fault.

Hope this helps

Try this:

matplot(xxx[,1], xxx[2:4], type = "l")
with(xxx, {
	segments(x, z1, x, z2)
	points(x, z1)
	points(x, z2)
})

Omit the two points commands if you don't want circles at the ends of
the segments.

Message-ID: <1129.60.241.49.44.1197008645.squirrel@webmail.ics.mq.edu.au>

I am using read.table and keep on getting this message.

The function is confusing my first column with a row.names column.  I have
checked the table carefully using excel and it seems quite symetric and
with a name at the top of each column.

This is what I am using:

form1 = read.table("c:/horses/form.tbl", sep="\t", header = T)

and this is the top few rows of the table:

fields.result	fields.age	fields.sex	fields.barrier	horse.winnings	
horse.form.ran	horse.form.win	horse.form.place	horse.form.at.this.track.ran	horse.form.at.this.track.win	horse.form.at.this.track.place	horse.form.at.this.distance.ran	horse.form.at.this.distance.win	horse.form.at.this.distance.place	horse.form.with.this.jockey.ran	horse.form.with.this.jockey.win	horse.form.with.this.jockey.place	horse.form.with.this.going.ran	horse.form.with.this.going.win	horse.form.with.this.going.place	rider.rides.last.3	rider.places.last.3	trainer.rides.last.3	trainer.places.last.3

Can anyone suggest whats wrong or a workaround.

The message seems to be messed up but if your data has one more column
than the header then it will assume the first column is the row names.
Use the R count.fields function to diagnose this.

Subject: [R]  what actually a logistic regression fits
Message-ID: <14207920.post@talk.nabble.com>


Dear all:
    I did the following because I was not sure what a logistic regression
fits ."small.glm" is a glm fit , setting the family to be binomial.

>fitted(small.glm)->p
>log(p/(1-p))->left   
> for(i in 1:length(coef(small.glm))){
+  coef(small.glm)[i]*model.matrix(small.glm)[,i]->res[,i]
+ }
> apply(res,1,sum)->right
> plot(left,right)  #I got a straight line whose slope was about 1
Therefore ,I am almost sure that what a logistic regression fits is
log(p/(1-p))~b0+b1*x.
Is that right?

Hi

No error message? It seems to me that it is OK. There is of course limited 
width for printout on screen (see GUI preferences/console columns), and 
therefore everything which exceeds specified limits is printed on second 
and subsequent row.

try

dim(form1) or str(form1) for evaluation of your read data frame.

Regards
Petr

I have to second that, the same for me. The only way to access this list is via
gmane, otherwise orbitl.com (a Ceylon-based anti-spamming list) will jump in. We
have a dynamic address, so this list seems ban whole ranges.

I have tried to remove me from orbitl; it may have worked or not, because of the
dynamic address I do not always track. I tried to contact the webmaster at ETH
twice, but got no response. 

This is an annoyance; I know that I should contact orbitl every time, but since
that organization is a mess, it better would be removed from the ETH
anti-spamming list.

Subject: [R] testing independence of categorical variables

Hi

Well, R does exactly what it says. From help page.

"Otherwise, x and y must be vectors or factors of the same length"

I do not know SAS but I presume that

> tables bloodtype*state

gives you something like

tab <- table(bloodtype, state)

and

chisq.test(tab)

shall give you the expected result. You can also do directly 
chisq.test(bloodtype, state). But what you cannot do is to test vectors 
unequal **lengths**, and that is what he did. I beleve that you can not do 
it in SAS either.
 
 x<-sample(letters[1:3], 10, replace=T)
 x
 [1] "c" "a" "c" "c" "a" "c" "a" "c" "a" "a"
 y<-sample(1:5, 20, replace=T)
> y
 [1] 2 5 1 1 2 5 2 3 1 5 5 5 1 5 5 3 2 2 5 1
> chisq.test(x,y)
Error in chisq.test(x, y) : 'x' and 'y' must have the same length
 x<-sample(letters[1:3], 20, replace=T)

> chisq.test(x,y)

        Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  x and y 
X-squared = 4.7937, df = 6, p-value = 0.5705

Warning message:
In chisq.test(x, y) : Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect

Subject: [R] paradox about the degree of freedom in a logistic regression
 model
Message-ID: <14208306.post@talk.nabble.com>


 Dear all:
   "predict.glm" provides an example to perform logistic regression when the
response variable is a tow-columned  matrix. I find some paradox about the
degree of freedom  .
 > summary(budworm.lg)

Call:
glm(formula = SF ~ sex * ldose, family = binomial)

Deviance Residuals: 
     Min        1Q    Median        3Q       Max  
-1.39849  -0.32094  -0.07592   0.38220   1.10375  

Coefficients:
            Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)    
(Intercept)  -2.9935     0.5527  -5.416 6.09e-08 ***
sexM          0.1750     0.7783   0.225    0.822    
ldose         0.9060     0.1671   5.422 5.89e-08 ***
sexM:ldose    0.3529     0.2700   1.307    0.191    
---
Signif. codes:  0 ?***? 0.001 ?**? 0.01 ?*? 0.05 ?.? 0.1 ? ? 1 

(Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1)

    Null deviance: 124.8756  on 11  degrees of freedom
Residual deviance:   4.9937  on  8  degrees of freedom
AIC: 43.104

Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4

This is the data set used in regression:
  numdead numalive sex ldose
1        1       19   M     0
2        4       16   M     1
3        9       11   M     2
4       13        7   M     3
5       18        2   M     4
6       20        0   M     5
7        0       20   F     0
8        2       18   F     1
9        6       14   F     2
10      10       10   F     3
11      12        8   F     4
12      16        4   F     5

     The degree of freedom is 8. Each row in the example is thought to be
one observation. If  I extend it to be a three column data.frame, the first
denoting the whether the individual is alive , the secode denoting the sex,
and the third "ldose",there will be 12*20=240 observations. 
     Since my data set is one of the second type , I wish to know whether
the form of data set affects the result of regression ,such as the degree of
freedom.
   Dose anybody have any idea about this? Thank all who read this message.
   Regards,
   Bin Yue

This doesn't look right to me, but it might give you a start:

library(plotrix)
brkdn.plot(c("y1","y2","y3"),NA,"x",xxx,
  dispbar=FALSE,col=2:4,ylim=c(-3,10))
dispbars(xxx$x,xxx$y1,xxx$z1,col=2)
dispbars(xxx$x-0.12,xxx$y2,xxx$z2,col=3)

What about ?by, something like this (still untested):

model.per.country <- by( data, data$COUNTRY, function (x) {
    glm(dependent.var ~ FEMALE + AGE + EDUCLIN, family = binomial, data = x)
})

Or

model.per.country <- by( data, data$COUNTRY, 
  glm , dependent.var ~ FEMALE + AGE + EDUCLIN, family = binomial )


Cheers,

Romain

use cut fuction.

Create two wectos with intervals and lables acording documentation. Very 
simple and fast solution.

Cut and aggregate

fac <- cut(Data[,1], seq(5,30,5))

> aggregate(Data[,-1],list(fac), mean)
  Group.1 VarA VarB
1  (5,10] 1000  500
2 (10,15] 1030  530
3 (15,20] 1080  580
4 (20,25] 1130  630
5 (25,30] 1180  680

is close, but you need to add first level in fac into the second.

lev<-levels(fac)
levels(fac)<-lev[c(2,2,3,4,5)]

> aggregate(Data[,-1],list(fac), mean)
  Group.1 VarA VarB
1 (10,15] 1025  525
2 (15,20] 1080  580
3 (20,25] 1130  630
4 (25,30] 1180  680

Not sure if it is the most elegant solution but it works.

Petr

Subject: [R] if/else for plot/lines?

I'm interested in writing a function that constructs a new plot on the
current graphics device if no plot exists there yet, but adds lines to
the existing plot if a plot is already there.  How can I do this?  It
seems to me that the exists() function might be co-opted to do this, but
it's not obvious how.

Many thanks,

It can sometimes be the case that a message which you have
posted takes a long time to be sent to you by the R list,
while it may have been distributed to many other list
readers quite quickly. At times I have experienced delays
of up to 3 hours (though normally it is within say 15 minutes).

One way to check whether your posting has reached the list
is to check in the R-help archives at:

  https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help

Select the most recent month and "View by Date". Your message
should appear near the end of this archive within a few minutes
of being accepted by the R-help list server.

But there is always also the possibility eperienced by Dieter:

This sort of thing can paralyse innocent users.

A couple of years ago, when I was using dial-up from home on
the BT Openworld ISP service (which allocated a dynamic IP
address on connection), I found at one point that I was
unable to send email to any UK academic institution whatever!

The error message was:
  550 host is listed in rbl-plus.mail-abuse.ja.net
The reason was that JA.NET (the UK Joint Academic Network)
had subscribed to a blacklisting service which included
every known dynamic IP address and of course the IP addresses
which BT gave me (the "host" in the above message) were
included.

For a while I worked round this because I had a log-in
account on a machine at Manchester University, so I could
dial-up, log in, and mail from there. That host was
acceptable ...

But then I dumped BT (and not just for that reason) and
switched ISP to Zen.co.uk, who gave me a permanent fixed
IP address. This evaded that particular problem.

But then I was hit by SORBS (e.g. https://www.us.sorbs.net )
which had blacklisted *every* IP address owned by Zen,
dynamic or static, apparently on the grounds that some of
these had (allegedly) been used to send spam and SORBS had
received complaints. Many institutions at the time used SORBS.

SORBS had (and still has) the interesting rule:

  "Third and finally, if you are really not a spammer,
   or you are truly reformed, de-listing is relatively
   easy, and you can choose one of two options:

    * Donate US$50 to a charity or trust approved by,
      and not connected with, SORBS for each spam
      received related to the listing. This is referred
      to as the SORBS 'fine'.
 
    * Wait for a period of 1 year for each spam received
      related to the listing (e.g. if 3 spams were received,
      wait 3 years)."

Clearly this made it out of the question for an ISP to get
themselves removed from the SORBS list, since it could amount
to many 1000s of $$! (And then there's the next time ... ).

The situation, as I understand it, was resolved when the
institutions stopped using SORBS, and I have had no such
trouble since.

I conclude from experiences like this that institutions
have a responsibility to treat bona-fide users fairly.
This means in particular avoiding "automated" blacklisting
of totally innocent people who have had the misfortune
to get on a blacklist through no fault of their own.

And this can, in turn, mean taking a close look at the
blacklisting services they consult, in order to ensure
that making use of them will not penalise people unfairly.

It's all very well for people working within institutions
(whose IP addresses will generally be "clean") to be unaware
of this kind of issue. But people connecting from outside
will be penalised unless care is taken to be fair to all.

Best wishes to all,
Ted.

What is wq? Which version of R? WHich version of the pvclust package (I 
guess we are talking about that one?)? We also need a reproducible 
example, as the posting guide suggests.

Subject: [R] manipulation of list of matrices
Message-ID: <OF111880A1.BB6DBDD5-ONC12573AA.003AEB7E-802573AA.003D17A3@abnamro.com>

Folks,

I have a list of correlation matrices of equities, say, and I need to 
manipulate each matrix: I weight each equity by its median absolute 
correlation against all the other equities, such that the equity with the 
least such correlation gets the highest weight. Something like min(over 
all average correlations) / average correlation of equity

So I do the following:

> a <- lapply(1:1000, function(n) {b <- matrix(runif(45*45, min = -1, max 
= 1), ncol = 45); diag(b) <- 1; b})

I write the following function:

constructCorrelationWeights <- function(rollCorr, FUN = median)
{
    corWt <- sapply(rollCorr,
                    function(corMat)
                    {
                        wt <- apply(corMat, 1, function(x) FUN(abs(x)))
                        min(wt) / wt
                    })
    t(corWt)
}

> system.time(corWt <- constructCorrelationWeights(a))
[1] 33.42 18.03 79.55

Is there a more efficient and cleverer way to accomplish this? 

Many thanks,

Murali

If you mean an R *package* and tell us what functionalities are 
available in "Splus7.0+ library correlatedData", we might be able to help.

exists() will not help with graphics devices, whose state is not stored in 
R objects that exists() can test for.

Note that it is rare for a graphics device to be open and not contain a 
plot.  But in those circumstances par("usr") will be c(0,1,0,1) which 
would be unusual after a plot.

A simple way to test if a non-null device is active is dev.cur() > 1.

However, I doubt if you want to add lines to any old plot that happens to 
be on the device, and there is no general way to tell if the existing 
plot is suitable (it need not be the last plot made, for example).
So I can only see this goal as achievable within a constrained set of 
circumstances.

(A further complication is that a graphics device can display either base 
or grid graphics, and you can't add base graphics to a grid plot or v.v.)

That test will occasionally misclassify, because some private replies 
might keep the [R] in the subject.  A more reliable test, if you can 
work with the undisplayed message headers, is to look for "r-help" in 
the List-Id: header.

You indicate that the ODBC connection to Teradata on Windows is working for
you.  This may be a newbie question, but I'm not getting beyond an
apparently successful connection to the Teradata...

Apparently there are some data conversion errors... do data types need to be

Message-ID: <200712071436.56046.t.zumbrunn@unibas.ch>

Hello

Since I changed my X11 settings to a Xinerama setup, calls to x11() result in 
windows with a width half the size of the one specified by the corresponding 
parameter. Furthermore, x axis labels are overlapping. Other devices (e.g. 
pdf()), are not affected by these distortions.

Did anybody have the same problem, and if so, how did you solve it? ( I'm 
using openSUSE 10.3 on a x86 architecture.)

First, 'subset' is an argument to glm(), but for some reason you did not 
use it.  Your subject line is quite misleading, and had it been the more 
accurate

 	Adding a 'data' argument to glm messes up factors?

you might have realised the problem.

Second, your models are fitted to different datasets: the first to objects 
in your workspace, and the second to columns of data.all. Since you have 
not (as we asked) given a reproducible example we cannot know what those 
differences are, but differences in the datasets will be the key.

Third, the best way to fit linear models is lm(), not 
glm(family=gaussian).

Yes. Never use the deviance in binary logistic regression. Only use
differences in deviance between models, each of which satisfy
requirements for asymptotic theory (in your case, you could compare your
model with that described by sex*factor(ldose)). Another striking
example is this

y <- rbinom(1000, prob=.5, size=1)
summary(glm(y~-1,binomial))

now try it with different data

y <- rbinom(1000, prob=.01, size=1)
summary(glm(y~-1,binomial))

and think about it. Then consider the same thing with y~1.

As Brian keeps telling me, there IS a sense in which the residual
deviances make sense in such cases, but it is not as a means of testing
the model adequacy.

I think that your first step should be to read the documentation of 
whatever software you are using here (you didn't say).

You are getting iconv errors because you set an invalid encoding.  You 
haven't shown us all the steps you used, and in one of those not shown you 
will find your error.  If you don't understand what they are needed for, 
at least at first accept the default arguments for things like encodings.

You will find people more willing to help you if you give them credit for 
their work: you are using a contributed package here without giving *any* 
credit, not even its name.

Message-ID: <4759E21B.2080901@otter-rsch.com>

While it may be true that for coxme models the "standard errors"
are not very good approximations, it is always useful to have them
to compare with other diagnostics such as likelihood ratios and
profile likelihoods.  It is interesting to hear that with the currently
used methodology

   "Computation of the se of the random effect turns out to be very hard"

because if you simply use AD Model Builders Random Effects module to
formulate the model you will get the standard errors calculated for free
without any more effort.

    Cheers,

Subject: [R]  SQLiteDF SQLITE ERROR after attach
Message-ID: <14214520.post@talk.nabble.com>


Dear list,

i have installed SQLiteDF (and SQlite 3.5.3 too)

After the suggested dataframe generation  
   
    iris.sdf <- sqlite.data.frame(iris)

i have close R and than restart it for verify the correct load of dataframe
:

the file data1 is saved in the usual folder .SQLiteDF

after the command :
attachSdf("c:/R/Report/.SQLiteDF/data1.db","iris.sdf")
R give this error
SQLITE ERROR (line 295 at sqlite_workspace.c): column internal_name is not
unique
SQLITE ERROR (line 463 at sqlite_workspace.c): near "data1": syntax error

if i try a new solution (after delete all the .SQLite folder)
iris.sdf <- sqlite.data.frame(iris)
iris.sdf1<-inameSdf(iris.sdf) 

      attachSdf(".SQLiteDF/iris.db","iris.sdf")

OR  attachSdf(".SQLiteDF/iris.db","iris.sdf1")

the message is the same
Errore in attachSdf(".SQLiteDF/iris.db", "iris.sdf") : 
        .SQLiteDF/iris.db is not a valid SDF.


perhaps anyone know thi problem

thanks in advance

Roberto Iacopetti

Check out what R does with names that are not syntaxically correct.

You might want to look at the ggplot2 package,
http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/, which exposes plots as objects that can be
easily manipulated.

In-Reply-To: <6phve7b8rfj.fsf@gopher4.fhcrc.org>
Message-ID: <003c01c838ec$9d797840$7400a8c0@AWALL>

Thanks so much Martin,

This method is definitely more straightforward.  And you are right I don't
think I was doing anything wrong before. However, I thought that rank, would
rank the highest 1st, however after looking at the results using your
methods, I realized it ranks the lowest number 1.  So I modified it for
rank>18500.  And now I'm getting 300 rows for which the intensity is
consistenly high.

However, I am still laking some information.  For the results I can get a
matrix of 300 rows and the corresponding intensities (from m) or rank (from
h), but what I really want is the name of the original row, which
corresponds to a specific spot on the array).

I did msubset<-m[hrows,] and as mentioned I just get the rows numbered
1-300, while I want to essentially pickout the 300 rows from the original
19,000 rows maintaing the original row designation as it corresponds to a
specific gene.

Thanks again for any suggestions,

Alison

Hi Alison --

I'm not sure where your problem is coming from, but R can help you to
more efficiently do your task. Skipping the bioc terminology and data
structures, you have a matrix

> m <- matrix(runif(100000), ncol=10)

you'd like to determine the rank of values in each column

> r <- apply(m, 2, rank)

identfiy those with high rank

> h <- r < 500

and find the rows for which the rank is always high

> hrows <- apply(h, 1, all)

you can then use hrows to subset your original matrix (m[hrows,]) or
otherwise, e.g., how many rows with high rank

> sum(hrows)
[1] 0

or perhaps the distribution of the number of columns in which high
ranking genes occur.

> table(apply(h, 1, sum))

   0    1    2    3    4 
5996 3132  765  100    7

That gave me simply 10's on the diagonals of the table and the plot was 
not very satisfying. I suggest this alternate example:

tbl<-r2dtable(1,c=4*c(15,12,8,5),r=4*c(20,10,5,5))

I had the same problem one time. It was because I did a copy paste under
excel that is to say i put some data from an other file at the following of
the file, and R thought it was duplicate row.names. So i did two exports on
R and after i did a rbind... I don't know if you did a copy paste like i did
but the problem can be that. I did not find an other solution and i think
other easier way are possible.

Read your file in without row names and check for duplicates:

DF <- read.table(myfile, skip = 1, header = FALSE)
myfile[duplicated(DF[[1]]), ]  # list rows with duplicated column 1

Hi,

Thanks for your reply. I am looking for an R package that has the same 
functionality of the glme() function within the correlatedData library in 
SPlus 6.2 or above. This generic function fits a generalized linear 
mixed-effects model in the formulation described in Breslow and Clayton 
(1993) but allowing for nested random effects. The within-group errors are 
allowed to be correlated and/or have additional heteroscedastic patterns. 
Regards, Hakan Demirtas

I think it would be useful if you are a bit more specific by telling us 
which function you were using.
I assume now that you used
library(pamr)
pamr.geneplot(...)

Is this correct?
If you check the package description, you will see that you are allowed 
to make changes to the software (GPL 2.0).
Now, have a look at
pamr.geneplot

Pretty much in the end, you will find the plotting command. What I did 
now was to basically slightly modify the function by adding two 
arguments for the labels of the x-axis and the y-axis to the function 
definition. As you will see with the provided example, you can make your 
own labels for the x-axis and y-axis now.

I hope this helps,
Roland

I think it only takes a longer time, when it ends up

Your problems do not at all concern the webmaster of ETH,
nor the webmaster of the math department of ETH (which is
physically hosting the mailman interface and archives to the R lists).

It does concern the "E-mail masters" of ETH (to a very small extent,
maybe more in the future), and  STAT.MATH.ETHZ.CH specifically,
and I am one of them {and am BCC'ing this message to another one}.

    TH> This sort of thing can paralyse innocent users.

Yes.  But it happens more and more, not only at ETH.

The "war on spam" has not been won, and it is 
`` costing lives every day'' (lost e-mails).

You may not be aware how much of all e-mail traffic is
spam/viruses nowadays ("90%" is one imprecise citation).
And that's not counting the hacker's attempt to break into mail
servers, notably if they are at "prestigious" places, DNS
attacks, etc.

Currently, we *must* use blacklist services, or our servers
would crumble.

The exact set of blacklist services of course is something that
has to be carefully selected by ``the e-mail masters'' 
and if you can show us that one of the blacklist servers has
become of quite reputable quality, we have to stop using that
specific one.

Hi Alison --

It's a funny twist of terminology, isn't it? high rank (we're #1!)
corresponds to low value. Maybe a wimpy stats joke? Anyway, (a) if m
is assigned rownames (e.g., from the appropriate column of the 'genes'
data frame in the limma object, rownames(m) <- maList$genes$GeneName)
they'll be caried through the analysis and (b) if you've extracted m
from a limma MAList, then subsetting the MAList with hrow
(maList[hrow,]) will give you a new MAList with all the info carrying
through. This would be the better way to go.

Perhaps you have recently switched to gmail?  It's a "feature" of
gmail that you won't see your mails to a mailing list until someone
replies to them.  (I think this is because gmail only stores one copy
of the message, and that message appears only in your sent mail until
it gets a reply).

Subject: [R] using "eval(parse(text)) " , gsub(pattern, replacement, x) ,
	to process "code" within a loop/custom function
In-Reply-To: <346709.39944.qm@web59302.mail.re1.yahoo.com>

Use the same names (births, temp, ...) in each Rdata file and then load
each file into its own environment or proto object:

	library(proto); x1951 <- proto() # or x1951 <- new.env()
	load("1951.rda", envir = x1951)

Then pass the environment or proto object to each of your functions:

	f <- function(x) x$difference <- x$births - x$temp
	f(x1951)

The above completely avoids renaming variables and instead treats each
year as an object. If you use proto objects the home page
is: http://r-proto.googlecode.com

The simplest way would be to have a flag, an indicator variable that 
stores a value that indicates if a plot has been done before.  Something 
like this

plot (do my first plot here...)
is.plot=T

.... later in the code...

if (is.plot) {plot (do new plot here)} else {lines(add lines to the 
previous plot)}

Look at package lme4.

If you have code set up for glme(), adapting it to glmmPQL in package MASS 
will be rather easier, but if you are starting afresh I would suggest you 
learn the lme4 syntax straight away.

Message-ID: <f8e6ff050712071102o58d7de95iaf491b11e016652e@mail.gmail.com>

fda 1.2.3
========================

Version 1.2.3 of the fda package has just been released. This version adds to
previous versions a script to create most of the figures of chapter 6 of
"Applied Functional Data Analysis" by Ramsay and Silverman. Other changes
offer simpler calls to time warping / registration and functional principal
component functions.

The fda package supports the books "Functional Data Analysis" and "Applied
Functional Data Analysis" by Bernard Silverman and James Ramsay. Functional
data analysis, which lots of us like to call "FDA", is about the analysis of
information on curves or functions. FDA is a collection statistical techniques
for answering questions like, "What are the main ways in which the curves vary
from one to another?" In fact, most of the questions and problems associated
with multivariate data (PCA, LDA, clustering, ...) have functional
counterparts. More information about FDA can be found at
http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/.

I've complex problem and this's idealization of it:

v=1:10

fx<-function(x){
v[x]=v[x]*2}

fy<-function(y){
fx(y)}

for(i in 1:10){
fy(i)}

How to modife expresion (and only that):
{v[x]=v[x]^2}

to achive the redefinetion of the values of vector v, the result should 
be: v=(1:10)*2. I think, that could be done with using of internal 
functions, but I'm not the programmer.
Thanks for help

This should work:

panel.cor <- function(x, y, groups, subscripts, ...)
{
    require(grid)
    g <- groups[subscripts]
    ug <- unique(g)
    stopifnot(length(ug) == 2)
    y1 <- y[g == ug[1]]
    y2 <- y[g == ug[2]]
    grid.text(label = round(cor(y1, y2), 3),
              x = unit(0.5, "npc"),
              y = unit(0.5, "npc"))
}

xyplot(y1 + y2 ~ id | groups,
       panel = function(...) {
           panel.xyplot(...)
           panel.cor(...)
       })

See ?grid.text for finer control over placement.

Hi Alison --

It's a funny twist of terminology, isn't it? high rank (we're #1!)
corresponds to low value. Maybe a wimpy stats joke? Anyway, (a) if m
is assigned rownames (e.g., from the appropriate column of the 'genes'
data frame in the limma object, rownames(m) <- maList$genes$GeneName)
they'll be caried through the analysis and (b) if you've extracted m
from a limma MAList, then subsetting the MAList with hrow
(maList[hrow,]) will give you a new MAList with all the info carrying
through. This would be the better way to go.

You are looking for RExcel, which does exactly that.  Full documentation
and examples are included in the package.

http://sunsite.univie.ac.at/rcom/download/devel/

If you don't have R-2.6.1 yet, get the whole R system with
the RExcel installed

RAndFriendsSetup2061V1.82.exe


Otherwise, just get the RExcel installer, either

RExcel.installer_1.80-18.zip

or

RExcel.installer_1.80-18.tar.gz


Also look at the main RExcel/rcom site
http://sunsite.univie.ac.at/rcom/

Subject: [R] How to prevent fix() from converting Dates into numeric
Message-ID: <4759CEE4.30809@grieg.uib.no>

Dear list members

Here is a strange problem that I have had for a long time, without 
finding out how to solve it. Whenever I use fix() on a data.frame that 
contains Dates, these are converted to numerics. As shown by the very 
simple example:

a <- data.frame(var1 = 1, today = Sys.Date() )
a
fix(a)
a

Why is that? And can anything be done against it?

Many thanks for your help!

In a post on R-devel, Prof Ripley add the following comment

I use the dim(names)[1] and dim(x)[2] along with length(x) with varying 
levels of frustration depending on the object which I am trying to get 
the dimensions.  I found the reference to seq_len interesting since it 
is a function that I have never seen (probably just missed it reading 
the docs).

I was hoping someone could expand on the benefits of seq_len.

Take a look at
R/Scilab (D)COM Server V2.50 and RExcel V1.75 found at
http://cran.r-project.org/other-software.html

I have experimented with it for non R users to run basic R functions or 
custom models.  I like theI did find a problem with the VBA math 
function calls in the xla file on the computer that I was using.  I just 
added VBA. to all the left, mid, etc functions.


I can provide my modified .xla file if you wanted it.

fix on a data frame calls edit: see ?edit.data.frame.  The help for 
fix does say

   Editing an \R object may change it in ways other than are obvious: see
   the comment under \code{\link{edit}}.

The simple answer is not to use fix() or edit() on other than the data 
frames they are documented to work on.

I find it absolutely essential to have a client that can display mail
in threads.  Deleting mail a thread at a time is an order of magnitude
more efficient.  Nabble does a fairly good job of showing threads, but
I would prefer to download every message and delete the threads I'm
ignoring.  Even on a good connexion, the delays downloading individual
messages add up.  And gmail is slower still.  Another advantage of
your own client is that you can use a monospaced font which is far
easier for reading code which is bound to happen on a list like this.

Most people I know have the misfortune of not having access to a mail
client that displays threads[1], but for anyone who has control over
such things, in the Windows world, I know Thunderbird is fairly good,
but if you're fortunate enough to be allowed to use Linux, there is
Mutt or you might like Emacs as a mail client which both do threads
very well without the need to use a mouse -- which I consider a huge
bonus.

[....]


|> 
|> Still would be fun to understand why some R are junk and some are not

As several have said, it's to do with your mail client and/or how mail
and spam filters are set up on your domain.  Nothing to do with this
list.

1. Read "misfortune of having to use Outlook or even Outlook Express"

The Value section of the relevant help page tells you how the values are 
stored.  If you need more details, reading the appropriate print() method 
will show you where the printed numbers come from (and occasionally they 
are computed in the print method).

For e.g. lm or glm fits coeF(summary(fit)) will extract the 
coefficients matrix.

Had you given an example of what you wanted to extract we could have given 
you an example of how to do it.

Thanks. So there is no solution, other than avoiding fix() and edit()?
What would then be the recommended way to make visible and inspect large 
data.frames (i.e. that are to big for sensibly displaying on the 
console)? Would I need to write the data to a file and open in a 
spreadsheet programme?

Dear John,

The R Workbench (biocep project) comes with a powerful Spreadsheet view
fully connected to an R session. you can use it to do exactly what you
want and it has much more features :

 from within the spreadsheet view you can :
        *import any R Data (numeric, integer, character, logical, complex,
factor, matrix, data frame ) via the toolbar button import from R
(R+arrow towards the spreadsheet)
        *export selected cells to R and assign the content of the cells to
an R variable via the toolbar button export to R (R+arrow towards
R)
         you specify the type of export (numeric, integer, character,
logical, complex, factor, data frame )
         for data frame, you should append to the column name the type of
the column between parathesis ("weight(integer)",
"mesure1(numeric)", "state(factor)", ..)
        * Evaluate an R expression and use the current selection as
argument (the toolbar button R evaluate (R+ruuning man))
         for example you can type "t(%%)" in the R Expression field. This
transposes the selected cells matrix. The result is sent to the
clipboard and you can paste on will
        * type in a cell an expression to evaluate and use any R fucntion,
example in A4 type "=mean(A1:A3)" the content of A4 will be
computed using R fucntion mean and the
         cell value will be the mean of the vector A1:A3. all the R
functions dealing with numeric vectors or matrixes can be used
        * Copy/Paste to and from Excel
        * create as many SpreadSheet Views as needed and specify the
suitable dimensions

on windows and Mac OS, you can use this link to install the R Workbench

Subject: [R] How to extract numbers from ANOVA tables?
In-Reply-To: <9B0B21A0F89B6140AD09698F46BB766B010ACC82@EXCHCL2.uleth.ca>
Message-ID: <6bpls7$51m2um@toip6.srvr.bell.ca>

Dear Lars,

In addition to looking at the relevant help pages, a nice thing about R is
that the objects are there for you to examine. For example:

> mod <- lm(mpg ~ ., data=mtcars)
> av <- anova(mod)

> names(av)
[1] "Df"      "Sum Sq"  "Mean Sq" "F value" "Pr(>F)" 

> str(av)
Classes 'anova' and 'data.frame':       11 obs. of  5 variables:
 $ Df     : int  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 $ Sum Sq : num  817.71  37.59   9.37  16.47  77.48 ...
 $ Mean Sq: num  817.71  37.59   9.37  16.47  77.48 ...
 $ F value: num  116.42   5.35   1.33   2.34  11.03 ...
 $ Pr(>F) : num  5.03e-10 3.09e-02 2.61e-01 1.41e-01 3.24e-03 ...
 - attr(*, "heading")= chr  "Analysis of Variance Table\n" "Response: mpg"

Thus, e.g., av$"Sum Sq" returns the sums of squares:

> av$"Sum Sq"
 [1] 817.7129524  37.5939529   9.3709293  16.4674349  77.4757948   3.9493082
 [7]   0.1297687  14.4742372   0.9717105   0.4066688 147.4944300

You could do the same thing with the object returned by summary().

I hope that this helps,
 John

I think that example says it all. But in simpler form, suppose x is a  
vector, and you want to produce a regular sequence of integers of the  
same length. What should happen i the vector x has length 0? Here's  
the output of the two commands.

x<-numeric(0)
 > y<-length(x)
 > y
[1] 0
 > 1:y

integer(0)

Other than treating the edge case correctly, the only other advantage  
of seq_len, that I am aware of, is that it is faster. Not sure how  
often that ends up mattering though.

Well thank you all, this is solved

Safe domains do not work for lists
News reader solves the problem but at the cost of needing to "go and look"
Univ Wash Computing and Communications was no help

And all you all said "make a filter"
But I could not find custom filters in Mac Entourage

But it was staring me in the face, called Mailing List Manager

Give this Mailing List Manager an list address and voila, no junk from that

See ?View for your new question (and please change the subject line when 
you change the subject: see the R posting guide)

You could also have used e.g. format() on the data frame before calling 
fix() if all you want to do was to view it.

The answer is: it depends.

If you are looking for a single free open source application that covers
all of the formats that StatTransfer supports, then no.

However, many of the formats (at least in terms of being able to read
them) are supported by one or more components within R, either via the
base and recommended packages or via CRAN add-ons. Much of this is
covered in the R Data Import/Export manual.

Perhaps the most notable format that is lacking is the SAS proprietary
format (not the Transport format), which is not openly published and to
my knowledge, has not been independently reverse engineered.

Any of the commercial products that support that format, with the
possible exception of the SAS System Viewer (which is not open source,
but is free from SAS), will be closed source and will have to be
purchased. The non-SAS product vendors will have likely paid a licensing
fee to SAS for the technical details of the format, which they would
need to recover via customers paying for their product. They will also
have likely signed NDA's to prevent them from disclosing the relevant
source code and related materials that describe the format.

If there is specific functionality that you are looking for, let us know
and we can provide more targeted guidance.

HTH,

Marc Schwartz

Dear all,

the possible solutions (non-negative integers) to the following  
constraint partitioning problem:

  X_1+X_2+...+X_(2k)=N
   X_1+X_2<=r_1
   X_3+X_4<=r_2
   X_5+X_6<=r_3
   .....
   X(2k-1)+X(2k)=r_k

  Thank you,

Hi,

   I am trying to find m breakpoints of a linear regression model. I  
used the segmented package. It works fine for small number of  
predicators and breakpoints.(3 r.v. 3 points).  However, my model has  
14 variables it even would not work even for just one breakpoints!.  
The error message is always estimated breakpoints are out of range.
    Since my problem is time related problem. So I hink the  
breakpoints should be all at the same time for all variables. Can I  
achieve this requiement with this package? How?
Thanks
Best Regards
Peter

Here is the code I used and the data is also attached.

reduceddata <- read.table("reduceddata.txt")
  detach()
  attach(reduceddata)
library(segmented)
dat=data.frame(y=V2,x1=V3,x2=V4,x3=V5,
     x4=V6,x5=V7,x6=V8,x7=V9,x8=V10,x9=V11,
     x10=V12,x11=V13,x12=V14,x13=V15,x14=V16,x15=V16)
m=2
psi <- array(0, c(15,m))
for (i in 1:m)
{
psi[1,i]=range(V3)[1]+(i)/(m+1)*(range(V3)[2]-range(V3)[1])
psi[2,i]=range(V4)[1]+(i)/(m+1)*(range(V4)[2]-range(V4)[1])

It was this ... I was asking myself if the Foss movement had
already produced a similar, statistical-software-system
independent , tool.

There is a function in the caret package called postResample that will
do that (even if you aren't using resampling).

As has been previously noted on this list, there are a number of
formulas for R-squared. This function uses the square of the
correlation between the observed and predicted. The next version of
caret will offer a choice of formulas.

The line:

  data. <- c(data., new.data)

will eat both memory and time voraciously.

You should change it by creating 'data.' to
be the final size it will be and then subscript
into it.  If you don't know the final size, then
you can grow it a lot a few times instead of
growing it a little lots of times.

Dear Professor,

I'd like to make a suggestion. 

When I first read some articles ands posts about R's wonderful capabilities,
the first thing I tried to do is import some data to which I had fitted
distributions in Excel, so I could compare the results with R. However,
after reading "R Data Import/Export" and some other references (including
the relevant parts of "Introduction to R"), I still found importing
excruciatingly difficult and frustrating, and I believe that to be true for
many people first approaching R. After a long while I did find the way
around it; however, some time later I came across the R Commander package
and GUI, which makes these simple tasks really simple.

My point is that such unexpected difficulties might deter beginners from
ever considering R again. I believe that including a reference to the R
Commander package in the "R Data Import/Export" document could be a step
forward in this respect. Once the user becomes more familiar with R, they
can spend some more time to learn programmed solutions to data importing.

Best regards.

Why not write one?  The source to that manual is available at

format).  If  you don't know how to handle the format, don't worry:  for 
a small change, you can just treat it like plain text.

If you email me a suggested patch I'll see about updating the manual.

Should have copy-and-pasted this here:

newage <- data.frame( age=seq(10,200,10 ) )

Sorry 'bout the line wraps and bad formatting.

Message-ID: <475B0BBE.2020009@ufl.edu>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1


  I would be grateful if anyone had suggestions
about software that could (1) create 3D surface
plots, (2) handle transparency/alpha blending,
(3) generate output in some vector graphics format
that preserved the transparency.  I could also
live with a combination of two programs, one
to generate the basic figure and another to
modify the output surface to a transparent
color (but preserving vector-ness).

  I've been working with the rgl package, but
can't get the transparency to work for vector
output (rgl.postscript).  The rgl package uses
the gl2ps library -- by default transparency
is disabled in the output (GL2PS_NO_BLENDING
is set), giving reasonable PDF output but
without transparency.  Enabling it in the
source code gives ugly results.

  I ported my graphics to Mathematica, but its
PDF output (and SVG output) are both wonky.

  Any ideas???

Hi all!
 
I am fitting a (mixed) model with a factor (F) and continuous response and predictor:
y~F+F:x
 
(How) can I check the significance of the model at each factor level (i.e. the model could be significant only at one of the levels)?
 
Thank you!

You could consider wireframe from lattice, but this has many caveats.
For an example, see

http://dsarkar.fhcrc.org/lattice/book/figures.html?chapter=06;figure=06_18;theme=stdColor;code=right

For that matter, whats wrong with persp?

  I hadn't thought about the fact that transparency is easier
than it used to be (esp. with cairo device/PDF).
  OK, next question:  is there an easier way than the following
to create a 3D perspective plot with reference grids on some faces?
I  can pull the 3D grid code out of the rgl or scatterplot3d
packages and reimplement it here, I guess ...  another way to
hack this might (?) be to play with tick lengths?

library(cairoDevice)
xgrid = seq(0,1,by=0.1)
ygrid = seq(0,1,by=0.1)
zgrid = seq(0,200,by=20)
zmin = min(zgrid)
zmax = max(zgrid)
ymin = min(ygrid)
ymax = max(ygrid)
xmin = min(xgrid)
xmax = max(xgrid)

p1 = persp(0:1,0:1,matrix(0,ncol=2,nrow=2),axes=FALSE,
     xlab="",ylab="",zlab="",zlim=c(0,200))
invisible(lapply(xgrid,
       function(x) {
         t1 = trans3d(x,ymin,zmin,p1)
         t2 = trans3d(x,ymax,zmin,p1)
         segments(t1$x,t1$y,t2$x,t2$y,col="gray")
       }))
invisible(lapply(ygrid,
       function(y) {
         t1 = trans3d(xmin,y,zmin,p1)
         t2 = trans3d(xmax,y,zmin,p1)
         segments(t1$x,t1$y,t2$x,t2$y,col="gray")
       }))
invisible(lapply(xgrid,
       function(x) {
         t1 = trans3d(x,ymax,zmin,p1)
         t2 = trans3d(x,ymax,zmax,p1)
         segments(t1$x,t1$y,t2$x,t2$y,col="gray")
       }))
invisible(lapply(zgrid,
       function(z) {
         t1 = trans3d(xmin,ymax,z,p1)
         t2 = trans3d(xmax,ymax,z,p1)

Message-ID: <fjfeue$e75$1@ger.gmane.org>

Hi,

what is actually the best method to include R-plots into LaTeX documents?
At the moment i use 

postscript("myplot.eps", width = 12.0, height = 9.0, horizontal = FALSE, 
onefile = TRUE, paper = "special",encoding = "TeXtext.enc")
plot(foo,bar)
dev.off()  

But it is a bit unhandy to scale later and its difficult to get nice 
formula in the plots.

And how should i write formulas on the axis or at specific points? 
Has someone had some effort in exporting plots to pstricks or pictex?

kind regards and thank you for reading so far,

As per the Details section of ?postscript:

The postscript produced for a single R plot is EPS (Encapsulated
PostScript) compatible, and can be included into other documents, e.g.,
into LaTeX, using \includegraphics{<filename>}. For use in this way you
will probably want to set horizontal = FALSE, onefile = FALSE, paper =
"special". Note that the bounding box is for the device region: if you
find the white space around the plot region excessive, reduce the
margins of the figure region via par(mar=).


In your code above, change 'onefile = TRUE' to 'onefile = FALSE'.

For scaling you can use the LaTeX \includegraphics directive along with
several height and width arguments, such as:

  \includegraphics[width=4in]{myplot.eps}
  \includegraphics[height=4in]{myplot.eps}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{myplot.eps}
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{myplot.eps}

You might want to review the following document:

  ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/info/epslatex.pdf 

For including formulae in R plots, see ?plotmath. You can run
example(plotmath) and there are many posts in the r-help archives on
this.

Beyond the above, you may want to look into using SWeave, whereby you
can create entire documents, with nicely formatted tables and plots
directly from R code. More information here:

The SAS proprietary dataset and format catalogue structures were
successfully reverse engineered by a small software firm called
Conceptual and were made available in a product called DBMS/Copy.
DBMS/Copy is/was similar to StatTransfer, but by 2002 was going a lot
further by adding support for much of the SAS data step syntax and some
core SAS procedures as well - in other words, it was rapidly becoming a
very viable and quite good pop person's SAS (with a modest one-off
license fee). However, the SAS Institute bought out the privately-held
Conceptual company, and now sells DBMS/Copy thhrough its wholly-owned
daat integration offshoot company, DataFlux, but without the SAS
datastep support features (to avoid competition with the mainstream SAS
cash cows) - see http://www.conceptual.com/

DBMS/Copy is definitely closed-source and is probably not nearly as
cheapl as it once was when sold by Conceptual. But it is a great product
for convert to or from SAS proprietary data sets and format catalogues,
and works well and quickly with even huge datasets.

I am familiar with DBMS/Copy as my company uses it. Single user Windows
licenses are not too bad (~$500 U.S.), but going beyond that gets
expensive quickly.

I was aware of the past corporate history of Conceptual and it's
transition to DataFlux/SAS, but not that the original developer (who's
name escapes me at the moment) had reverse engineered the SAS format. He
is a SAS employee now, working on other projects and the rumors
percolate out of Tech Support in Cary every now and then that DBMS/Copy
will be EOL'd. There have not been any updates/patches for version 8
since January of this year.

The product is problematic however, in that it will both open and write
SAS datasets that in actuality may not be readable by SAS itself. A
significant problem that caused us to actually have to purchase SAS
earlier this year to be able to validate aspects of a client data
transfer process and we don't use SAS for anything else.

Indeed, there is an inconsistency in the behavior of SAS, DBMS/Copy and
the SAS System Viewer when reading SAS datasets. Given that all three
are now under the purview of SAS, it is in some respects surprising and
in others, not so much.

Unfortunately, SAS is now bundling BASE, STAT and GRAPH as the entry
level offering, so one cannot just get BASE as a stand-alone product any
longer, which is all we needed. This makes the investment even more
expensive for those of us who have to purchase at full commercial
pricing.

Marc

The default when subsetting factors (which happens when you subset a
data frame) is to retain the original set of levels, even if they don't
occur in the resultant subset. This is described in ?"[.factor" where
the 'drop' argument is FALSE by default.

To subset the factor and only retain levels for those values that are
still present, you can use:

  MyFactor <- factor(MyFactor)

or

  MyFactor <- MyFactor[, drop = TRUE]

after subsetting the data frame.

There is also a page in the R Wiki that describes some additional
approaches:

http://wiki.r-project.org/rwiki/doku.php?id=tips:data-manip:drop_unused_levels

running

seems to do the job

Hmm, S'S is numerically singular.  crossprod(S) would be a better way to 
compute it than crossprod(S,S) (it does use a different algorithm), but 
look at the singular values of S, which I suspect will show that S is 
numerically singular.

Looks like the answer is 0.

I tried crossprod(S) but the results were identical. The term
-0.5*log(det(S)) is  a complexity penalty meant to make it unattractive to
include too many components in a finite mixture model. This case was for a
9-component mixture. At least up to 6 components the determinant behaved
as expected and increased with the number of components.

Thanks for your comments.

And the singular values were?

I am not surprised at this: if you have too many components some of them 
may not be contributing to the fit or duplicating others: both lead to 
numerically singular information matrices.  In many mixture-fitting 
problems the log-likelihood is unbounded but with many local maxima: it is 
very easy to find a poor one.

If I understand your doubt is necessary only use a summary command.

Example
set.seed(123)
x<-rnorm(300,sd=2)
F<-sample(rep(letters[1:3],100))
y<-rnorm(300,mean=2,sd=1.5)
model<-lm(y~F+F:x)
summary(model)

(..)
Coefficients:
             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
(Intercept)  2.118128   0.151543  13.977   <2e-16 ***

---
Signif. codes:  0 ?***? 0.001 ?**? 0.01 ?*? 0.05 ?.? 0.1 ? ? 1

In this case only the Intercept is significant

Another possibility is that there is a scaling issue. Linear algebra 
routines are unhappy about having regressors on widely different scales, 
and the squaring of eigenvalues impied by taking crossproducts is no 
help. So what is the diagonal of S'S like? How about svd(S)? (Maybe 
after column normalization)

What you say about mixture models is true in general, however this fit was
the best of 100 random EM starts. Unbounded likelihoods I believe are only
a problem for continuous data mixture models and mine was discrete. Anyway
it's nearly midnight now here so I'd better sleep. Before I go, here are
the singular values:

Hi,

I'm sorry, but I will most likely withdraw R.huge from CRAN anytime
soon.  The File***Matrix classes had some problems, which when solved
made it too slow.  See BufferedMatrix package in Bioconductor instead.

Subject: [R] Getting estimates from survfit.coxph
Message-ID: <b59a37130712090311r67e8ea3bi234396359ff31160@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I'm having difficulty getting access to data generated by survfit and
print.survfit when they are using with a Cox model (survfit.coxph).

I would like to programmatically access the median survival time for
each strata together with the 95% confidence interval. I can get it on
screen, but can't get to it algorithmically. I found myself examining
the source of print.survfit to try to work out how it is done
internally, but is there a better way?

An example (and I realise that estimating survival curses from an
average status and time is incorrect in this instance, but it keeps
this example simple):

test1 <- list(time=  c(4, 3,1,1,2,2,3),
                status=c(1,NA,1,0,1,1,0),
                x=     c(0, 2,1,1,1,0,0),
                sex=   c(0, 0,0,0,1,1,1))
c1 <- coxph( Surv(time, status) ~ x + strata(sex), test1)  #stratified model

f1 <- survfit(c1)
sf1 <- summary(f1)
str(f1)
print(f1)
print(sf1)
str(sf1)

I'm sure I am missing something obvious. Apologies - but any help
greatfully received!

Best wishes,

Mark

P.S. I can get to diferrent estimates for median survival for
different groups using simpler mechanisms, but they yield different
estimates: From my data, so no reproducible (and ataxSurv() is a
wrapper function that calls plain Surv() after manipulating the data

(Disclaimer: there may be a better way got get it with library Design by 
Frank Harrell, but let's assume we have to do it the hard way)

Looks like it is a bit hidden. f1 is of class(print.survfit), as str(f1) 
tells us. So let's try getAnyhwere(print.survfit). In the lower part you 
find line like the following:  

     x1 <- pfun(nsubjects, stime, surv, x$n.risk, x$n.event, 
            x$lower, x$upper)
        if (is.matrix(x1)) {
            if (is.null(x$lower)) 
                dimnames(x1) <- list(NULL, plab)
            else dimnames(x1) <- list(NULL, c(plab, plab2))
        }
        else {
            if (is.null(x$lower)) 
                names(x1) <- plab
            else names(x1) <- c(plab, plab2)
        }
        if (show.rmean) 
            print(x1)
 
Make a copy of that function under a new name, and return x1.

So S is numerically singular: the last 10 or 11 values are effectively 0.
As Peter Dalgaard said, scaling may help but only if the parameters are on 
drastically different scales.

What is very telling about the true nature of the proprietary world, and 
reinforces my belief in open source software, is that the SAS Viewer 
(which works well under wine in Linux) has critical bugs in its csv or 
tab delimited data export just as PROC EXPORT under SAS-proper does.  If 
you have commas or unmatched quotes in a character field (tab for the 
tab delimeter option), the resulting ascii csv file will be broken.  To 
pay that much for SAS and to have such glaring errors that are never 
fixed is amazing.  On a side note I see that OpenOffice can read Word 
2007 documents but Word cannot read any OpenOffice documents.

I have used Stat/Transfer to great success for reading SAS binary files, 
and it runs perfectly under wine on Linux (best luck by creating Stata 
files from it and using the stata.get function in Hmisc (which uses the 
foreign package) to read the result).  I don't have to use Stat/Transfer 
very often but prefer it to DBMS/Copy as it allows more independence 
from the questionable policies of SAS Institute.

Aside from getting confidence limits, the Quantile function in Design 
(Quantile.cph) will create an R function with the analytic 
representation of the quantiles of the fitted survival distribution.

Subject: [R] Obtaining names of further arguments ('...')
Message-ID: <200712091428.18031.ahenningsen@email.uni-kiel.de>

Hi,

I would like to obtain the names of all objects that are provided as further 
arguments ("...") in a function call. I have created a minimal example that 
illustrates my wish (but isn't useful otherwise):

f1 <- function( ... ) return( deparse( substitute( ... ) ) )

x1 <- 1
x2 <- 2
x3 <- 3

f1( x1, x2, x3 )
[1] "x1"

However, I would like to obtain the names of *all* further arguments, 
i.e. "x1", "x2", and "x3".

Is this possible in R? Does anybody know how to do this?

Thanks,
Arne

Those are not the names of the arguments, you passed them as unnamed 
arguments.  They are expressions, and could well be things like

f1( x1 + x3, mean(x2), 3)


> 
> Is this possible in R? Does anybody know how to do this?

Use names(list(...)) to get the names of the arguments.  To get what you 
want, use match.call() to get the call in unevaluated form, and then 
process it.  For example,

f2 <- function( ... ) {
   call <- match.call()
   args <- as.list(call)[-1]
   unlist(lapply(args, deparse))
}

 > f2(x1, x2, x3)
[1] "x1" "x2" "x3"
 > f2( x1 + x3, mean(x2), 3)
[1] "x1 + x3"  "mean(x2)" "3"

If your function has arguments other than ... you'll need a bit more 
work to remove them.  They'll end up as the names of the values in the 
final result.

You program contains:

de.dd<-c("Dresden",51,2,13,44)

and since you are mixing characters with numerics and putting them
into a single vector, the data is coerced to a common data type, which
in this case is numeric.  What are you trying to do?  Do you want to
use a list?

> de.dd
[1] "Dresden" "51"      "2"       "13"      "44"
> de.dd<-list("Dresden",51,2,13,44)
> de.dd
[[1]]
[1] "Dresden"

[[2]]
[1] 51

[[3]]
[1] 2

[[4]]
[1] 13

[[5]]
[1] 44

A list will maintain the mode of each element.

Well, either reduce the size of that kind of text (see "cex.axis" in 
?par) or enlarge the corresponding margins (see "mar" in ?par)

See "col" in ?barplot

See the values barplot() returns and combine them with a call to text().


Can you please read the help pages (and the posting guide) before 
posting? At least two of your questions are directly answered in 
?barplot and the others by a help page ?barplot refers to: ?par.

Hi all

Two questions:
 - I would like to learn more on oriented object programming with R. Is 
there any tutorial for that?
-  Without waking up a troll, I am not very familiar with diffusion 
list, I am more use to forum. On a diffusion list, how can I check if 
someone already asks a question? I mean, I went on CRAN-R website, I 
find the R mailing list archive. But is there a way to search some key 
word like "object programming"?

Thanks for your help

This code produces a graph with a non-decimal x-axis but by far more (human) 
readable because ticks corresponds to months exactly (and not to a weird 
decimal ticking!).
I would like to add a vertical grid with the same criterium.

How can I obtain this?

The usual reference is the book

  _Programming with Data_ (John M. Chambers, Springer, 1998)

I don't know of an online tutorial, but I wouldn't be surprised if one 
exists somewhere.

Within R, RSiteSearch("object programming") will search a collection of 
documentation and mailing list archives.  (You can narrow the search on 
the results page, or by using some of the optional args to RSiteSearch.)

Roger Peng has some objected oriented documentation
at his site as part of a powerpoint presentation.
There is also some discussion at the end of John Fox's CAR book, I think in the appendix. MASS has some also
but I forget the chapter in MASS that focuses on it. 
I think that all three are useful but the level of detail varies in each.

There are two OO models in R called S3 and S4.  S3 is
inspired by the Dylan language and knowing it is essential to using R.
The manuals and possibly some of the contributed documentation (google
for CRAN contributed documentation) will have info on those although I am
not sure whether it will be sufficient.

The CRAN package zoo uses S3 and the CRAN package its uses S4 and they
have roughly
the same purpose so you can use them as examples by downloading their source.
http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/zoo.html
http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/its.html

There are also two addon packages that support different OO models.  The proto
package supports the prototype model (also known as the object-based model)
and is inspired by the Self programming language.  The R.oo package supports
a more conventional model similar to that in most other mainstream languages.
The home pages of these two packages are given in their CRAN descriptions:
http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/R.oo.html
http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/proto.html

You can use the RSiteSearch function from within R to search the
r-help archives and documentation.
or you can browse r-help and r-devel archives here or via gmane or nabble
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel
Googling with r-help, r-devel or r-project.org or even just R as one
of the words will often
locate material.

The website is http://www.spatstat.org (seems to be down for me, but 
that's probably me); the maintainers also read this list.

Don't use read.shape(), it returns a raw object that is difficult to 
handle. An example with readShapePoly:

library(maptools)
library(spatstat)
xx <- readShapePoly(system.file("shapes/sids.shp", package="maptools")[1])
.spatstat_check <- FALSE
NC <- as(as(xx, "SpatialPolygons"), "owin")
plot(NC)
class(NC)
pts <- runifpoint(1000, NC)
plot(pts, pch=16, cex=0.5, add=TRUE)

The .spatstat_check is to turn off topology checking - please use only 
when necessary. In general the internal structures expect polygons not to 
touch or intersect, but the North Carolina counties do touch, so I have 
turned off the check.

There are more notes on Dylan Beaudette's site at:

http://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/drupal/node/319

Hope this helps,

Roger

- You don't need a panel function since there is only one.
- There should not be more than 2 components on lty and lwd
since tab has two columns and that is the cause of the
warning message you are seeing.
- with the recent version of zoo plot.type uses screen so
you can write the shorter screen = 1 instead of the lengthier
plot.type = "single"

Redone with an abline at the end to give the grid lines gives:

plot(tab, screen = 1, lty = c(1,2), lwd = c(8,2),
	col = c("darkorange", "red2"),
	xlab = " ", ylab = "euro/MWh", xaxt = "n")

fmt <- "%b-%Y" # format for axis labels
axis(1, at = time(tab), lab = FALSE)
ix <- seq(1, length(tab), 3)
labs <- format(time(tab), fmt)
axis(1, at = time(tab)[ix], lab = labs[ix], tcl = -0.7, cex.axis = 0.9)
abline(v = time(tab)[ix], lty = 2, col = "grey")

The essence of this feature is to get the correct index sequences when 
performing matrix lookups and loops without causing errors in the 
matrices or subscripts. If I build the correct x=seq_len or 
x=seq(along=) and use the 'in x' not 'in 1:dim(x)[1]' or 'in 
1:length(x)', my code will execute correctly without the NA/NAN error or 
subscript out of bounds, etc.  Is this correct?

Examples
 > x=numeric()
 > x
numeric(0)
 > for ( i in 1:x) print(i)
Error in 1:x : NA/NaN argument
 > for ( i in x) print(i)
 > x=2
 > for ( i in x) print(i)
[1] 2
 > seq_len(x)
[1] 1 2
 > x=seq_len(x)
 > for ( i in x) print(i)
[1] 1
[1] 2
 > for ( i in 1:x) print(i)
[1] 1
Warning message:

Subject: [R] Adding info from summary(lm(...)) to plot
Message-ID: <XFMail.071209191512.Ted.Harding@manchester.ac.uk>

Hi Folks,

Say I have 2 continuous variables X,Y.

I can of course plot (X,Y) with

  plot(X,Y,pch="+",col="blue")

say, and add the regression line from lm(Y~X)
by extracting the coefficients 'a' of Intercept
and 'b' of X from Y.lm <- lm(Y~X).

Now, however, I want to have not only a general
explanatory title such as

  main="Plot of Y against X"

but also (and ideally just under the main title
and above the figure region of the plot) the
result of

  round(summary(Y.lm)[[4]],digits=3)

exactly as shown below:

            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept)   78.636      0.273 287.902    0.000
X             -0.074      0.029  -2.527    0.012

It would also be OK to have it as a "subtitle"
below the xlabel (which by default is X" in this case).

I've been trying to work out how to so this simply,
but without much success. I can see a complicated
way, which involves binding the row and column names,
and the values, of the above output, using paste()
along with "\n" at suitable places, but I'd like to
have something much less intricate than that!

I'd also like to be able to integrate the solution
nicely with the main title (or the X label) so that
there's no overlap.

Any suggestions?

with thanks,
Ted.

Maura,

What operating system are you on?  If you are on Windows, you will want
the "compiled" version of the package, which is the .zip file.  The .tgz
archive is a "source" version of the package, which can be used for
example, under Linux.

In either case, you DO NOT want to extract the archive to it's
constituent components. You want to directly install the archive file.

If on Windows, you should use something like:

  install.packages("PathTo/growth.zip")

or install directly from Jim's web site:

 install.packages("http://popgen.unimaas.nl/~jlindsey/rcode/growth.zip")

Similary, if you are on Linux, you can use the same commands, just
replace the .zip with .tgz.  However, you will need 'root' access to do
this, unless you are installing to a local library tree.

This is covered in the R manuals and in the R FAQs.

HTH,

Marc Schwartz

Ted, 

For plotting the fitted regression line, you can use:

  abline(ModelObject)

rather than extracting the coefs, etc.

See ?abline for more information.  There are also examples
in ?predict.lm using matplot()/matlines() for adding the
confidence/prediction intervals.

In terms of adding the model summary table, you might want to consider
doing this within a legend box using a monospace font. There was a
thread on this a couple of years back on r-help:

  http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/R/Rhelp02a/archive/58410.html

You may wish to review the full thread to get a sense for the evolution
of the solutions posed.

HTH,

Marc Schwartz

Your parentheses don't match on the rG line.  You have 3 lefts and 2 rights.

Subject: [R] Lmer output for negative binomial data
Message-ID: <066701c83aa9$953df9d0$0d01a8c0@Amazone>

Dear R-list,
May I ask for help in interpretating the output of 'lmer' (from the lme4 
package) when dealing with negative binomial data ?

I'm using the functions glm.nb (from the MASS package) and lmer (from the 
lme4) to fit respectively fixed-effects and mixed-effects generalized linear 
models to data, generated from a negative binomial distribution : count ~ 
Neg.Bin (mu, theta). Here is the code:
==============================================================================
#Generate the data frame
set.seed(2153)
mydf<-data.frame(subjs=seq(1:nsubjids),
counts=rnbinom(nsubjids*ntimes, size=0.5, mu=1.8))

#Model
require(MASS); require(lme4)
summary(glm.nb(counts~1, data=mydf))
summary(lmer(counts~1+(1|subjs), 
family=negative.binomial(theta=fixed.nb0$theta), data=mydf))
==============================================================================
The glm.nb output gives : mu=exp(0.5306) and theta=0.513.
I use the theta estimate from glm.nb as input into lmer, and I obtain, 
mu=exp(0.5306).

The output from lmer gives the following for the Random effects:
Random effects:
 Groups   Name        Variance   Std.Dev.
 subjs    (Intercept) 3.5577e-10 1.8862e-05
 Residual             7.1155e-01 8.4353e-01
number of obs: 30, groups: subjs, 10

I interprete the "subjs" component as an individual error term "e" (so, that 
mu=exp(0.5306)*exp(e)) with e~N(0, 3.5577e-10) ? Is this correct ?
What about the 'Residual' term ?

Thanks for your help,
Best regards,
Fran?ois

Subject: [R] Saving lattice plot as a PDF
Message-ID: <335995.83858.qm@web34707.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi there,

    I need to save a series of lattice plots as a PDF,
this is my code so far:

windows(height=8,width=6)
plot.new()
library('grid')
lattice.options(layout.heights=list(top.padding=list(x=0.15,
units="inches")))
print(plot1, split=c(1,1,2,3), more=TRUE)
print(plot2, split=c(1,2,2,3), more=TRUE)
print(plot3, split=c(1,3,2,3), more=TRUE)
print(plot4, split=c(2,1,2,3), more=TRUE)
print(plot5, split=c(2,2,2,3), more=TRUE)
print(plot6, split=c(2,3,2,3), more=FALSE)

ltext(grid.locator(), label='text', cex=1.3)
ltext(grid.locator(), label='text', cex=1.3)

And when I open the PDF created I see "text" at the
bottom of may layout, even though I placed it at the
top of the sheet.. If I save it as a metafile of PNG
the layoout is correct.

I have tried trellis.devices, what do I need to do to
retain the laout properties in a PDF format?

Thank you,

Judith

Initializing Cairo stops the whole HTTP response. Apache logs show

Something like this will probably be close enough:

main="This is my really long title and it's so long that I can see\njust about half of it."

I suspect the ``native'' coordinate system (which is all ltext() will
know about) is different for PDF. The following might work as
alternative for the ltext calls.

grid.text(label = "text",
          cex = 1.3,
          vp = do.call(viewport, grid.locator(unit="npc")))

Rina,
   Alternatively, you could avoid the entire double loop by using 
matrix operations.  I show this and then reproduce it using the first 
section of your code:

#how to use matrices to avoid looping
n_trait <- 5
X <- matrix( rnorm(100*n_trait),ncol= n_trait) #create a data matrix
G_o <- t(X) %*% X   #create the G_o matrix as a  matrix of cross products
G_o          #show the cross products

dG <- diag(1/sqrt(diag(G_o)))  #divide by the sqrt of the diagonal
rG <- dG %*% G_o %*% dG
rG                              #show the result
#######################
  #abbreviated Rina code using loops
  for(i in 1:n_trait){
     for( j in 1:n_trait){
  rG[i,j] <- G_o[i,j]/(sqrt(G_o[i,i]%*%G_o[j,j])) }}
rG         #compare to above

Subject: [R] lattice: placing y-axis labels on right-hand side of panel when
	relation="sliced"
Message-ID: <fji1d6$igp$1@ger.gmane.org>


Hello,

        I'm using lattice to create a multi-panel figure.  I would like
to draw each panel's y-axis ticks and labels on the right-hand
side of the panel.  Ordinarily, I would do this by specifying
scales=list(y=list(draw=T, alternating=2)).  But in this case, I am
using relation="sliced" to determine the y-axis limits.  So
"alternating" is ignored.  Is there any way -- short of using grid
functions -- to place the y-axis ticks and labels on the right-hand
sides of these panels?

        I checked the R Graph Gallery and the figures to Deepayan's
new book but saw nothing that would help.  I'm using R 2.5.0 and
lattice 0.16-1 on Windows XP.

Thank you,
--John

Hi Deepayan and everyone,

   I need to add a common legend to a group of latice
graphs, I have tried different ways using viewport and
grid.draw without success.

Here is what I have:

plot.new()

library(grid)
library('IDPmisc')

print(plot1, split=c(1,1,2,4), more=TRUE)
print(plot4, split=c(2,1,2,4), more=TRUE)
print(plot2, split=c(1,2,2,4), more=TRUE)
print(plot5, split=c(2,2,2,4), more=TRUE)
print(plot3, split=c(1,3,2,4), more=TRUE)
print(plot6, split=c(1,4,1,4), more=FALSE)
grid.text(vp=do.call(viewport,grid.locator(unit="npc")),
label='A', gp=gpar(fontsize=20))
grid.text(vp=do.call(viewport,grid.locator(unit="npc")),
label='B', gp=gpar(fontsize=20))





key1<-draw.leg(key=list(text=list(c('some text',
'text2')),points=list(pch=c(17,15))))
vp.key<-viewport(grid.locator(unit="npc"))
pushViewport(vp.key)
grid.draw(key1)

grid.locator cannot be one of the arguments of
viewport, but waht would be the analog of this
argument in viewport then?

Thank you,

Judith

Hi, There are two unanswered reports of this error (below) in read.spss() 
when used with a .por file. I had the same problem and in order to 
successfully read the file into R I downloaded spss, saved the data as 
.dat tab-delimited, and then used read.table(). The point is that spss 
successfully read the same .por data file (the Polity II data freely 
available from ICPSR) that R couldn't read. So, I assume this is a bug in 
R.

Try looking at the first example in

for inspiration.

Subject: [R]  Having trouble getting GARCH parameters (basic/newbie)
Message-ID: <14247536.post@talk.nabble.com>


I'm having no luck getting GARCH parameter estimations.  It seems simple
enough, but I don't know what I'm doing.  I'm a newbie both at R and GARCH
models, so whatever is going wrong, it's probably very basic.  Here's what I
do:

1. I first load the tseries package with:

   library("tseries")

2. I then load the data with:

   g <- read.table("test.csv", header=T)
  
3. It appears to work because I can print the data (a "hello world" type
dataset with only 5 datapoints):

   > g
         Data
   1 0.002337
   2 0.010037
   3 0.007608
   4 0.005620
   5 0.006050

4. Looks good.  So now I try to get the parameters of a fitted GARCH(1,1)
model:

   > gFit <- garch( g, order=c(1,1) )

Here's where the problem is.  R returns:

   ***** ESTIMATION WITH ANALYTICAL GRADIENT ***** 

and that's it.  No further output is generated; R just sits there.   My
dataset had 5000 elements, but R just hung there after printing the above
message.   So I cut the dataset down to 100 elements, and then down to just
5 elements.

I'm pretty sure 5 elements should be a snap for R; I think the estimation
would be done in seconds, so something is definitely wrong.

Help?

Dear all, 
I am encountering a cyclic dependency error when running R CMD check on an R package I wrote (R version 2.6.1, Mac OS X 10.4), see the error message below.    

Creating a new generic function for "print" in "clValid"
Creating a new generic function for "summary" in "clValid"
Creating a new generic function for "plot" in "clValid"
Error in loadNamespace(package, c(which.lib.loc, lib.loc), keep.source = keep.source) : 
        cyclic name space dependencies are not supported
Error : package/namespace load failed for 'clValid'
Error: unable to load R code in package 'clValid'
Execution halted
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package 'clValid'
** Removing '/Users/guybrock/Documents/projects/DattaPackages/Cluster/clValid_0.5-4.Rcheck/clValid'


The NAMESPACE file is below,

.onLoad <- function(lib, pkg) require(methods)
importFrom(graphics, plot)
exportClasses(clValid)
exportMethods(clusters, clusterMethods, nClusters, measNames, measures, optimalScores, plot, print, show, summary)
S3method(print,sota)
S3method(plot,sota)
export(clValid, sota, dunn, connectivity, BHI, BSI, stability, matchGO)

My question is - how can I locate the source of the cyclic dependency error?  This is an updated version of a package which did not previously have this error, so somehow I introduced this in the modifications I made.  Note that R CMD check on Windows (R version 2.6.0) doesn't catch this, although R CMD build --binary fails on Windows with the same error.   

Thanks,
Guy

Thanks Chuck, that works nicely.

You are probably using Windows: you didn't say.  If so, this is a known 
bug in the tseries package: it uses Fortran I/O and that fails in Rgui. 
The fix (until the package is updated) is to use Rterm instead.

Dear helper,

After some cleaning, I found out that I cannot open my R2.6.0 console
with message: "Fatal error: uanble to retore saved data in .Rdata",
and every time I retry it just kick me off. I am wondering if I still
be able to retrieve the data that I've been working for a month.

I have installed the new R2.6.1 and it has no problem to open, only
there is nothing in it I also wonder if I will be able to transfer all
the files in 2.6.0 to 2.6.1. I appreciate anyone who can help.

Thank you,
Ilham

Hi Monica,

I downloaded growth.tgz and rmutil.tgz (which growth requires) and 
installed them like this:

R CMD INSTALL rmutil.tgz --no-latex
R CMD INSTALL growth.tgz --no-latex

The examples seem to work, so maybe this would work for you.

Subject: [R] how to let R read different equations I write and execute it?
Message-ID: <14243817.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello All,
I am a newcomer to R. Currently, I am trying to write an interactive code in
R to let it read the equation which I write and execute the equation in a
curve function.

For example: I want to plot curve by using: curve (equation, -2,2, n=1000)
what I want is that the R code ask me what equation I want to use (which I
know how to write this code):
then, I type for example 3*x.

then 3*x will be assigned to the 'equation' (I don't know how to do this
step)
then curve function will work to plot.

but I dont' know how I can let the equation to be read in and assigned to
equation.
I know how to do this kind of thing for numerical values but not for logical
equations.

Anyone can help out?

thanks a lot!
czqiu

probably you're looking for str(), e.g.,

str(lis)


I hope it helps.

Hi Chris, This is a very rough first conceptual program you could use -- 
double check all the syntax as I know it won't work at first go. It's 
untested but can be jiggered to work! Good luck! Anders

Use unique() to get your unique combinations, then loop or vectorize 
through each unique combination to count the combos.

unique(data)->x
thirdcol<-NULL
for(i in 1:dim(data)[1]){
 	for(k in 1:dim(x)[1]{
 	thirdcol<-cbind(thirdcol,dim(data[data[i,] %in% x[k,]])[1])
}}

newdata<-cbind(data,thirdcol)

Subject: [R] moving average and NA values
Message-ID: <d80a8b750712100345v3a5e7b02x5801dd1e4fe1c683@mail.gmail.com>

The S-plus function moving.ave(data, span = 2) calculates the moving
average, but it does not have an argument to tell it how to deal with
NA values, so it will return NA for all averages as shown below.

Is there an R or S moving average function which is able to omit some
NA values in the dataset?

In the simple sample shown below it would be possible to just remove
the rows with NA values. The dataset on which I want to use the moving
average function with a span of 270 is a time series dataset, just
removing rows would corrupt this dataset and make it unfit to plot.

t <- (1:10)
moving.ave(t,2)

You should describe your problem a bit more clearly, best by giving a sample
set, and how the result should look like. With a bit of guesswork, the 
following might come close to what you want :

t.test(rnorm(100,0.21))

rnorm() generates the test vector, put your data there instead.

Ok, outlook may not be that great, but even in outlook you can create a
separate folder called "R" and create a rule so all email with "[R]" or
"[Rdevel]" etc. going into the R folder.  That way you can easily scan
your R mail separate from your regular mail and then delete everything
you don't need.  That's what I do on my work PC.

I find it absolutely essential to have a client that can display mail in
threads.  Deleting mail a thread at a time is an order of magnitude more
efficient.  Nabble does a fairly good job of showing threads, but I
would prefer to download every message and delete the threads I'm
ignoring.  Even on a good connexion, the delays downloading individual
messages add up.  And gmail is slower still.  Another advantage of your
own client is that you can use a monospaced font which is far easier for
reading code which is bound to happen on a list like this.

Most people I know have the misfortune of not having access to a mail
client that displays threads[1], but for anyone who has control over
such things, in the Windows world, I know Thunderbird is fairly good,
but if you're fortunate enough to be allowed to use Linux, there is Mutt
or you might like Emacs as a mail client which both do threads very well
without the need to use a mouse -- which I consider a huge bonus.

[....]


|> 
|> Still would be fun to understand why some R are junk and some are not

As several have said, it's to do with your mail client and/or how mail
and spam filters are set up on your domain.  Nothing to do with this
list.

Subject: [R] Extracting clusters from Data Frame
Message-ID: <fjjet2$6k3$1@ger.gmane.org>

Hello,

I have a large data frame (1006222 rows), which I subject to a crude
clustering attempt that results in a vector stating whether the datapoint
represented by a row belongs to a cluster or not. Conceptually this looks
something like this:
Value   Cluster?
0.01    FALSE
0.03    TRUE
0.04    TRUE
0.05    TRUE
0.07    FALSE
...
What I'm looking for is an efficient strategy to extract all consecutive
rows associated with "TRUE" as a single cluster (data.frame
representation?) without cluttering memory with thousends of data.frames.
I was thinking of an independent data.frame that would contain a column of
lists that reference all indexes from the big one which are contained in
one cluster ...
Can anyone kindly nudge me and let me know how to deal with this
efficiently?

Joh

Seriously, it all depends on what you consider "basic stats".
(Especially the level of math prerequisites varies widely among new R
users.)

You might also want to check out the lists at

http://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html
http://www.r-project.org/other-docs.html

(I kind of like the short document by Owen, but it  does assume that 
you are not scared by a few sums and integrals.)

How about :
orig.data<-sample(c(TRUE,FALSE),100,replace=T)
Cluster<-data.frame(c.ndx=cumsum(rle(orig.data)$lengths),c.size=rle(orig.data)$lengths,c.type=rle(orig.data)$values)
Cluster<-Cluster[Cluster$c.type==TRUE,]

##Then, to get all original data belonging to cluster three:
orig.data[rev(Cluster[3,"c.ndx"]-seq(length.out=Cluster[3,"c.size"])+1)]


Not the neatest solution, but I'm sure someone here can improve on it.

It is evident that you do not have enough information in the data to
estimate 9 mixture components.  This is clearly indicated by a positive
semi-definite information matrix, S, that is less than full rank.  You can
monitor the rank of the information matrix, as you increase the number of
components, and stop when you suspect rank-deficiency.

I tried crossprod(S) but the results were identical. The term
-0.5*log(det(S)) is  a complexity penalty meant to make it unattractive to
include too many components in a finite mixture model. This case was for a
9-component mixture. At least up to 6 components the determinant behaved
as expected and increased with the number of components.

Thanks for your comments.

form2<-parse(text=form)
foo <- function(x){}
body(foo) <- form2

split the data frame, cbind the count and unsplit back:

 DF <- data.frame(A = c("A", "A", "A", "B", "C"), B = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 0))

See ?split where there is a very similar example.

Subject: [R] Building R on Sun Solaris 10 (SPARC) using Sun Studio 12
Message-ID: <475D64DE.90302@msu.edu>

R Help List:

Just curious if anyone has successfully built R on a SPARC
platform running Sun Solaris 10 using the latest Sun Studio
12 set of compilers.   If so, I would be interested in the
compile flags that you used.

I have tried several different builds of version 2.5.1, 2.6.0,
and 2.6.1 using various different compile flags and I am able
to compile and check, but for whatever reason, the "foreign"
package crashes whenever it is loaded.   I need the "foreign"
package in order to install the "maptools" package.   This is
the error that I am getting when attempting to load "foreign":

I have been messing with the "xmemalign" flag, but doesn't seem to have much
of an impact.   I am curious if there may be a simple compile flag in Sun
Studio 12 that can be set to fix this problem.


At any rate, if anyone has been able to successfully build on Sun Solaris 10
(SPARC) using Sun Studio 12 and the "foreign" package loads without 
crashing,
I would be most appreciative if you could let me take a look at your 
".configure"
options.  


NOTE: So far, the only package that I am having trouble with is 
"foreign".   Everything
else seems to build and check ok.  In fact, when "foreign" is built, 
there are no errors
reported during the compile.   Also, I have tried 
"install.packages("foreign") from
within R to upgrade to the latest version of "foreign".  It compiles and 
installs, but
once again, it crashes when R attempts to use it producing the 
"segfault" error.


Any help would be most welcome.


Thanks.

You might want to have a look at the qcc package. See

Given the lenght of the names you may have a problem. 
?mtext is the obvious way but the names are too long. 
Have a look at
http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/R/Rhelp02a/archive/80007.html
for rotating the labels or use the staxlab function in
plotrix (see below)

library(plotrix)
bp <- barplot(x$Percent, space=0,
names.arg=x$ReasonCode, main="Pareto",
 legend.text=x$ReasonCode, ylab="% error", col=1:5,
ylim=c(0,50), xaxt="n")
 staxlab(side=1, 1:6, x[,3])

Subject: [R] Sweave : change value in rnw file to generate multiple "single"
 reports ?
Message-ID: <14256204.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello,

I'm still trying to make the life of my colleagues easier. Nice, isn't it ?
At the moment, I'm looking for a way to generate multiple "single report".
In fact I have a .rnw file which send a query to a MySQL database
(rs<-dbSendQuery(con, statement="select * from treatdata where
name='Device1'")

But of course my colleagues have many devices and don't want to enter the
rnw file to change the name of the device.

Is there a way to pass arguments to Sweave like Sweave("myfile.rnw",
namevar="Device2") and it will change namevar by Device2 into the file
myfile.rnw before creating the .tex file ?
Or is it possible to do it via another language, that is: loading the rnw
file, modifying it, saving it and finally calling Sweave ?

Whatever the solution, I need you help. In advance thank you.
Ptit Bleu.

Could anyone recommend a package for visualizing a likelihood function
of two scalar parameters? I would prefer a three-dimensional plot
similar to the kind Mathematica is known for, perhaps generated by a
package not specific to likelihood.

I don't think you can access Ch 12 code from that (those plots are by
nature not scriptable, and I haven't done the extra work to make the
code available anyway).

The ability to pass arguments on the

R CMD Sweave

line is something I would very much like to have as well.

Currently you need to create a shell or batch file that accepts
the arguments, place those into environment variables using shell
or batch code and then run sweave.  R code in your swevae file
would then read the environment variables using Sys.getenv.

Not as far as I know, but you could wrap Sweave() in another function 
that uses save() to write a file of variables, and start your .Rnw file 
with load("file.Rdata").

Surely yes, there are lots of ways to automatically edit a text file.

Within or before SWeave, you can use R.
Hence you can write some R function that first changes the rnw and runs 
SWeave thereafter, or even better, write something in your SWeave code 
that reads a user customized variables, e.g. from an environment 
variable or from some text file.

You can set an environment variable in the system (SET DELTA=...), and read it
in from R:

Sys.getenv("DELTA") 

Works for Windows with a rather inconsistent implementation of environment
strings, so it should work the better with Linux.

The basic strategy is to calculate a matrix of values of the likelihood, 
corresponding to all combinations of values of two vectors.  Then 
persp()  (in graphics) or persp3d() (in rgl) can display the surface.

I don't know of anything that corresponds to curve() to do the matrix 
calculations automatically, but it may well exist.

I think something like this would work.

Change your query to 

rs <- dbSendQuery(con, statement = paste("select * from treatdata where
name='", whichDevice,"'", sep = ""))

And then create a script like.

whichDevice <- "Device1"
Sweave("myfile.rnw")
whichDevice <- "Device2"
Sweave("myfile.rnw")

HTH,

Hello,

I'm still trying to make the life of my colleagues easier. Nice, isn't
it ?
At the moment, I'm looking for a way to generate multiple "single

In fact I have a .rnw file which send a query to a MySQL database

But of course my colleagues have many devices and don't want to enter

Is there a way to pass arguments to Sweave like Sweave("myfile.rnw",

myfile.rnw before creating the .tex file ?
Or is it possible to do it via another language, that is: loading the

Whatever the solution, I need you help. In advance thank you.

Well, 


I think de package tree solve your problem. If your response variable
don't use logistic approach if your variable is numeric use standard
formula

Any doubt read :

Hi TLowe,

I'm not quite sure if I understand what you are trying to do.  If you 
are trying to get the cumulative sum of your data frame along each 
column you can simply do

rcumsum=function(x){cumsum(x)/sum(x)}
apply(tdat,2,rcumsum)

Yet that is not what your code is doing.  With a bit of clarification I 
may help you some more.

Julian

Yes, I had forgotten that works.  I usually use R CMD Sweave, where (as 
Gabor mentioned) it's harder to set variables.

Note that while the Thierry's idea is quite good it since it avoids the use
of shell or batch files it still does have the disadvantage of requiring an
extra file in the case where the report is being spawned from some other
system such as a web application written in php as it requires both a
.R file and a .Rnw file.

On the other hand if R CMD Sweave accepted arguments one could do it all
in the Sweave file and avoid the extra complexity of an intermediate .R or
shell/batch file in the first place.

Subject: [R] Question re: RWinEdt conflicting with my WinEdt
Message-ID: <475D8F62.1090008@stat.berkeley.edu>

Hi,

This is a question regarding the RWinEdt package for R. I have WinEdt 
5.5, RWinEdt 1.7-9, and R 2.6.0 on WindowsXP.

Somehow my configuration or start up files between RWinEdt and WinEdt 
are getting confused. Usually when I open either one, the last files I 
was working on *with that program* are opened automatically. So if I 
last used mydoc.tex in WinEdt and myprogram.R in RWinEdt those would 
open in the appropriate programs and there was no mixing up of the file 
lists between the two. But in the last month or so (and I don't think 
I've updated anything) whatever files I was last working with on either 
one show up. So if close WinEdt and then open RWinEdt, mydoc.tex shows 
up instead of myprogram.R, and vice versa. I assume some kind of 
initialization files have been moved or deleted, so they are borrowing 
from each other, but I don't know how to fix this and it's quite 
annoying. This is the case whether I start RWinEdt within R, or from a 
shortcut on my desktop with no interface with R.

Thanks for any help,
Elizabeth Purdom

WinEdt's default is:
Start with WinEdt.ini initialization file and that again uses WinEdt.prj 
as the default for loading your .tex files, for example.

Using RWinEdt, R.ini is used as the initialization file and that one 
uses R.prj as the default for loading your .R files.

If that does not work as before, you have changed something. Just take a 
look whether the settings are correct in both instances of WinEdt.

note that load() returns, invisibly, a string with the names of the 
objects that were loaded. something in the lines of:

myObj <- load(file.path(fnDir, cvListFiles[i]))
myFunction(get(myObj))
rm(list=myObj)

might be closer to what you want.

moreover, if length(myObj) > 1, you might want sth like:

lapply(myObj, function(x) myFunction(get(x)))

instead...

You can load() each to a new enviroment: see the arguments of load().

Have you tried vectorizing the inner function? 
Hint: integrate() calls the integrand vectorwise... 
in your example,
      integrate(Vectorize(f),lower=1,upper=2)
should do what you expected.

Peter

Hello Uwe, Thanks for your reply. I realized in RWinEdt that it was 
linking to another project that I had made in WinEdt -- I didn't realize 
I could create or change projects within RWinEdt, so I don't know how I 
managed that! But now that I do know, that is also very convenient. So I 
think it's solved, or at least if it reoccurs I can work around it.
Thanks,
Elizabeth

What you say is likely to be true, but I was interested to see if this was
reflected in some of the traditional model selection criteria (AIC, BIC,
...). In this case numerical problems caused by overfitting prevent the
calculation of a diagnostic measure for overfitting. Incidentally here
other measures of overfitting that I was able to calculate continue to
indicate underfitting. Of course in the mixture model case these measures
are heuristic only as the assumptions behind their asymptotic
justification are not valid.

Dear R friends-
 
I'm attempting to generate a regression tree with one gradient predictor and multiple responses, trying to test if change in size (turtle.data$Clength) acts as a single predictor of ten multiple diet taxa abundances (prey.data)  Neither rpart or mvpart seem to allow me to do multiple responses.  (Or if they can, I'm not using the functions properly.)

> library(rpart)
> turtle.rtree<-rpart(prey.data~., data=turtle.data$Clength, method="anova", maxsurrogate=0, minsplit=8, minbucket=4, xval=10); plot(turtle.rtree); text(turtle.rtree)
Error in terms.formula(formula, data = data) : 
        '.' in formula and no 'data' argument

When I switch response for predictor, it works.  But this is the opposite of what I wanted to test and gives me splits at abundance values, not carapace length values.

I've heard polymars recommended for this sort of situation.  I've downloaded the polyspline library, but get bogged down in the equation.  Also, it doesn't seem like polymars will generate a tree even if I do get it working.  Can rpart be modified in some way to accomodate multiple response parameters?  If anyone's ever come across this situation before, pointers would be much appreciated.  Thanks.

Subject: [R] Problem with graphics device in Mac OS X
Message-ID: <a1174a3d23.a3d23a1174@osu.edu>

Hello List,
   I am teaching a basic course where students are encouraged to use R. There are a few students using Mac OS X. As a test we downloaded and installed the latest .dmg file (R-2.6.1.dmg) onto a intel Mac running 10.5.1. A device query yields

> getOption("device")
"quartz"

But any plot command does not bring up a plot (e.g. plot(), boxplot(), hist()).

I found a thread concerning X11 windows under Mac OS X but I feel these users will most likely be just using the native quartz device.

Invoking a call to quartz() first does not seem to help, e.g.

>quartz()
>plot(rnorm(100,0,1))

produces no output and no error message (Nothing happens). A call to dev.cur() seems to indicate a device is active.
>quartz()
>dev.cur()
quartz
2

but again a plot command produces no figure. Sorry am I not a Mac OS user and I did check the archives but found mostly discussions on X11() under Mac OS X.

Message-ID: <bebd16360712101242g276a7c9dy2e2c57a224ad972@mail.gmail.com>

Dear helper,

After some cleaning, I found out that I cannot open my R2.6.0 console
with message: "Fatal error: unable to restore saved data in .Rdata",
and every time I retry it just kick me off. I am wondering if I still
be able to retrieve the data that I've been working for a month.

I have installed the new R2.6.1 and it has no problem to open, only
there is nothing in it I also wonder if I will be able to transfer all
the files in 2.6.0 to 2.6.1. I appreciate anyone who can help.

Thank you,
Ilham

For whatever reason, on the Mac, you have to open a new Quartz device window
before making the graphics call.  So, from the menu, pull down under Window
to New Quartz Device Window.  Then all graphics calls go to that (initially
empty) window, and any further calls replace the previous contents of the
window.  This window doesn't print so well, but your students can divert
their output to a pdf easily for really nice plots.

BTW, people were reporting problems with OS 10.5 and R.  These may have been
fixed, but if you have trouble, it's discussed in the archives.

I think you should post this to R-Sig-Mac.
I don't notice any problem at all on my system with the same

Subject: [R] Sweave : change value in rnw file to generate multiple
 "single" reports ?
In-Reply-To: <14256204.post@talk.nabble.com>
References: <14256204.post@talk.nabble.com>
Message-ID: <07E228A5BE53C24CAD490193A7381BBBD627E0@LP-EXCHVS07.CO.IHC.COM>

Others have given some good advice, and what works best for you will
depend on exactly what you want to do and how you think about the
problem.  Here are just a couple of other ideas to throw into the mix.

If you want to edit the .rnw file, then the tools sed, awk, or perl (or
probably several others) can all do this quite easily.  For example if
you have a file (base.rnw) that has MYDEVICE everywhere that you want to
replace with Device2 or whatever then the following command at a command
prompt will create a new file (dev2.rnw) that is a copy of base.rnw with
all occurences of MYDEVICE replaced with Device2:

 perl -pe "s/MYDEVICE/Device2/g" base.rnw > dev2.rnw

Another tool that you may want to learn is "make".  You can set up a
makefile that shows how each file relates to the next in a chain of
steps, then just type something like:

 make device2.pdf

At the command line and it will automatically make the changes to your
.rnw file and possibly to data or other files involved, then run all the
steps needed to create device2.pdf, then deletes all the intermediate
files that you don't need (device2.dvi, ...).  It also has the benefit
of being able to update all the appropriate files when you update a data
file, script file, or .rnw file.

Hope this helps,

Subject: [R] 00LOCK error with site-library
Message-ID: <475DB2F8.1000108@gmail.com>

I have identical R.profiles and R_HOME directories set up on both my 
local machine and a remote linux cluster. To keep my libraries and R 
install separate, I use a site-library on both machines.

The first line of my .Rprofile is:
'.libPaths(new= "~/R_HOME/site-library") #tell R where site-library is'

Until R-2.6.0 this was working fine on both machines, but since I have 
been unable to upgrade packages on the remote machine. Every attempt at 
upgrade results in a directory '00LOCK' being place in the 
site-directory and then the upgrade fails.

This has happened with R-2.6.0, 2.6.1, and now with R-devel (2.7.0).

If I have this setup incorrectly I am puzzled as to why it works with my 
local machine and why it worked with versions of R prior to 2.6.0.

Ideas?
Thanks,
Mark

You need to change your CRAN mirror.  Apparently hostingzero.com is not 
responding.  Running chooseCRANmirror() from the console will let you do 
that.  (There may be a way from the menu too.)

rpart doesn't do multiple responses - try package mvpart for a drop-in
replacement. Alternatively look at package party.

Also, you are not using formula correctly. What you should have written
is:

prey.data ~ Clength, data = turtle.data

What R does is look for variables in the formula from within the data
argument, and IIRC data is supposed to be a data frame. If it doesn't
find what it needs in data, it looks in the workspace. This probably
isn't correct - the real answer having to do with environments and
parents etc., but effectively in this case this is what happens.

Of course, it has to expand . from data and prey.data is a data frame. R
picks up turtle.data$Clength from the workspace. But this isn't a
multivariate tree. You are confusing the problem above with not being
able to deal with multiple responses.

If mvpart is not working then you need to show why and how it fails.
>From your description, the response is abundances of prey species, this
should be fine in mvpart.

Note though, that mvpart seems to need a data.matrix as the response so
something like this should work:

data.matrix(prey.data) ~ Clength, data = turtle.data

Many many thanks for making all these tools available. I wince when I
see my colleagues struggling with SPSS or SAS! R and the bundled and

This directory gets placed there and then removed when the upgrade is 
finished, to prevent two processes from trying to simultaneously update 
the directory. If you terminated an upgrade in an unexpected way, say by 
dropping your connection, then the file will be left and you need to 
manually remove it before you try to upgrade again.

If you have removed it, and it keeps re-appearing, it is a sign of 
something else going wrong (usually outside of R).

Hi Terry,

Speaking of coxph...

I noticed a silly inconsistency between summary.coxph and other modeling 
functions:

 > m <- summary( coxph( Surv(start, stop, event) ~ x, test2))
 > coef(m)
NULL
 > m$coef
coef exp(coef) se(coef) z p
x -0.02110521 0.979116 0.7951769 -0.02654153 0.98

 > coef(summary(lm.D9))

 > summary(lm.D9)$coef

the problem being that stats:::coef.default is looking for 
object$coefficients but summary.coxph uses rval$coef.

And while we're at it, if your "p" column was renamed "Pr(>|z|)" or so, 
then printCoefmat could have been used. Apart from significance stars 
(which you might well dislike), this also provides a nicer display of 
the p values themselves:

 > printCoefmat(summary(lm.D9)$coef)

(Intercept) 5.03200 0.22022 22.8501 9.547e-15 ***

You might consider the 'axis' argument (see ?axis.default). The main
catch is that you will need to allocate the space explicitly.

Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.44.0712102329450.8786-100000@mimosa.csv.warwick.ac.uk>

I would like to make a new vector with values taken from two existing
vectors conditional upon a third. At present I am doing this with a for loop
but wonder if there is not a neater way, given some of the very neat things
R can do.

a<-rep(c("A","B"),50)
b<-rep(1,100)
c<-rep(2,100)

a is thus "A" "B" "A" "B" "A" "B"...
b is thus 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
c is thus 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...

I want d[i] to be b[i] if a[i]=="A" and c[i] if a[i]=="B". I'm current using
a for loop:

d<-rep(0,100)     # initialise d
for(i in 1:length(a)) {if(a[i]=="A") d[i]<-b[i] else d[i]<-c[i]}

d is thus 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 ...

Is it possible to do something simpler, say along the lines of the c-style
?: conditional statement, or at least avoiding the for loop.

d <- a=="A"?b:c   # doesn't work, but you get the idea

Thanks in advance,
Neil

With this specific example this will work:

   as.numeric(factor(a))

If that is not the real case but its something else you could try any
of these which probably generalize better:

   (a == "A") + 2 * (a == "B")
   1 + (a == "B")
   ifelse(a == "A", 1, 2)

Paul,

Yes, I have manually removed it multiple times and it continues to 
reappear. I'll try to just upgrade a few packages at a time and see if 
there is one in particular that is causing the problem. Failing that, 
I'll run this past my system admin.

Thanks for your help,

You could use one of at least two simple approaches.

When b and c are numeric, then you could use

 d <- b*(a=="A") + c*(a=="B")

since the numeric operation coerces the logical 'a=="A"'
into 1 or 0 according as it is TRUE or FALSE, and vice versa.

If b and c are not numeric (and indeed generally, but the
above is neater for numeric variables), then:

 d <- b  ;  d[a=="B"] <- c[a=="B"]

which simply over-writes the b-values in d where a=="B".

Hoping this helps,
Ted.

Subject: [R]  the observed "log odds" in logistic regression
Message-ID: <14267125.post@talk.nabble.com>


 
Dear list:
     After reading the following two links:
http://luna.cas.usf.edu/~mbrannic/files/regression/Logistic.html
http://www.tufts.edu/~gdallal/logistic.htm
     I've known the mathematical basis for logistic regression.However I am
still not so sure about the "logit "
     For a categorical independent variable, It is  easy to understand the
procedures  how "log odds" are calculated. As I know, First the observations
are grouped according to the IV and DV, generating a contingency table.The
columns are the levels of IV, and the rows are the levels of DV(0, or 1).For
each column,we get the proprotions  for DV=0 and DV=1 at given IV. Using the
proportions  the log odds can be computed.Is that right?
   My problem  is this : in my data set , the IVs are continuous variables,
do I still have to generate such a table and compute the log odds for each
level of IV according to which the log odds are calculated?  
   In R , fitted(fit) gives the fitted probability for DV to be 1.  Dose the
observed probability exist ? If it does exist , how can I extract it ? If
the IV is cartegorical , the DV can readily changed to be a tow-culumned
matrix, thus log(the observed probabily/(1-the observed probability) might
be the "log odds". I wonder what if the IV is continuous ?
     And about the residuals. It seems that  the residual is not the actual
DV minus the fitted probability. For in my model extreme residuals lie well
beyond (0,1).  I wonder how   the residual is computed.
      Would you please help me ?  Thank all very much again.
    Regards,
    Bin Yue

Yes, the flags given in the R-admin manual.  (We don't currently have a 
Solaris 10 Sparc box running, but this was with the current Sun Studio 12 
at the time, just after it came out.)

Let's assume you are going to use glm in package stats. glm can be fed with 
data in three ways; in your case, you should use the "one-row/one 0-1 event"
format, that is the "long" style. You do not have to compute any logit, 
glm will do that for your.

The example coming closest to your's is the birthwt example in 
MASS/scripts/ch07.R  and chapter 7 in Venables/Ripley MASS. Try to generate 
a small, self-running example with a data set similar to your's, and you have 
a good chance to get a more detailed answer.

If IV is a continuous variable isn't possible you create a contingency
table because don't exist levels.

Similar is not possible calculate de log odds of P(IV=x) but is possible
calculate log odds of P(IV<x) or log odds of P(IV=x+delta) with delta
tend to zero. 

In this case is common create a cut-off for IV and fit log odds of
P(IV>x)

So to help you send a small part of your data and a reproductive example
to us because is more easy understand your question this way

Thank you for your reply!

I know that I don't have to do any logit , but I want to understand how R
fit the glm models.
I will read the examples your suggested .

That message should also have given a message box with more information, 
saying what the problem was: it does not usually mean the 'shared library' 
named.  It does for me:

'The application failed to start because libfftw3-3.dll was not found.'

Other DLLs are also missing: jpeg62.dll and libtiff3.dll (use pedump to 
find this out).  So you need to use Google to find those DLLs and put them 
on your PATH.

You also need to read 
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/contrib/2.6/ReadMe
and suggest to Uwe Ligges what he adds a note about this (it applies to 
SoPhy for libtiff3.dll as well).

I don't know where you got the idea to end R statements with ";".
I find it atrocious. It just does not belong to the S language
and its R implementation.

Please don't do it
 -- it hurts the eyes of most experienced R users
 -- it's extra clutter
 -- internally each extra ";" is an extra empty statement

OTOH, *please* do
 -- indent R code and 
 -- use spaces to increase readability 

This would make your above code into something like 

 cvListFiles <- list.files(fnDir)
 for(i in grep(paste("^", pfnStub,".*\\.RData$", sep = ""), cvListFiles)) {
     load(paste(fnDir, cvListFiles[i], sep = "/"))
     myFunction(rliObject)
     rm(rliObject)
 }

Something many readers on this list will much prefer to your
original, and hence start considering to look at ..

Incorrect.  You can easily create the log odds for IV=x1 vs. IV=x2

Not needed, and if you do, the resulting odds ratios are actually no 
longer scientific quantities of interest, i.e., they have no exact 
interpretation outside your sample of x's.  They are averaged over an 
unspecified distribution of x's.

Subject: [R] Simulating Case Control Data
Message-ID: <784724.18916.qm@web45807.mail.sp1.yahoo.com>

Dear R-Help-List,

I was wondering if anyone had experience simulating
case-control data in R?  I've been looking through
literature, and found that the main examples make
heavy parametric assumptions on the distributions of
the exposure (E), covariates (Z), and disease status
(D).  I would appreciate any guidance toward
resources/examples/literature that simulate
case-control data with fewer assumptions about the
underlying distributions of E, Z and D.

Thank you,
-R

Subject: [R] Error with rgl loading in BATCH mode
Message-ID: <1636121D4BAD492897522639D61B7C75@na.iac.cnr.it>

Dear all,
I'm trying to run a script that requires KernSmooth in BATCH mode but I get 
an error while loading rgl library that is needed by KernSmooth. Actually I 
have to run several batch files through a queue of a cluster, so I wouldn't 
need graphics at all.
I installed the latest releases of R (2.6.1) and rgl on my CentOS 4.2 Linux 
(clone of Red Hat EL) endowed with Rocks 4.2.1 suite for clusters.
If I run the R script from a ssh session on my PC equipped with X Server (I 
use Xming), everithing goes smoothly, rgl package is loaded correctly and 
the script runs smoothly. However when run in batch mode (that is through a 
submission to the cluster batch queue, where X Server evidently is not 
available) I have the following error when loading rgl:

Loading required package: KernSmooth
KernSmooth 2.22 installed
Copyright M. P. Wand 1997
Loading required package: mvtnorm
Loading required package: rgl
Error in dyn.load(file, ...) :
  unable to load shared library '/opt/R-2.6.1/library/rgl/libs/rgl.so':
  libGLU.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Error : .onLoad failed in 'loadNamespace' for 'rgl'
Error: package 'rgl' could not be loaded
Execution halted

I am issuing the follwing R bach command:
R CMD BATCH --vanilla --slave KS_S1.R

This kind of error appeared 3 years ago on this same list in a different 
contest: no final solution was given, but apparently newer versions of rgl 
fixed the problem. Does anyone have a clue about how to manage this problem 
for BATCH mode? Alternatively, since rgl shouldn't be needed at all becasue 
running in BATCH mode, does someone know how to prevent KernSmooth loading 
rgl?

Thanks so much

Hi

AFAIK sometimes this can happen if your .Rdata was saved when some 
packages had been in action. But in that case you should have your message 
extended with someting like:

"cannot load package ...." or similar. 

It helped me when I started plain R session invoked necessary packages and 
opened a particular workspace. However if your .Rdata is corrupted I do 
not know about any procedure how to restore it. Therefore it is 
recommended to save copies of your data in other formats (txt, csv, ...) 
and I usually save history periodically to separate files so I can go back 
to what I have done before.
Regards

Petr

I don't think this is anything to do with BATCH mode: the machine you are 
running R BATCH on does not have GLU installed.  rgl *will* load on a 
system without an X server running.

KernSmooth does *not* require the rgl *package*, so you are (twice) 
blaming an innocent party.  You have doctored the output to give a false 
impression, and should be blaming some other package that loads all of 
KernSmooth, mvtnorm and rgl (perhaps package ks).

You truncated the output here without indication to give a misleading

Thanks everybody for your help (and sorry to be silent : no network today
morning),
I think I will first try the solution of Greg Snow-2 or the one of Thierry
(because they gave examples of script - as a newbye it is very important to
me).

I'm also interested in the solutions proposed by Uwe and Gabor, but I'm not
familiar with environment variables (I will try ?Sys.getenv) and I have no
idea how to edit .rnw file with R (but as it seems that everything is
possible with R, so why not).

Again thank you,
And if you have further advices to help me writing scripts (in R for
example), do not hesitate.
Have a nice day,
Ptit Bleu.

PS : I'm using R version 2.5.1 (2007-06-27) with XP

I'd recommend using Emacs with ESS (see http://ess.r-project.org/).  The
advantage of this (beyond the seamless integration) is that its pretty
platform neutral, and what you learn on your new Mac system will be portable
(i.e. the same method of writing/interacting with your R script/session
whether your on Mac/M$-windows/*NIX variant).

Hello everyone, 

I would like to use the "if" statements and I was thinking sth like

If () {} else{ if() {} else{} } 

Is this a possible solution and is there any syntax error?

Could anyone give me some advice? Many thanks.

You could plot the barchart horizontally, and increase the margins to
allow the full labels:

windows(6,4) #or x11(6,4)
par(omd=c(0.2,1,0,1))
oo<-order(Frequency, decreasing=F)
barplot(Frequency[oo],names.arg=Reason.for.failure[oo], horiz=T,

Except the first letter, nothing sooms to be wrong.

> if (1==1) {print("a")} else { if(1==1) {print("b")} else{print("c")} } 
[1] "a"
> if (1==2) {print("a")} else { if(1==1) {print("b")} else{print("c")} } 
[1] "b"

[1] "c"
>

I beleive you noticed a difference between if() and ifelse() functions. 
And of course if you spread your command in several rows be carefull not 
to have valid syntax before you ended a whole command.
e.g.
if (1==2) {print("a")} 
else { if(1==2) {print("b")} else{print("c")} }

Error: unexpected 'else' in "else"

As described, the problem seems to be you don't have all the necessary
libraries installed.

You should install the libtiff and libjpeg library binaries. You can
get them from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/tiff.htm and
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/jpeg.htm. You also must check
that the binaries of the libraries are installed in a directory in
your PATH environment variable.

You also need to have libfftw3 installed on your system. You can get
it from ftp://ftp.fftw.org/pub/fftw/fftw-3.1.2-dll.zip, and as with
the other libraries, you should add it to your PATH variable too.

Yes, I guess we should add a note.


I hope you get it to work, and no doubt in asking what you need.

I concur. Emacs is one of very few cross-platform editors with a  
special mode for R/S-Plus. If you want to give Emacs a try, I  
recommend Aquamacs (http://aquamacs.org) on OS X. It ships with the  
latest ESS and is better integrated to the OS than a regular Emacs.

In the future, post Mac related question to r-sig-mac, though.

Subject: [R] R computing speed
Message-ID: <001001c83c05$ec8aedd0$ee64de8b@envcserge19>

Dear helpers,

I am using R version 2.5.1 to estimate a multinomial logit model using my
own maximum likelihood function (I work with share data and the default
function of R cannot deal with that).

However, the computer (I have an Athlon XP 3200+ with 512 GB ram) takes
quite a while to estimate the model.

With 3 categories, 5 explanatory variables and roughly 5000 observations it
takes 2-3 min. For 10 categories and 10 explanatory variables (still 5000
obs) more than 1 hour.

Is there any way I can speed up this process? (Modifying the code or
modifying some R options maybe?)

I would be really grateful if anybody could help me with this issue, I
attach my code below.

Many thanks,

Carlo

Dear Uwe,

Could you please give me the name of the function to open, to modify and to
save a r script ?
Just the name and I will look for the way to use them.

And if you have a link explaining how to use user customized variables from
an environment variable, it will be very helpful (as it is completely new to
me).

Thanks in advance,
Ptit Bleu.

------------------------------------------------


Within or before SWeave, you can use R.
Hence you can write some R function that first changes the rnw and runs 
SWeave thereafter, or even better, write something in your SWeave code 
that reads a user customized variables, e.g. from an environment 
variable or from some text file.

I would suggest that you use Rprof to get a profile of the code to see
where time is being spent.  You did not provide commented, minimal,
self-contained, reproducible code, so it is hard to tell from just
looking at the code to determine what is happening.  Rprof should
provide an idea of where to look in your code for optimization.  You
might consider colMeans instead of the "apply", but I am not sure if
this will make a significant change in the execution time.

I think you have glibc-headers missing.  On an F8 system I get

eclectus% rpm -qf /usr/include/limits.h
glibc-headers-2.7-2
eclectus% rpm -qf /usr/include/stdio.h
glibc-headers-2.7-2
eclectus% rpm -qf /usr/include/stdlib.h
glibc-headers-2.7-2

You may find that glibc-devel is also missing and needed.

Did you install the R-devel RPM (you cannot have built R on that system)?
That's the way to pull in the dependencies you need to make packages.

I think the only simple method that allows you to specify any arbitrary 
population distribution of predictors and does not rely on the logistic 
regression model being true is to simulate cohorts and then take a 
case-control sample from each one

Eg for a case-control sample of 500 cases and 1000 controls where there is 
about a 1% cumulative incidence
1. Generate all your predictor variables for a cohort of 50,000 people, 
from any distributions you want
2. Specify the disease model. This could be logistic
     logit(p(Y=1))=eta = b0+b1x1+b2x2+...
     p = exp(eta)/(1+exp(eta))
   or it could be anything else.
3. Now sum(p) gives the expected number of cases. Adjust b0 so that this 
is a bit bigger than your desired number, eg 550.
4. Generate Y for the population by rbinom(50000,1,p)
5. Choose 500 cases and 1000 controls using sample().

Dear Jim,

Thanks a lot for your suggestion. Indeed substituting the function apply
with rowSums made a great difference. Now the code is much faster!

Cheers,

Carlo

I would suggest that you use Rprof to get a profile of the code to see
where time is being spent.  You did not provide commented, minimal,
self-contained, reproducible code, so it is hard to tell from just
looking at the code to determine what is happening.  Rprof should
provide an idea of where to look in your code for optimization.  You
might consider colMeans instead of the "apply", but I am not sure if
this will make a significant change in the execution time.

You clearly haven't read and followed the preceding pages of the
chapter ;-)

See page 12, about 1/3 the way down the page.

Hi,

Plotting a graphic into a postscript device using family="mono" returns the
following error message:

>>	family 'mono' not included in PostScript device

Looking at postscriptFonts() however lists the "Courier" font as availeable
mono font. So where is the problem?


Thanks guys for your help.

The 'problem' is that you have not provided us with reproducible code, and 
used an obsolete version of R.  At least some of the ways you might have 
done this you needed to specify the 'fonts' argument to postscript().

As a minimal example,

> postscript(family="mono")
> plot(1:10)
> dev.off()

works in R 2.6.1.  If that does not work for you, you need to update.
If it does, you need to consider what you did differently.

Mastering regular expressions by Jeffrey Friedl
(http://books.google.com/books?q=editions%3AISBN0596528124) is the
classic reference.  Although it doesn't cover R explicitly, R does
support perl compatible regular expressions which are discussed in the
book.  Regardless, most of the topics are general enough not to depend
tightly on the specific regexp engine.

I'm not Uwe, but here are some of the things to try if you want to do
this fully in R.

Look at the help for scan,  one approach to reading in a .rnw file is to
use scan, but set it to read each row of the file as a character matrix.
The 'see also' section of the scan help page has some other functions
that could be used to read in the file as well.

Modify the read in character strings with the sub or gsub functions.

Use cat (with a file argument) to write the character strings back to a
file.

Also look at the commandArgs function for one way to pass options (the
device name(s)) to your R script.

You may also want to read (or reread) the "Invoking R" section of "An
Introduction to R".

Hope this helps,

Subject: [R] ggplot - Setting the y-scale in a bar plot
Message-ID: <20071211182017.9DEECF8001@smtp3.ualg.pt>

Dear All (probably Hadley),

I am now trying to customise some plots using a bar geom.

I do not want to use the default binning statistic, but rather 
calculate the bar heigths separately. I do manage this, but for 
comparison purposes I would like to have a set of plots all with the 
same y-axis height. But I do not seem to find out how to fix the 
scale of the y-axis in this case.
Any tips?
Using R 2.6.1 on Windows.

Thanks for any help,
Pedro

I attach below the code I am using:
plotdata<-data.frame(x=factor(2:8), y=0.1*(2:8))
plot1<-ggplot()
plot1<-plot1+layer(data=plotdata, 
mapping=aes_string(x='x',y='y'),geom='bar', stat='identity')

RangeY <-c(0,1)
YBreaks <- (0:10)*diff(RangeY)/10
YTickLabels<- as.character(YBreaks)

plot2 <- plot1 + scale_y_continuous(limits=RangeY, breaks=YBreaks, 
labels=YTickLabels, expand=c(0,0))
print(plot2)

I'm trying to solve a homework problem using R. The problem gives a list
of cricket chirps per second and corresponding temperature, and asks to
give the equation for the linear model and then predict the temperature
to produce 18 chirps per second. So far, I have:

I can then determine the answer to the prediction, using algebra and R:

However, I'd like to try to use the predict() function. Since 'chirps'
and 'temp' are just vectors of numbers, and not dataframes, these
failed:
predict(chirps.res, newdata=data.frame(chirp=18))
predict(chirps.res, newdata="chirp=18")
predict(chirps.res, newdata=18)

I then tried to turn my two vectors into a dataframe. I would have bet
money that this would have worked, but it didn't:
> df <- data.frame(chirps, temp)
>  chirps.res <- lm(chirps ~ temp, data=df)
> predict(chirps.res, newdata=data.frame(chirps=18))

Can anyone tell me how to use predict() in this circumstance?

Thanks for your help and advice.

actually, the lapply() was supposed to be used with your particular

to remove, all you need is:

rm(list=myObj)

I've found the O'Reilly pocket reference "Regular Expression" (about USD
10.00) quite handy.
It covers Perl, C, PHP, Python, Java, and .Net.

Great.
Two books were consistently recommended: the pocket guide "Regular
Expressions" and the more extensive "Mastering Regular Expressions", both by
O'Reilly.

Thanks to all those who responded.

Thanks for reply.

Yes, I have tried this, although I had to remove the "-xc99" flag from
the CC environment variable.  When used as shown in the installation
manual, the compile fails:

In file included from regex.c:107:
/usr/include/stdbool.h:42:2: #error "Use of <stdbool.h> is valid only in 
a c99 compilation environment."
*** Error code 1
The following command caused the error:
cpp -M -I../../src/extra/zlib -I../../src/extra/bzip2 
-I../../src/extra/pcre   -I. -I../../src/include -I../../src/include 
-I/usr/local/include -DHAVE_CONFIG_H regex.c > regex.d
make: Fatal error: Command failed for target `regex.d'
Current working directory /apps/local/src/R-2.6.1/src/main
*** Error code 1



By removing the "-xc99" flag and setting the others options as specified
in the installation manual, the R package builds completely, but the
"foreign" package continues to crash when I attempt to load it - all
of the other packages that I have tried seem to work just fine.   I
suspect that since those that have built with GCC are not reporting
any trouble, it would be difficult to point a finger at the "foreign"
code and claim that this is a bug, but yet, I am not having any trouble
with any of the other packages that have been built using Sun Studio 12.

Here are the latest "configure" options that I have tried (as
specified in the manual, minus the "-xc99" flag):

  % ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/R-2.6.1
               CC=/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc

I have recently applied several patches for Sun Studio 12.   I am
tempted to try Sun Studio 11 to see if there is any difference.

I guess the other alternative would be to grab the R package from
"www.sunfreeware.com".   However, most of the 3rd-party packages
on my system have been built with Sun Studio 12 - was just hoping
to be able to do the same with R.   I was also curious if anyone
else is using the latest (patched) Sun Studio 12 set of compilers
on Sun Solaris 10 (sparc) and had any luck.  I am running out of
different complier flags to try.   I have tried several different
flags and most times, the R packages will build, but everytime
that I attempt to load "foreign", it crashes.  Again, all of the
other R packages that I have tried seem to be fine - I am simply
running into trouble with "foreign" which I believe is needed for
me to install the "maptools" package.


All the best.

Hi,

depending on what you do and how (and why) you save objects in RData
files in the first place, you might be interested in knowing of the
loadObject()/saveObject() methods of R.utils, as well as
loadCache()/saveCache() in R.cache.

The R.utils methods are basically "clever" wrappers around
load()/save() in the 'base' package that does not rely on saving and
loading the variable name but rather the object.  To save multiple
objects you have wrap them up in a list structure or in an
environment.  Example:

x <- 1:100
saveObject(x, file="foo.RData")
y <- loadObject("foo.RData")
stopifnot(identical(x,y))

u <- list(x=x, y=y)
saveObject(u, file="bar.RData")
v <- loadObject("bar.RData")
stopifnot(identical(u,v))

The R.cache methods let you store objects/results to a file cache
without having to worry about filenames.  Instead the objects are
identified by lookup keys generated from other R objects.  This is
useful for temporary/semi-temporary storing of results, especially
computationally expensive results.  The file cache is persistent
between sessions.  Example:

x <- 1:100
key <- list("x")
saveCache(x, key=key)
y <- loadCache(key)
stopifnot(identical(x,y))

u <- list(x=x, y=y)
key <- list("u")
saveCache(u, key=key)
v <- loadCache(key)
stopifnot(identical(u,v))

Although not of immediate interest, the pathname of the above cache
files can be found by
findCache(key), e.g.
"~/.Rcache/78488a47006df5d333db9e200fc539c5.Rcache".  There are
methods for specifying the root of the file cache, and having
different subdirectories for different projects.

The above example is not showing the full power of using R.cache.
Instead consider this example:

slowFcn <- function(x, y, force=FALSE) {
  # Cached results?
  key <- list(x=x, y=y)
  if (!force) {
    res <- loadCache(key=key)
    if (!is.null(res))
      return(res);
  }

As you can see, I'm assuming that each of the selected .RData files contains an object named "rliObject" and I'm hoping that nothing in any of the files I'm loading overwrites an object in my environment.  I'd like to clean this up so that I can extract the object(s) from each data file, and feed them to my function, whatever their names are, without corrupting my environment.  I'd appreciate any assistance.  Thanks!

Hi Pedro,

What's the problem exactly?  You'll need to compute the range
yourself, and then use scale_y_continuous as you have below.

(Also you can abbreviate the bar chart plotting command to:
qplot(x, y, data=plotdata, geom="bar", stat="identity"))

Hi Hadley,

Well, the problem seems to be that ggplot is not recognizing the 
scale when set by scale_y_continuous, the maximum value stays exactly 
at the data range, irrespective of what I provide as range.
I am not familiar yet with proto, therefore I do have some difficulty 
delving into the code to find out exactly what is wrong, but I hope 
you can tell if I am doing something pretty stupid, or f it is a 
feature or a bug...

Cheers,
Pedro

Subject: [R] Writing a file to the disk
Message-ID: <000301c83c43$04859d80$2f01a8c0@dell2400>

I am having difficulty writing the code for the following operation:
I have a numeric vector pred_out of length 156. (N = 156). Under Windows XP, 
I need to write it to the disk in text format. Perhaps some kind soul would 
provide the code fragment. The file name is sheet_vec.txt. Please see [1] 
for the complete pathname.

Each number to be written out has the following format:

LL.RRRRRR where LL is the integral part and RRRRRR is the fractional part to 
six decimal places. Example: "10.226207" The integral part, LL, is a maximum 
of two digits long. All numbers are positive.

Another hypothetical example:

10.226207
 6.556988
 4.395678
etc. Each number is to be on a separate line. Please correct me if I am 
wrong: A \n (newline) character ends each line.

After writing the file, it can be closed but not destroyed. (What I plan to 
do next is copy and paste the pred_out data into a spreadsheet.) Compressed 
formats (zip, etc.) should be avoided if possible.

Your ideas?

Tom Jones

[1] The full Windows pathname is:

C:/Documents and Settings/Tom/My Documents/Election Day Study Nov 7, 06/

Sorry, but the pathname is too long to fit on one line.

Get the formatted numbers you want in a character vector, then use 
writeLines to write it out.  For example:

x <- rnorm(20)
text <- sprintf("%9.6f", x)
writeLines(text, file.choose())

This will open a file selection directory where you can navigate to the 
correct folder and enter the filename.  Alternatively, you could put the 
whole path to the file in place of file.choose().  As a third choice, 
you could just use "clipboard"; on Windows, this will write the text 
directly into the clipboard, and you can paste from there to your 
spreadsheet.

Hi,

I would like to plot multiple time-series plots

the same y-axis range for all of the plots for the
sake of comparison. I am pretty sure there is a quick
way to do it in plot.ts which I could not find.

Any help is very much appreciated.

Try using plot.zoo from the zoo package.  This plots them
all within the range 3000 to 5000:

library(zoo)
plot(as.zoo(EuStockMarkets), ylim = c(3000, 5000))

Let's get in the WayBack machine and return to 4 days ago when I said:

For your data:

> cor(prediction, input$TOTAL)^2
[1] 0.3300378

For R-squared, summary.lm uses

   ans$r.squared <- mss/(mss + rss)
   ans$adj.r.squared <- 1 - (1 - ans$r.squared) * ((n - df.int)/rdf)

and for your data rdf = 31, df.int = 0 and n = 35.

In other words, the Rsquared estimate form summary.lm adjusts for the
degrees of freedom and postResample does not.

Why doesn't it use the df? In ?postResample you would see

"Note that many models have more predictors (or parameters) than data
points, so the typical mean squared error denominator (n - p) does not
apply. Root mean squared error is calculated using sqrt(mean((pred -
obs)^2)). Also, R-squared is calculated as the square of the
correlation between the observed and predicted outcomes."

Since caret is useful for comparing different types of models, we use
biased estimate of the root MSE since we would like to directly
compare the RMSE from different models (say a linear regression and a
support vector machine). Many of these models do not have an explicit
number of parameters, so we use

   mse <- mean((pred - obs)^2)

Subject: [R] Sys.setlocale() and text()
Message-ID: <475F50D9.20003@wichita.edu>

Dear HelpeRs,

I have a question about the Sys.setlocale() command and plotting.  I am 
running Windows XP, with R 2.6.1.  My default locale is English_United 
States.1252.

I am trying to add a lowercase sigma to a plot using the following code:

Sys.setlocale("LC_CTYPE","greek")
plot(1:10,1:10)
text(4,3,"\xF3")


For R 2.6.1, this code gives me the glyph from my default (1252) instead 
of from the 1253 codes.  For an older version of R (2.3.0) on the same 
computer, this code gives me the lowercase sigma that I wanted.  I have 
been unable to pinpoint what has changed.  Thanks for the help, and I 
apologize if I am missing something obvious.

Subject: [R] Importing Large Dataset into Excel
Message-ID: <1197429329.475f525155179@webmail.fas.harvard.edu>


Hello all,


I seem to be having a problem importing a data set from Excel into R.  I'm using
the "read.table" command to import the data with the following line of code:

> newborn<-read.table("newborn edit.csv", header=T, sep=",")


where "newborn edit.csv" is the name of the file.  Unfortunately, I'm getting
back the following error message:


"Error in scan(file,, what, nmax, sep, dc, quote, skip, nlines, na.string, :
line 528 did not have 44 elements"


As far as I can tell, line 528 of the spreadsheet table does have the same
number of elements as the other rows - by chance can this error message mean
anything else?  Also, is there an easier way to import data from R into Excel
using a single line of R code?


Thanks,


Wayne

Hello:

Could someone share the info about how these two packages compare
to each other. I take it fdrtool is supposed to be "better", but I'm not
sure
if it is so.

?count.fields

count.fields will tell you how many items are in each line.  As you
said, they should all be the same, but this will confirm it.

field.count <- count.fields("newborn edit.csv", sep=",")
table(field.count)  # determine count of the fields on a line

They cannot.  You need a repository to know about dependencies, which are 
in the PACKAGES file.

Yes, create a local repository and use a file:// URL to access it. 
Details are in the R-admin manual (and in the archives of this list or 
R-devel).

Message-ID: <475F646F.3060005@gmail.com>

I'm still having problems with this 00LOCK error. Tonight I recompiled 
R-devel from scratch, created a new site-library directory after moving 
the old one to scratch storage, and tried reinstalling my packages. 13 
out of 290 packages successfully reinstalled and, once again, 00LOCK has 
appeared.

I tried to hack around this by installing packages one at a time, each 
time looking for 00LOCK and, if present, unlinking it recursively. This 
fails, although I can unlink other packages with identical permissions 
from within R. Outside of R, in the bash shell, I can rm -r 00LOCK 
without any problems. What follows is just some output demonstrating this.

Why does unlink not work for this one particular directory?

  x <- unlink("00LOCK", recursive = TRUE)

Message-ID: <fc.004c5401060233fd004c5401060233fd.6023447@oufcnt2.open.ac.uk>

I'm struggling a bit with R with understanding functions and what's going
on under the hood.

For example, I was given this snippet of code via this mailing list:

DF <- data.frame(A =c("A", "A", "A", "B", "C"), B=c(1,1,2,2,0))
g <- paste(DF$A, DF$B)
s <- split(DF, g)

split appears to be taken the string provided by paste, e.g. "A 1", and
then deciding that the first character "A" in this string relates to DF$A,
and the second character "1" to DF$B.

The split help pages don't really tell me why split is working like this -
maybe I'm just looking in the wrong place in the help page.

I've got plenty of books on R, but only one of them gives a bit of info on
the use of split - not in enough detail though.  Does the book referenced
in the help pages ("The New S Language") give more insight into
this and other functions?

Will I just get an Aha! moment with R after using it for a while?

Thanks in advance...

Chris

Maybe you misunderstand what split does:

> DF <- data.frame(A =c("A", "A", "A", "B", "C"), B=c(1,1,2,2,0))
a data frame with 2 columns

> g <- paste(DF$A, DF$B)

a character vector (which is internally turned into factor). And split 
splits your data frame DF into groups according to levels of "g". It does 
not at all lookup into columns of your data frame (and the help page does 
not even give you a suspicion that it shall behave like that).

first sentence in help page tells you
split divides the data in the vector x into the groups defined by f.

compare your result with
> g.f<-factor(g)
> str(g.f)
 Factor w/ 4 levels "A 1","A 2","B 2",..: 1 1 2 3 4
> g.n<-as.numeric(g.f)
> g.n
[1] 1 1 2 3 4

split(DF, g.f)
split(DF, g.n)

And try to explain with your idea how split works this
DF$A<-rnorm(5)
s <- split(DF, g)

Regards
Petr

The problem is often a misspecification of the comment.char argument. 
For read.table(), it defaults to '#'. This means that everywhere you 
have a '#' char in your Excel sheet, the rest of the line is ignored. 
This results in a different number of items per line.

You should better use read.csv() which provides better default arguments 
for your particular problem.
Best,

Philippe Grosjean

I would say that the issue is more often the character ', which is allowed 
as a quote in read.table and not in read.csv.

I think it means import from Excel into R, and there are several simpler 
ways described in the 'R Data Import/Export manual'.

Checking the task views is always good advice. A bit more detail on what 
"spatial explicit landscape simulations" are would help - can you use 
RandomFields, perhaps not? Can you use mechansisms in MCMCpack - see the 
Bayesian task view as well as the spatial one?

Subject: [R] Getting error message using R: Please help (it's coursework due
 in on Friday)
Message-ID: <14291568.post@talk.nabble.com>


I've been trying for the past 3 weeks to use R (much better than Matlab but I
am very bad with computers so I am very new to all of this) and know how to
input the data (hey, it's a start!) but every time I type in the following:

dcm <- decompose(information)

I get the following error message:

Error in decompose(information) : time series has no or less than 3 periods

Could you please aid me so that I can progress to the next step. What I am
in fact trying to do at the moment is plot a graph of the information so I
had assumed it would be:

dcm <- decompose(information)
Plot(dcm$trend)

but obviously it does not appear to be the case.

By the way the code I have right now in case it helps is:

information <- scan("everything.txt")
timeseries <- ts(information, frequency = 11, start = c(1970, 1994))
using <- window(timeseries, end = c(1990, 11))
dcm <- decompose(information)
Plot(dcm$trend)


Thank you very much in advance, I really appreciate the help.

Yes, but these are vector data, a DBH value at each point. To plot a grid 
(25 by 25, ...), you must assign the values to a grid, and there are lots 
of ways of doing that. Continuing the answer by Thierry Onkelinx:

set.seed(1)
x=runif(100,0,100)
y=runif(100,0,100)
dbh=runif(100,1,100)
rdata=data.frame(x,y,dbh)

library(sp)
coordinates(rdata) <- ~ x + y

grd <- GridTopology(c(2,2), c(4,4), c(25,25))
SP <- as(SpatialGrid(grd), "SpatialPixels")
whre <- overlay(SP, rdata)
SP_rdata <- SpatialPixelsDataFrame(SP, data=data.frame(dbh=rep(NA,
   25*25)))
SP_rdata$dbh[whre] <- rdata$dbh
# this takes the last dbh value is more than one falls in each grid cell
# so a bit more work is needed here
pts <- list("sp.points", rdata)
spplot(SP_rdata, "dbh", sp.layout=list(pts))

Or interpolate, and mask out empty cells:

library(gstat)
SP_rdata2 <- idw(dbh ~ 1, rdata, newdata=SP, idp=2.0, nmax=4)
is.na(SP_rdata2$var1.pred) <- !(1:625 %in% whre)
spplot(SP_rdata2, "var1.pred", sp.layout=list(pts))

for example.

Hello Eugen,

in a nutshell, I would not use neither of these models, but an ARMA(1,
0, 1) fitted to the log(x). Now, to your questions. If you use the
"trace = TRUE" argument in auto.arima(), you will see that your model
specification (l) is not tested. Why is this? Because, you supply a
vector and the frequency is 1 (i.e. frequency(x). If you now spot at the
code in auto.arima() it is clear that seasonal differences are not
tested for. 

Try this instead:

x <- ts(x, frequency = 12)
k <- auto.arima(x, D = 1, trace = TRUE)
logLik(k)
k$aic

Hence, this yields an ARIMA(1, 0, 1)(2, 1, 0)[12] as an "optimal" model
specification, which yields an even "better" result than your l model.
However, the results you report for l and k can be attributed to
over-fitting / over-differencing. If you examine your series more
closely:

plot(x)
acf(x)
pacf(x)
library(urca)
ur.kpss(x)
plot(ur.za(x))

i.e. the traditional approach for the identification stage in the
Box-Jenkins approach, you will detect, that
1) The series seems not to be stationary with respect to its variance,
but is not "trending".
2) ACF and PACF tapers off slowly and neither has a single spike nor
gives the PACF hindsight of seasonality.
3) Your series is stationary with a structural break.


Therefore, one can use the log-transform of x for variance stabilisation
and specify an ARMA(1, 0, 1)-model:

xl <- log(x)
m <- arima(xl, order=c(1, 0, 1))
m

Bernhard

The 'problem' is that you have not provided us with reproducible code, and
used an obsolete version of R.  At least some of the ways you might have
done this you needed to specify the 'fonts' argument to postscript().

As a minimal example,

> postscript(family="mono")

works in R 2.6.1.  If that does not work for you, you need to update.
If it does, you need to consider what you did differently.

summary ( lm(Gas ~ model.matrix(~ Insul/Temp - 1) - 1, data = whiteside) )

......................

That is, we need to take out "two intercepts."  Is this "correct"? 
Shouldn't lm check to see if an intercept has been requested as part of the
model formula?

If I do
##
summary(lm(as.formula(Gas ~ model.matrix (~ Insul/Temp-1, data=whiteside)),
data=whiteside))

.......................

we get a strange model.  But the formula part of this model qualifies as a
valid formula
##
as.formula(Gas ~ model.matrix (~ Insul/Temp-1, data=whiteside))

----------------

just as if I were to write: lm(Gas ~ Insul/Temp - 1, data=whiteside)

But we know that the _correct_ formula is the following

##
as.formula(Gas ~ model.matrix (~ Insul/Temp-1, data=whiteside) -1)

-----------------

(Sorry, this is getting really long) --- So, my question/confusion comes
down to wanting to know why lm() doesn't check to see if an intercept has
been specified when the model has been specified using model.matrix.

Regards,
Mark.

Er, are you sure it is "information" that you want to decompose()? (If
so, what are the computations of "timeseries" and "using" supposed to be
good for?)

Or read.delim/read.delim2, which should be even better at TAB-separated
files.

In general, be very suspicious of read.table() with such files, not only
because of the '#' but also because it expects columns separated by
_arbitrary_ amounts of whitespace. I.e., n TABs  counts as one, so empty
fields are skipped over.

By why would you want to do this?

Yes.

No, it does not.  In the Details section of lm's help page you will
find the following:

     A formula has an implied intercept term.  To remove this use
     either 'y ~ x - 1' or 'y ~ 0 + x'.  See 'formula' for more details
     of allowed formulae.

Thus, except if you explicitly ask for a constant term not be included,
lm will add a constant term (a column of ones) additionally to what
ever you have specified on the right hand side of the formula.

Well, you get a model in which not all parameters are identifiable, and
a particular parameter that is not identifiable is estimated by NA.  I
am not sure what is strange about this.

Debatable, the above command only shows that it can be coerced into a
valid formula. :)

Why is this formula any more correct than the other one?  Both specify
exactly the same model.  It is just that one does it in an
overparameterised way.

Because lm() is documented not to check this.  If you do not want to
have an intercept in the model you have to specifically ask it for.

Also, comparing the output of 
	summary( lm(Gas ~ Insul/Temp - 1, data = whiteside) )
and
	summary( lm(Gas ~ Insul/Temp, data = whiteside ) )

you can see that lm() does not check whether there is an implicit
intercept in the model.  Compare the (Adjusted) R-squared values
returned; one case is using the formula for models with no intercept
the other one the formula for models with intercept.  Similar story
with the reported F-statistics.  

Cheers,

	Berwin

Yes - if you insist on doing things that way

>

> model formula?

It does, (i.e. whether the user specified -1 in the formula argument),
but you specified it inside model.matrix() so the formula parsing code
never sees it. One wouldn't want lm to need to know about all functions
that have/could ever be written in R, past or future, to know how to
divine that here you wanted "-1" to mean "remove intercept please Mr. R
Parser" and not "subtract 1 from this result please Mr. R Parser".

You are really abusing the reason for having the formula interface. The
whole point of it is to make it easy for user to specify a model, from
which R generates the model matrix for you. Why use the formula at all
if you have already produced your model matrix?

See ?lm.fit for a fast way of fitting linear models (used within lm() )
if you have all the bits in place (i.e. you already have a model matrix)
and are happy to take care of other details yourself.

I guess because you can't programme around every possible usage that a
user might dream up to try. If it did, lm would be an absolute pig and
run like one. It is slow enough as it is with all the user-friendly
stuff in there to help. (By slow enough, I mean it is perfectly speedy
in routine use, but you wouldn't want to use it in a permutation
test-like environment if you were after speed - you'd be better off
working with lm.fit directly)

The model.matrix bit is returning a matrix (without an entry for an
intercept), which is fine on the rhs of a formula. As all you've done
here is (effectively) create the following model:

> form <- formula(paste("Gas ~", 
+                 paste(colnames(model.matrix (~ Insul/Temp-1,
+                                data=whiteside)), collapse = " + ")))
> form
Gas ~ InsulBefore + InsulAfter + InsulBefore:Temp + InsulAfter:Temp

I.e., that is what your convoluted formula is being interpreted as, you
then still need to remove the intercept that R will automagically add to
the model when it subsequently creates the model matrix.

fields are skipped over.

******* End of other contributions (not sure why my mailer didn't mark 
them)

I would also say be very suspicious of Excel writing .csv files.
I found by looking at the .csv file in an editor that for some reason when 
there were empty fields in the original .xls file that for some records, 
Excel didn't add in enough commas to make up the correct number of fields.
It did for some records but not for others. Excel truly works in 
misterious ways.

read.csv has an argument fill which should fix this problem. In my case I 
was actually reading the .csv file into mySQL and the solution was to 
select the whole of the .xls file and format it as text before writing the 
.csv file.

Hello Wang

matrix bb is symmetric positive semidefinite, so
algebraically the eigenvalues are nonnegative.

I would use

bb <- crossprod(b)

to calculate bb (faster and possibly more accurate)

Look at eigen(bb,TRUE,TRUE)$values

(see ?eigen for the meaning of the arguments) to see how
many very small eigenvalues you have.  The number of zero
eigenvalues is equal to the number of linear relations
in the columns of b.

doesn't make a difference.
The timeseries is simply the time series of this data between the two dates
and using is the data up to 1990 as opposed to 1994.

Yes. Since the matrix is positive semidefinite by construction, I'd
probably go for chol(bb, pivot=TRUE), then the first "rank" elements of
"pivot" gives you a maximal subset of linearly independent columns, and
you can proceed by something like lm(b[,-subset]~b[,subset]) to see what
the linear dependencies are.

(Other approaches could be eigen() and svd().)

And isn't it one of the latter two you want to decompose()?

Subject: [R] how to obtain the CPU time of my program

Hi,

first of all 'sorry' for my rather late post on this topic...

Did you already came across the R command 'Rprof' ? This might help you
to find answers to your problem in terms of CPU time/command.
I use 'Rprof' like this:

>Rprof()
>source("yourCode.R")
>Rprof(NULL)

This produces a file called Rprof.out in your working directory.
Quit R and type 'R CMD Rprof Rprof.out'.

I am too new in using those profiling methods of R but I think they are
pretty handy.

Try out ?Rprof for detailed information.

Cheers,
Christian

If you are using a windows system you could take a look at the 
xlsReadWrite packages (there are functions for reading xls files).

The easiest way is to read (in the manual)

   If you have only a source package that is known to work with current R
   and just want a binary Windows build of it, you could make use of the
   building service offered at win-builder.r-project.org.

Is that what was too hard for you?  If so, you are out of luck.
(Kudos to Uwe Liggges for this service.)

It's not specific to R, which wraps regular expressions up in quoted
strings so has a couple of wrinkles compared to Perl, but I found the
O'Reilly " Regular Expression Pocket Reference" a good quick reference,
and rather cheaper than the whole book. It's hard to see R users needing
chapter and verse on the complete gamut of regexps.

What I'm trying to do is have plots and summary statistics of x
(autocorrelations for example) where x refers to the data in using, and I
thought decomposing would be the way to go about it.

I was, and the answer is yes, but I figured the easiest way for you to
understand is for me to say exactly what I am trying to do. Perhaps I don't
even need to decompose (although I think I do). If I can get past this
problem it would make everything else so much easier.

One has to remember that books go out of date: for example the advent of 
UTF-8 locales has led to a number of changes in the implementations. 
The O'Reilly books have third (2006) and second (2007) editions.  (BTW the 
pocket reference is not by the same author as 'Mastering Regular 
Expressions', so in no sense is part of 'the whole book'.)

I don't think anyone has mentioned the references given on the help page 
?regexp: they are a great deal more reliable than some of the third-party 
write-ups that have been mentioned.

I agree that emacs seems to the best editor (especially if one knows
it already).
But there is one _big_ drawback: you cannot plot (interactively) to a
quartz device which looks much nicer than the usual X11 (or any other)
device.

Well, "chirps" (not "chirp", BTW) was your *response* in the lm() call!
Your new data has to be called "temp", otherwise either the regression 
did not make sense or you are confusing different things.

Best,

Peter was trying to get you to see that you should be doing one of the
following:

dcm <- decompose(timeseries)

or

dcm <- decompose(using)

*Not* decompose(information), which will try to decompose your data
frame, which is not a timeseries object in the sense of ?ts and
therefore doesn't have periods and the like, hence the error.

Do either of the two suggestions that Peter clearly suggested you try
(and I repeat above) work for you and give you what you want?

From HDoran at air.org  Wed Dec 12 14:27:27 2007

Subject: [R] IRT Likelihood problem
Message-ID: <2323A6D37908A847A7C32F1E3662C80E012DEBD4@dc1ex01.air.org>

I have the following item response theory (IRT) likelihood that I want
to maximize w.r.t. to theta (student ability).

L(\theta) = \prod(p(x))

Where p(x) is the 3-parameter logistic model when items are scored
dichotomously (x_{ij} = 0 or 1) and p(x) is Muraki's generalized partial
credit model when items are scored polytomously (x_{ij} = 0 \ldots J).

Now, I wrote the following two functions to maximize the likelihood. The
first one is for the 3PL and works when all items are scored
dichotmously. The second is for the GPCM and gives the MLE when all
items are scored polytomously.

In the code below, this requires that I first have in hand estimates of
the item parameters so that the maximization is only w.r.t. theta. 

# x = response pattern
# b = vector of location parameters
# a = vector of discrimination parameters 
# c = vector of guessing paramete
theta.3pl <- function(x, b, a, c){
 opt <- function(theta) -sum(dbinom(x, 1, c + ((1-c)/(1 +
exp(-1.7*a*(theta - b)))),  log = TRUE))
 start_val <- log(sum(x)/(length(x)/sum(x)))
 out <- optim(start_val , opt, method = "BFGS", hessian = TRUE)
 out$par
 }

# score = the category the student scored in for item i
# d     = the item parameters for the ith item 
# a     = the discrimination p
# Muraki's GPCM
pcm.max <- function(score, d, a){
    pcm <- function(theta, d, score, a)
exp(sum(a*(theta-d[1:score])))/sum(exp(cumsum(a*(theta-d))))
    opt <- function(theta) -sum(log(mapply(pcm, d, theta = theta, score=
score )))
    start_val <- log(sum(score-1)/(length(score-1)/sum(score-1)))
    out <- optim(start_val, opt, method = "BFGS", hessian = TRUE)
    round(out$par, 2)
  }

However, I have data for which there is a mixture of item types. Some
are dichotomous and others are polytomous. Therefore, I need to somehow
modify these functions to work in a conditional statement that first
evaluates whether the item is dichotomous or not and then uses the right
function to write out and then maximize the likelihood. However, I'm a
bit stumped on how I might code this. Can anyone suggest how that might
work?

For example, assume I have a test consisting of 3 items. The first two
are dichotomous and the last is polytomous. Assume the students score on
these three items is:

x <- c(1,0,3) # that is, 'right', 'wrong', 'scored in category 3'

And further assume the item parameters for these items are

Item 1 c = .11, b = 1.2, a = .58
Item 2 c = .20, b = .65, a = 1.2
Item 3 d = (0, -1.4, -.28, .95)

Now, my function pcm.max also reduces to Master's partial credit model
when a = 1 for all items. And, because Master's partial credit reduces
to the Rasch model when items are scored dichotmously, the only function
I need is pcm.max when working within the Rasch family of models.
However, Muraki's model does not reduce to the 3PL because of the
guessing parameter when items are scored dichotomously, so I think the
problem is slightly more complex in this scenario and requires the use
of both functions.

Last, and a bit tangentially, it is possible when maximizing the 3PL
that I will converge upon a local and not global maximum, a situation
that does not occur with Rasch or 2PL. I only know of two methods for
knowing whether I converged upon the right max. First, plot the
likelihood and look at it or second, use different starting points and
see if I converge to the same max. However, I am maximizing this
likelihood over 80,000 students (or so) and I don't think either of
these two methods are viable. If anyone has a suggestion on how I could
proceed thoughtfully on that issue I welcome that as well.

Many thanks,
Harold

They are good technical references, but I don't think they're very
helpful for someone trying to learn regular expressions.  For example,
mastering regular expressions takes a very task based approach which
is helpful if you want to learn how to match an email address or url
correctly with a regular expression (harder than most people think),
or to match paired brackets.

Although I was wrong on what I was trying to decompose that didn't work
either however after a conversation with the lecturer the problem has been
found and solved.

There is an agreement plot (and a relative measure) in the vcd package.
Maybe it could be useful.

Subject: [R] OS-dependent behaviour of strucchange?
Message-ID: <475FEB22.6010002@ne.su.se>

Using the following code:

library(strucchange)
load(file="y.rda")
ar1<-formula(y~lag(y,k=-1))
plot(Fstats(ar1))

(where the the data file can be downloaded from
www.ne.su.se/~mlu/downloads/y.rda) I have a problem replicating
identical plots on different implementations of R for different
operating systems; I get completely different results under Debian Linux
compared to Windows XP.

I have tested three different Windows XP desktops running R 2.6.1 (one)
or 2.6.0 (two) and two different Debian Linux desktops running R 2.6.1. 
In all cases strucchange was version 1.3-2. The Windows desktops all
produced the same result (see the file windows.ps available at the same
address as the data). The Linux desktops also all produced identical
results (the file linux.ps also on the same address) although this was
different from that produced by the Windows desktops. Testing the
different desktops we made sure that we used exactly the same code and
data files.

Completely lost about the possible cause and therefore grateful for any
advice,

Subject: [R] XML R function description
Message-ID: <BAY120-DAV9DDB82E8DAF6A3A520020B76B0@phx.gbl>

Hi,

I was wondering if there is a standard for R function description in XML (or 
any plain text) format.

Rd files are the closest thing I found, but they do not describe the 
argument (or return value) types.
The purpose would be to write a program to automate the creation of C# 
wrapper around any R function, but without the argument type Rd descriptions 
are useless.

Any clues...

thank you

Dear useRs,

by a circular diagram representation I mean what you will get by entering
this at your R promt:

pie(1:5)

Nice to have R as a lingua franca :-)

The folowing quote is from page 360 in this very interesting paper:

@article{SpenceI2005,
     title = {No Humble Pie: The Origins and Usage of a Statistical Chart},
     author = {Spence, I.},
     journal = {Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics},
     volume = {30},
     pages = {353-368},
     year = {2005}
}

QUOTE
Like us, the French employ a gastronomical metaphor when
they refer to Playfair's pie chart, but they have preferred
instead to invoke the name of the wonderful round soft
cheese from Normandy - the camembert. When I spent 4 months
in Paris a few years ago, a friend invited my wife and me to
lunch with her elderly father who lives in Rouen, Normandy,
about an hour North of Paris. Her father inquired -
coincidentally during the cheese course - what work I was
doing in Paris; I replied that I was researching the
activities of a Scot, William Playfair, during the
revolutionary period. I told him that Playfair had invented
several statistical graphs, including the pie chart, which I
referred to, in French, as <<le camembert.>> After a stunned
silence of perhaps a couple of seconds, the distinguished
elderly gentleman looked me in the eye and exclaimed, <<Mon
Dieu ! Notre camembert?>>
UNQUOTE

So, I'm just curious: how do you refer in your own language to
this kind of graphic? How do you call it?

Best,

Jean

In Danish it is "Lagkagediagram" as in the layer cakes that are
traditional at birthday parties (and thrown at eachother's faces in

Subject: [R]  how to shorten elements in a data frame?
Message-ID: <14296509.post@talk.nabble.com>


I have a data frame ("res$data" in the example below), and I'd like to walk
through it, doing an approx() to interpolate each element in turn based on
the value of the item named "pressure" that is in the data.frame.

I've put some code below.  I had hoped that the commented-out "length() <-"
line would let me adjust the lengths of the items, but that has no effect,
since I get an error that the replacement has 2 rows (correct, as I'm
testing this), although the data has 87 rows (again, that's the correct
value for the field upon which I'm doing the approx() interpolation.)

Q: is there a way I can change the length of an element in a data frame, so
that I can replace straight into it? 

PS. the code doesn't know the names of the items in the data frame in
advance, although it is certain that one of them is called "pressure". 
(This is an oceanographic application, in case anyone wonders why pressure
would be an independent variable for use in interpolation.)


<code>

#interpolate to target pressures in "pt".
npt <- length(pt)
for (datum.name in data.names) {
    if (datum.name != "pressure") {
        length(res$data[[datum.name]]) <- npt
        res$data[[datum.name]] <- approx(x$data[["pressure"]],
x$data[[datum.name]], pt)$y
    }
}

</code>

Hi Gavin, Berwin,

Thanks for your detailed replies.  I'll make a general reply, if you don't
mind.

To reiterate, my main point is that if model.matrix() can be used in this
way, then lm() shouldn't add an intercept.

>> ... lm(Gas ~ model.matrix(~ Insul/Temp - 1), data = whiteside) ....

And the documentation for lm() indicates. albeit indirectly, that
model.matrix can be used in this way.  It calls for a formula, or something
that can be coerced to one.  And the following meets that criterion:
as.formula(Gas ~ model.matrix (~ Insul/Temp-1, data=whiteside)), and this
specifies no intercept.

On the question of why I want to mess about in such a labarynthine way. 
Well my email was largely expository.  With a straight call to lm(), I
wouldn't bother with model.matrix.

So, it really was about getting at lm coefficients inside a function (when
you have to get the terms &c. from somewhere else), and trying to understand
properly how things work, and why they work the way they do, and even if
they should work the way they do.

For instance:---

    if (ols) {
        obj <- x[[1]]
        mt <- terms(obj)
        mf <- model.frame(obj)
        y <- model.response(mf)
        X <- model.matrix(mt, mf, contrasts = obj$contrasts)
        if (attr(mt, "intercept") == 1)                    ## This is my
hack to overcome the double-intercept problem
            { olscf <- summary(lm(y ~ X))$coefficients }
        else {
            olscf <- summary(lm(y ~ X - 1))$coefficients
        }
        rownames(olscf) <- rownames(coef(obj))

Thanks again for your input.

Regards,
Mark.

I just got stuck with a quite simple question. I've just read in an

For small data sets

data.matrix <- cbind(V1,V2,V3);

works. But how could I put together 1200 columns?

I've searched the R mailing help and stumbled upon this entry:

Subject: [R] discrepancy between periodogram implementations ? per and
	spec.pgram
Message-ID: <475FF863.6030403@wis.kuleuven.be>

hello,

I have been using the per function in package longmemo to obtain a 
simple raw periodogram.
I am considering to switch to the function spec.pgram since I want to be 
able to do tapering.
To compare both I used spec.pgram with the options as suggested in the 
documentation of per {longmemo} to make them correspond.

Now I have found on a variety of examples that there is a shift between 
the log of the periodogram with per and that with spec.pgram. This 
vertical shift amounts to  approx. 1.8  on the log scale  (the graph of 
spec.pgram being above the one from per).

Is there some explanation for this ? Is the one from spec.pgram the 
better one as suggested in the documentation of per {longmemo}? Finally 
how are these related to an estimate of the spectral density obtained 
from spec.arima ?

Many thanks for help and clarification.

I recommend the following Book on regular expression matching: 

"Mastering Regular Expressions" by Jeffrey Freidl
Publisher: O'Reilly
ISBN:0-596-52812-4

Based on the my "blood, sweat and tears" of using regex type patterns
which can be very obfuscated, in addition to reading
the syntax from the above book there is some very good software
tools to test the patterns:

See these link:
http://regexlib.com/default.aspx

http://www.regular-expressions.info/

Finally in the software spirit of R and Shareware an invaluable too to
Test expressions is the software:
1-Expresso  http://www.ultrapico.com/
2-Regexdesigner.Net http://www.sellsbrothers.com/

Hope this Helps...

They are good technical references, but I don't think they're very
helpful for someone trying to learn regular expressions.  For example,
mastering regular expressions takes a very task based approach which is
helpful if you want to learn how to match an email address or url
correctly with a regular expression (harder than most people think), or
to match paired brackets.

Thanks very much for the response.  I think I left out an important 
detail, however.

I want my lowercase sigma to be displayed in a specific font from the 
Rdevga file (my project involves fonts).  So far as I know, quote() does 
not allow me to select a font.  Thus, I am specifically interested in 
the text() command and reasons why my example code performs differently 
in R 2.3.0 vs 2.6.1.

Thanks,
Ed

This is the problem - it doesn't! 

What is says is model.matrix() don't add an intercept to the returned
model matrix. R then tries to work out what to do with the returned
matrix that is now on the rhs of the formula. But note that at no point
have you gotten round the fact that it will add an intercept *after* the
formula is parsed and a -1 is not found. This is because model.matrix is
called again, internally in lm but not with your formula as an argument
but with a terms object and nowhere in this object is it specified not
to include an intercept.

To do this, lm would have to parse the formula for model.matrix(....)
and if it finds something work accordingly.

In this instance, you don't want to be working with lm. You can use
lm.fit which returns an object with $coefficients, so I would guess you
need something like this (not tested)

    if (ols) {
        obj <- x[[1]]
        mt <- terms(obj)
        mf <- model.frame(obj)
        y <- model.response(mf)
        X <- model.matrix(mt, mf, contrasts = obj$contrasts)
	fit <- lm.fit(X, y) ## store fit in case you need something else
	olscf <- coef(fit)  ## get coefficients using an extractor function
        ##if (attr(mt, "intercept") == 1)  ## This is my hack to overcome the double-intercept problem
        ##    { olscf <- summary(lm(y ~ X))$coefficients }
        ##else {
        ##    olscf <- summary(lm(y ~ X - 1))$coefficients
        ##}
        ##rownames(olscf) <- rownames(coef(obj))
}

Note also, that even if you are using your hack, you don't need to do

summary(lm(y ~ X))$coefficients

as

coef(lm(y ~ X))

will do.

lm is mainly there for top-level work. If you need to do things like you
have above, use lm.fit or do the qr decomposition yourself.

Or try a different way to build the formula you need and work with lm;
Bill Venables has a nice piece in R News Vol 2 Issue 2 in the
Programmer's Niche section on something that might be of use if you want
to build a correct formula for your needs from the colnames of X and y?

All the best,

There are several definitions of a periodgram.  Note that

[1] 1.837877

See the comments in ?spectrum about scalings.

I think the comments in ?per incorrectly ignore the scaling issues: per() 
does not take the base frequency into account and has an extra divisor of 
2*pi.  E.g.

> x <- rnorm(64)
> spec.pgram(x, taper=0, detrend=F)$spec/per(x)[-1]
  [1] 6.283185 6.283185 6.283185 6.283185 6.283185 6.283185 6.283185 6.283185

What is spec.arima?  If you meant spec.ar, that is on the same scale as 
spec.pgram for series with base frequency 1 (and for all series for R >= 
2.7.0).

In case anyone with a similar need comes across this thread, I am posting
below a solution to my problem, in which I construct a new data frame that
has the desired dimensions, instead of trying to change the dimensions of
the existing data frame.

<code>
	npt <- length(pt)
	# Step through each variable.
	data.names <- names(x$data)
	data.new <- as.data.frame(array(NA, dim=c(npt, dim(x$data)[2])))
	names(data.new) <- data.names
	for (datum.name in data.names) {
		if (datum.name != "pressure") {
			data.new[[datum.name]] <- approx(x$data[["pressure"]],
x$data[[datum.name]], pt)$y
		}
	}
	# Now replace pressure
	data.new[["pressure"]] <- pt
	res$data <- data.new
</code>

Subject: [R] Overlay PDF on histogram
Message-ID: <CDCD66E2-6E16-4F28-B198-92B36560B53D@gmail.com>

Hi,

I thought that I had read somewhere that there was a really simple  
way to overlay the probability density function of a normal  
distribution over a histogram, after the histogram has already been  
plotted.  Possibly a one word command.

I've found this email from the archives, but I don't think this is  
what I'm looking for.  I thought there was something more simple than  
the curve function.

http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/help/05/04/3523.html

R> x <- rnorm(100)
R> hist(x, freq = FALSE)
R> curve(dnorm, col = 2, add = TRUE)

Is there a simple way to do this, or is my memory failing me?  Thank  
you.

James

Subject: [R] Reproducibility of experiment
Message-ID: <8641331554darteta001@ikasle.ehu.es>

Dear list,

I have an experiment that I have run 10 times in order to find out its 
reproducibility. I wonder if there is any function that I can use for 
obtaining a significance value of reproducibility or agreement of 
measurements. I thought of coefficient of variation but, as far as I 
know, I would have to set a threshold for saying the experiment is not 
reproducible. Any pointers to something more "objective" would be very 
helpful.

Thanks

David

Can anyone advise me on some pratical papers or books 

On Gaussian Copulas? Anything in the genre of Copulas Dummies

Would be a help.

 

As simpe, and approachable with minimal pedantic style.

Thanks,

That seems simple enough to me. 1 line, the holy grail!

Is there a problem with using curve in your actual application?

Dear Prof. Ripley: 

      Thanks for your help.  I very much appreciate your great 
generosity in both your substantive contributions to the code and 
documentation for R and in responding to so many questions, helping to 
make R what it is today. 

      In the real application that led to the toy example below, I had 
defined

            AIC.factanal <- function(object, ..., k=c(2, "BIC")){ ... }

      1.  If I understand your suggestion, I'd be better NOT defining an 
"AIC.factanal" but instead define only "logLik.factanal" and let methods 
dispatch go through "AIC.default" to "logLik.factanal".  Is this correct? 

      2.  Is it inappropriate to supply other optional values for an 
argument in a generic function like this? 

      3.  If it is OK to specify options for "k" like this, how would 
you suggest I do it?  Use the S4 standard? 

      Thanks again. 
      Spencer Graves

I think the only thing which needs explaining is why it worked in 2.3.1: 
you can't usually switch 8-bit locales in an application on Windows and 
expect to get the right font.  Most likely it was fortuitous that it 
worked: it was only intended to work in a multibyte locale (see the entry 
in CHANGES for 2.3.0), and that principally to aid testing of non-Western 
locales by the developers.

But if you are really interested in differences then you will need to 
study the changes in the source code for yourself: the price you paid does 
not include that level of support.

One of the holdups has been that we tried still to support Windows 9X/ME. 
That will be dropped as from R 2.7.0 and so we can use Unicode to access 
the glyphs via text().  Your example works for me in R-devel, so please 
try that in a day or two (I think it needs a recent change).

Note though that switching locales within a session is fragile: it 
invalidates all existing 8-bit data, and so for example repainting the 
graphics window or the console can change the glyphs displayed.  (In 
R-devel, try changing back to US and resize the graphics window.)

But it does help: it tells you to look in the C code in the sources. 
I'll help you along by telling you it is in src/gnuwin32/extra.c, and 
refers to a graphapp function that draws the dialog box.

The basic functions you need are
image()
contour()

although I like better the plot.surface() function in the 'fields' package.

I suspect that you are going to have to be more specific regarding the
subject matter and the experimental design so that those with the
requisite expertise could comment.

If this is looking at a continuous measure (ie. instrumentation
measurements), you could look at Bland-Altman methods. More information
here:

  http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mb55/meas/meas.htm

Otherwise, given that Google returns almost a million hits with the
phrase "reproducibility of experiment"...

That's a great help, many thank's for walking me through it; that's the
stuff I need to get me through to the next level.

Hi Andre,

I don't quite understand what you are trying to do.  Why you are using 
cbind to join columns of a dataset that it is already in table form?  It 
is true that read.table will give you a data.frame instead of a matrix, 
but if for some reason you need a matrix you can do simply

data.matrix=as.matrix(data)

In Danish it is "Lagkagediagram" as in the layer cakes that are
traditional at birthday parties (and thrown at eachother's faces in
slapstick comedy).

Hi Wayne,

I'm assuming that you file is really a comma-separated file (*.csv) and 
not an Excel workbook (*.xls) saved with a .csv extension, right?  That 
(in my experience) is a common mistake.
You should open your file with a simple text editor (notepad will do if 
the file is not too large) and review line 528, instead of reviewing the 
spreadsheet in Excel.  You should be able to spot the problem right away.

Subject: [R] Rgui: workaround for hang from tseries and other packages using
 Fortran I/O
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0712121828470.27897@gannet.stats.ox.ac.uk>

Several people have reported hanging when using garch() from tseries under 
Rgui (Windows), as well as from other packages using Fortran I/O.

We will have a revised tseries that does not suffer from the problem 
shortly, but here is a generic workaround: set the environment variable
GFORTRAN_STDOUT_UNIT to -1 before running R (critically before using any 
package or module such as Lapack, BLAS ... that uses Fortran)
One simple way to do this is to have

if(.Platform$GUI == "Rgui") {
     Sys.setenv(GFORTRAN_STDOUT_UNIT = "-1")
     Sys.setenv(GFORTRAN_STDERR_UNIT = "-1")
}

in your ~/.Rprofile file.  The second line is not needed for tseries but 
could be needed for other programs.  This will be in R-devel and R-patched 
shortly.

Note that Fortran output is still lost: this is just a palliative measure 
and the real fix for tseries generates the desired output.

(I had to read through the libgfortran to find this: it is confusing that 
Windows I/O is done by a file named unix.c!)

In Danish it is "Lagkagediagram" as in the layer cakes that are
traditional at birthday parties (and thrown at eachother's faces in
slapstick comedy).

Which indicates that the coefficients being estimated for each level
of st.num do not correspond to any of the fixed-effects coefficients,
hence the coef method, in the sense that it is used in nlme and lme4,
cannot be applied.

You will need to change the fixed-effects specification so that it
includes z.inc.  This may mean modifying the contrasts from
factor(z.inc).  I would suggest switching to polynomial contrasts then
replacing the linear term by z.inc

I've never found this particularly easy to do.  For a recent client I wrote:

library(effects)
library(multcomp)
library(multcompView)


effectsum <- function(model, effect) {
  effects <- as.data.frame(all.effects(model)[[effect]])

  mcp <- list("Tukey")
  names(mcp) <- effect
  class(mcp) <- "mcp"

  glht_sum <- summary(glht(model, linfct = mcp))
  p <- as.vector(glht_sum$test$pvalues)
  names(p) <- gsub(" ", "", names(glht_sum$test$tstat))

  groups <- multcompLetters(p)
  effects[, 1] <- factor(effects[, 1])
  effects$group <- groups$Letters[as.character(effects[, 1])]

  effects
}


which allows you to do:

mtcars$cyl <- factor(mtcars$cyl)
simple <- lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl, data=mtcars)
effects <- effectsum(simple, "cyl")

library(ggplot2)
qplot(cyl, fit, data=effects, min = lower, max = upper,
geom="pointrange", ylab="Mean effect") + geom_text(aes(label = group,
y = min(lower) - diff(range(lower)) * 0.07))

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = cyl, y = mpg)) + geom_crossbar(aes(min=lower,
max=upper, y=fit), data=effects, width=0.2) +
geom_point(aes(colour=wt))

This gives lsmeans (aka population marginal means) with their standard
errors, and groups generated from all pairwise comparisons adjusted
for multiple comparisons.

I would love to improve this code: to deal with all factors in a model
automatically.  Additionally, all.effects and multcompLetters are
rather fragile with respect to level names - if you get an error try
removing any non-alphanumeric characters,

Subject: [R] 64-bit package compilation problems on powerpc
Message-ID: <476053B4.4080702@gmail.com>

I have been working with my sysAdmin to get R-devel up and running with 
64-bit compilation on our PowerPC cluster. We've got the base install to 
compile with the following flags:

LDFLAGS=-m64 FFLAGS="-m64 -mpowerpc64" FCFLAGS="-m64 -mpowerpc64" 
CFLAGS="-m64 -mpowerpc64" ../configure 
--prefix='/N/hd03/mkimpel/BigRed/R_HOME/R-devel/R-build' 
--x-libraries=/usr/X11R6/lib64

About 50% of my package installs are failing with a message similar to 
that below:

SpikeofOneArray.o' is incompatible with powerpc:common64 output
make: *** [CALIB.so] Error 1

My sysAdmin suggested removing the -mpowerpc64 bit flag if I encountered 
problems, but I though I would run this past our wizards to see if 
anyone had experience with this problem before recompiling.

The conditional have to be a single element:
 > ?"if"

 cond: A length-one logical vector that is not 'NA'. Conditions of
          length greater than one are accepted with a warning, but only
          the first element is used.  Other types are coerced to
          logical if possible, ignoring any class.

In your case you have a matrix of logical values:
 > distance.matrix <= 58.1
     1     2     3
1 TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
2 TRUE  TRUE FALSE
3 TRUE FALSE  TRUE

A possible solution (maybe not the better):

Cov.f <- function(h, sigmasq, phi) {
    Cij <- h
    Cij[h<=phi] <- sigmasq * (1 - ( 1.5 * (Cij[h<=phi]/phi) - 0.5 
*(Cij[h<=phi]/phi)^3))
    Cij[h>phi] <- 0
    return(Cij)
}

You can always make a loop (V1 corresponds to column
1, etc.) but as.matrix() is simpler, i.e. in your case

data.matrix <- as.matrix(data)

I meant the version of Hmisc, but that should be fine too. Anyway, on
my installation the definition of xYplot looks fine (and works for
your example):

> xYplot
function (formula, data = sys.frame(sys.parent()), groups, subset,
    xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL, ylim = NULL, panel = panel.xYplot,
    prepanel = prepanel.xYplot, scales = NULL, minor.ticks = NULL,
    ...)
{

[...]

    do.call("xyplot", c(list(x = formula, data = data, prepanel = prepanel,
        panel = panel), if (length(ylab)) list(ylab = ylab),
        if (length(ylim)) list(ylim = ylim), if (length(xlab))
list(xlab = xlab),
        if (length(scales)) list(scales = scales), if
(length(minor.ticks)) list(minor.ticks = minor.ticks),
        if (!missing(groups)) list(groups = groups), if
(!missing(subset)) list(subset = subset),
        list(...)))
}
<environment: namespace:Hmisc>


If you see the same thing, in particular for the

    do.call("xyplot", c(list(x = formula, data = data,

part, then I don't have a solution for your problem.

What do you mean by IID tests?

You certainly can create sequences of iid
variables/vectors in R (see ?rnorn, ?runif, ?mvrnorm
from package MASS, etc.).

This will get the labels on the points, but you need a way to avoid
overlapping labels. And the xyplot is not maintaining the lines and grouping
in this new arrangement.

panel1 = function(x, y) {
     panel.xyplot(x, y)
     panel.text(PointsInTime, MeanScore,
          labels=round(MeanScore, digits=2), pos=2, offset=0.8)
     }

xyplot(MeanScore ~ PointsInTime, data=stuff, groups=cat, type='o',
        xlab = "Points in Time", ylab = "Mean Score", aspect = 0.7,
        auto.key = list(points = TRUE, lines = TRUE, space = "right"),
        panel=panel1)

(I had been meaning to reply, but it slipped my mind.)

I can't see an easy way to do this for persp, but it's technically
possible (though not a one-liner) for cloud and wireframe. I can look
into it if you think it will help.

Teodor --

Nice question! I don't think there is anything exactly like you are
looking for.

One problem is that in general R function arguments (and return
values) are not typed (!) and of course saying in the docs that a
function takes a particular type of argument is no guarantee that is
the case. A solution is to provide typing (e.g., via the TypeInfo
package in Bioconductor) or to restrict yourself to S4 methods (for
which at least some arguments are typed, though not generally return
values [though I believe they could be specified]).

A very different approach would recognize that R function arguments
are S-expressions of different types (raw, logical, character, int,
double, etc). Marking up R functions in XML then becomes the task of
(a) representing S-expressions or at least their content appropriately
(e.g., an important feature is to allow for NA; see StatDataML), (b)
identifying, perhaps on the fly since new packages are made available
all the time, functions to be exposed (with, e.g., 'get' and the
appropriate 'mode' argument), (c) determining the untyped signature
via 'formals', (d) creating an appropriate map between the (untyped)
signature and the XML representation of (a). This would mark up R
functions in XML without strong typing (i.e., with the level of type
specification currently available to R users!), but still seems,
naively, to be do-able.

I think it's worth asking whether you really want to expose 'all of R'
to C#, because this has significant security consequences (in a server
kind of environment) in addition to implicitly requiring use of the R
language semantics and evaluation model, and without some careful
thought needless movement of data across the R/C# boundary.

Mostly speculative ideas here, so please edit accordingly. Followup
definitely belongs in R-devel, where you might get some much more
informed input.

Others might suggest less exciting solutions, like (D)COM-based
packages referenced on the 'Other', packages, and FAQs links of the R
home page.

One can also do:

and examine x[528] (or x[529] - depending on whether
line 528 was line 528 of the file or line 528 after

  If I find time I might try to hack persp to do the grids
internally.

  thanks ...

Subject: [R] Rd files with unknown encoding?
Message-ID: <4760AFED.5050908@pdf.com>


      How can I identify the problem generating a warning in R CMD check 
for "Rd files with unknown encoding"? 

      Google identified an email from John Fox with a reply from Brian 
Ripley about this last 12 Jun 2007.  This suggests that I may have 
accidentally entered some possibly non-printing character into the 
offending Rd file.  The message tells me which file, but I don't know 
which lines in the file.  Is there some way of finding the offending 
character(s) without laboriously running R CMD check after deleting 
different portions of the file until I isolate the problem? 

      Thanks,
      Spencer Graves

Kevin,

To add to what Uwe Ligges wrote, your model is modeling chirps as a function of temp.  It looks like you are trying to turn that around and use chirps to predict a temp.  predict() won't do that.  Check any introductory regression text of why you probably don't want to do that anyway.  If you want to predict temp from chirps you should run

temp.lm <- lm(temp ~ chirps)
predict(temp.lm, newdata=data.frame(chirps=18))

The slope and intercept will be different from that found in chirps.res (in the absence of a perfect correlation between chirps and temp).

Hope this is helpful,

Dan

Subject: [R]  ggplot2: can not find "current.grobTree()"
Message-ID: <14310411.post@talk.nabble.com>


Dear All (and Hadley),

Is the function "current.grobTree()" implemented in ggplot2? According to
the draft ggplot2 book, on page 43, we can get a list of all grobs with
current.grobTree(). But when I try that, I get 'Error: could not find
function "current.grobTree"'.

However, when I try help(current.grobTree), I do get a "fake" document.

Best Regards

Dear Caroline

> How could I adjust this to function with the "negbin" function?
> Specifically, what would I use for the required "random" term?

The random argument is used to specify either a global parameter "phi" (random = ~ 1) or specific parameters "phi" for the levels of a given group factor (random = ~ group) (see ?negbin for what represents "phi" in negbin: Var[y] = ? + phi * ?^2)

In your example, it shoud be: negbin(formula = ..., random = ~ 1, data = ...)

Note that if your model has too many parameters, negbin may fail to reach the MLE.

You also can try the package 'gamlss' on CRAN. For your example, you can use the function gamlss as follows:

fm <- gamlss(formula = ..., family = NBI, sigma.formula = ~ 1, data = ...)
summary(fm)

ML

Subject: [R] [Not R question] using java COM bridge to pass array of double
 through R(D)COM SetSymbol method
Message-ID: <e1c1cf023ad79.4760cc63@optonline.net>

Hi 

My apology as I am really getting stuck. I know that this is not appropriate to post here but I do not know where to turn to. In any case, any thoughts or experience that you could share would be really appreciated.

I have a need to use java to access R on windows. And I need to spawn each R process for each of my subtask in java application. That's why Rserve would not be the right tool (as far as I read on their web site). So I am left with R(D)COM.

I use java COM bridge like j-integra and JACOB. My problem is that I cannot pass array of double through its proxy. Somehow, pass something like:

proxy.setSymbol("test", new double[] {2, 4});

this will work. but if I do

proxy.setSymbol("test", new double[] {2.0, 4.0});

this won't work.  Nor proxy.setSymbol("test", new Object[] {2.0,4.0}); 

So I'm quite desperate about the setSymbol. I'm sure that some of you might have write wrapper around R and might be able to provide me some insight. Thank you so much in advance.

Hi Wayne,

I'm assuming that you file is really a comma-separated file (*.csv) and 
not an Excel workbook (*.xls) saved with a .csv extension, right?  That 
(in my experience) is a common mistake.
You should open your file with a simple text editor (notepad will do if 
the file is not too large) and review line 528, instead of reviewing the 
spreadsheet in Excel.  You should be able to spot the problem right away.

This is one case where reading the actual R code is easier that 
explaining what it does.  From cut.default

    if (length(breaks) == 1) {
        if (is.na(breaks) | breaks < 2)
            stop("invalid number of intervals")
        nb <- as.integer(breaks + 1)
        dx <- diff(rx <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE))
        if (dx == 0)
            dx <- rx[1]
        breaks <- seq.int(rx[1] - dx/1000, rx[2] + dx/1000, length.out = nb)
    }

so basically it takes the range, extends it a bit and splits in into 
<breaks> equally long segments.

(For the sometimes more attractive option of splitting into groups of 
roughly equal size, there is cut2 in the Hmisc package, or use quantile())

cut(data, breaks=n)
splits the data in n bins of (approximately) the same size.

The used size is obtained by:
max(data) - min(data)
------------------------------------
                 n

 > x=rnorm(x)

 [1] (1.79,9.97]  (-6.39,1.79] (9.97,18.2]  (9.97,18.2]  (-6.39,1.79]

I don't know the reasons for the little differences (I am wondering about).
I hope it is useful.

Subject: [R] use ggplot in a function to which a column name is given
Message-ID: <6C8569E6-BE75-44C6-862D-00F5082DADF9@gmail.com>

Hi everyone, Hi ggplot users in particular,

ggplot makes it very easy to plot things given their names when you  
use it interactively (and therefore can provide the names of the  
columns).
	qplot(x,foo,data=A) where A has columns (x,y,foo,bar) for example

but I would like to use this from inside a function to which the name  
of the column is given. I cannot find an elegant way to make this  
work. Here are my attempts:

#------------------------------------------------------------

library(ggplot2)

A = data.frame(x=rep(1:10,10), y=rep(1:10,each=10), u=runif(100),  
v=rnorm(100))

# goal: extract values for y<=5 and plot them, either for u or v

foo1 <- function(uv="u")
{
	# solution 1: do not use the data argument at all
	# 	(forces the use of qplot, could be more elegant)
	B = A[A$y<=5,]
	qplot(B$x, B$y, fill=B[[uv]], geom="tile")
}

foo2 <- function(uv="u")
{
	# solution 2: extract and rename the colums, then use the data argument
	# 	(enables ggplot but could be shorter)
	B = A[A$y<=5,c("x","y",uv)]
	names(B)[3] = "value"
	# rem: cannot use rename since rename(B,c(uv="value")) would not work
	qplot(x, y, fill=value, data=B, geom="tile")
	# or
	# ggplot(B,aes(x=x,y=y,fill=value)) + geom_tile()
}

foo3 <- function(uv="u")
{
	# solution 3: use the data argument and perform the extraction  
directly in it
	#	(elegant and powerful but can't make it work)
	ggplot(A[A$y<=5,c("x","y",uv)],aes(x=x,y=y,fill=???)) + geom_tile()
	# or
	ggplot(A[A$y<=5,],aes(x=x,y=y,fill=???)) + geom_tile()
	# or ...	
}

print(foo1("u"))
print(foo1("v"))
print(foo2("u"))
print(foo3("u"))

#------------------------------------------------------------

Any help in making foo3 work would be appreciated. Thanks in advance  
for your expertise.

To avoid extra clutter I have deleted the rather long question which 
is obtainable from
https://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help//2007-December/147754.html

I received a very helpful response off-list the gist of which I 
summarise below. Since it was off-list I have removed the attribution.

S Poetry might help you.  I believe that it does answer
why the answer to Q5 is yes.  It doesn't matter what
argument name you choose -- just be consistent.
And of course S Poetry is available from:

---> actually this does not even work currently:
	Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : object "B" not found
Which only leaves the most inelegant solution: 2

But not on this list:

R-devel would have been more appropriate for this too.

I did say so in that thread:

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2007-June/046061.html

You can do much the same in R via iconv("", "C", sub="byte"), provided you 
can read the file in (it may not be representable in your current 
locale, but you could run R in a Latin-1 locale, if your OS has one).

Subject: [R] Flushing (Reset) 'last.warning'
Message-ID: <47611776.1090001@gmail.com>

Dear members of the mailing list,

I want to fetch warnings() from a series of prop.test calls. I want to
get "none" if no warning is issued, and "warning" if there is a problem.

I have looked (and relooked) at options(warn) and warning(), warnings()
and 'last.warning' but to no avail. I am a biologist, so the "R language
areas" are hard to fully understand.

I cannot flush the warnings before each prop.test calls; hence if there
is no warning, instead of "" I get (obviously) the last.warning from the
previous call. I tried to remove 'last.warning' but it won't let me
(wisely?) touch the base environment.

Code below. And if anyone could give some pointers it would be great.

Thank you, kind list
###############
collect <- vector('character', 3)
vec.1 <- c(10,19); total.1 <- c(24,35)
vec.2 <- c(5,12); total.2 <- c(50,211)

prop.test(vec.1, total.1); collect[1] <- names(warnings())
prop.test(vec.2, total.2); collect[2] <- names(warnings())
prop.test(vec.1, total.1); collect[3] <- names(warnings())

collect
[1] ""
[2] "Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect"
[3] "Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect"

I wanted
[1] ""
[2] "Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect"
[3] ""

One workaround:  when you want to clear the old warning, issue a blank 
one.  For example:

warning("")
prop.test(vec.1, total.1); collect[1] <- names(warnings())
warning("")
prop.test(vec.2, total.2); collect[2] <- names(warnings())
warning("")
prop.test(vec.1, total.1); collect[3] <- names(warnings())

This puts a lot of spurious lines like

Warning message:
 
into your output; you might prefer to use text like "Resetting warning 
message" instead of a blank.

A smooth of `disbinary' doesn't really make sense. It should enter the 
model parametrically. The problem is easy to see in 1D. Consider the 
model
y_i = f(x_i) + error_i
where `f' is a smooth function. If x_i only takes the values 0 and 1 
then you really don't have much of a basis for estimating f.

Hi Hadley,

Thanks for the help.

I found the problem. In the code you sent me earlier to correct the 
scale_y_continuous,  (below) the parameter is "limits", rather than 
"limit", as you write it. If I run my code without introducing the 
change you sent me, it works, but if I first correct it, then I have 
to use the changed spelling.

Thanks again,
Pedro
PS: If you care to explain: why do all parameters in the code below 
have a "." before the name, except precisely "limits"? I know it has 
to do with "proto", but could not find out why this one was different.

=================
[...] The fix will be included in the next version of
ggplot, or you can fix the current version by running this code:

ScaleContinuous$new <- function(., name=NULL, limits=c(NA,NA),
breaks=NULL, labels=NULL, variable, trans="identity", expand=c(0.05,
0)) {
     if (is.null(breaks) && !is.null(labels)) stop("Labels can only be
specified in conjunction with breaks")

     .$proto(name=name, .input=variable, .output=variable,
limits=limits, .breaks = breaks, .labels = labels, .expand=expand)
   }

try something like this:

combn(LETTERS[1:3], 2, paste, collapse = "")


I hope it helps.

Hi,

I try to make a plot like this:

Y |
  |
  |               o  
  |         o        o
  |     o               o

  |--------------------------------
   0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 (A)
 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0   (B)

or
		B
  100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0
Y |--------------------------------
  |
  |               o

  |--------------------------------
   0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
		A

A and B are complementary variables.

How is the best way to make this plot?

Thanks
Ronaldo

Plot Y versus A, then use the axis() function to add another axis and 
mtext to label it.  For example,

Y <- rnorm(101)
A <- 0:100
plot(A, Y)
B <- 100-A
ticks <- pretty(B)
axis(side=3, at=100-ticks, labels=ticks)
mtext("B", side=3, line=3)

You may need to adjust par(mar=) to get large enough margins for some 
more elaborate versions.

one way is the following:

str <- c('aaa bbb', 'cc', 'd eee aa', 'mmm o n')
sapply(strsplit(str, " "), "[", 1)


I hope it helps.

Hi,

if you only want the first word, then this should do the trick :

R> sub( " +.*", "", str )
[1] "aaa" "cc"  "d"   "mmm"

Cheers,

Romain

Good afternoon Monica,

Relying on regular expressions, substituting nothing "" for everything
starting with a space until the end of the "line" (i.e. with a dollar sign) 

str1 <- sub(" .*$", "", str)

Regards,
Sean

You need to define 'word' and 'first'.  Your solution says the first word 
of " aa" is "", which is not what most people would think.

I don't see how you got your answer: R does not print like that (and never 
has).

Code as before, but without the par statement, and using Axis(side=3, ...)

Subject: [R]  ls() pattern
Message-ID: <14316765.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello everyone,

I get some data in the following format and I would like to combine them to
form a dataframe. 

The data is like:

cbcname1 = 0.1,
cbcname2= 0.2,
cbcname3=0.3,...

name1, name2, name2 are just some random names. I would like to achieve sth
like:
(cbcname1=0.1, cbcname2=0.2, cbcname3=0.3,......)

I am using the following codes
do.call(cbind, ls(pat=paste("cbc",*,"=")))

But it seems like the ls() part does not work. 

Could anyone give me some advice? Many thanks.

There is probably a better way but something like this
should do it for your second version.

aa <- 1:20
bb <-  c(5,10,15,20 )
cc <- c(25, 50, 75, 100)
plot(aa)
axis(side=3, labels=cc, at=bb)

Subject: [R] How to use R to estimate a model which has two sets of

If you don't need a complex error structure then the dyn package
(and also the dynlm package) can do it. Using R's builtin
EuStockMarkets time series:

library(dyn)

z <- as.zoo(EuStockMarkets)
mod1 <- dyn$lm(DAX ~ lag(DAX, -(1:2)) + lag(FTSE, -(0:2)), z)
mod1

# compare to model without FTSE
mod2 <- dyn$lm(DAX ~ lag(DAX, -(1:2)), z)
anova(mod2, mod1)

Hello Michael,

you can use the function dynlm() contained in the CRAN-package with the
same name, or you can use the function VAR() contained in the package
vars. Here, you would only need the lm-object belonging to X_T as
lhs-variable.

Best,
Bernhard

Not really - I started off with the convention that variables should
start with a . to distinguish them from functions of the same name.
Unfortunately I forgot about the convention later on, so the code is a
bit confusing!

(And sorry for the confusion of limit vs. limits)

Hi Jiho,

The key to solving this problem is to use aes_string instead of aes.
Instead of the complicated munging that aes does to get the names of
the variables, aes_string works directly with strings, so that:

aes_string(x = "mpg", y = "wt") == aes(x = mpg, y = wt)

So your function would look like:

foo4 <- function(uv="u") {
  ggplot(A, aes_string(x = "x", y= "y", fill = uv)) + geom_tile()
}

Or

ggplot(A, aes(x=x, y=y)) + aes_string(fill=uv) + geom_tile()

Hope that helps!  (And I've made a note to better document aes_string
so you can discover after looking at aes)

Ooops - the book is now out of date.  Paul Murrell was kind enough to
write a much nicer version called grid.ls - use that instead

I deleted the file zzz.R from the R subdirectory which contained the following:

## startup file for clValid package
#.First.lib <- function(libname, pkgname, where) {
#  if( !require(methods) ) stop("we require methods for package clValid")
#  where <- match(paste("package:", pkgname, sep=""), search())
#  .initClValid(where)
#}

and the problem went away.  I'm not sure, though, why this would have any effect ...

Anyway, problem solved!

Dear all, 
I am encountering a cyclic dependency error when running R CMD check on an R package I wrote (R version 2.6.1, Mac OS X 10.4), see the error message below.    

Creating a new generic function for "print" in "clValid"
Creating a new generic function for "summary" in "clValid"
Creating a new generic function for "plot" in "clValid"
Error in loadNamespace(package, c(which.lib.loc, lib.loc), keep.source = keep.source) : 
        cyclic name space dependencies are not supported
Error : package/namespace load failed for 'clValid'
Error: unable to load R code in package 'clValid'
Execution halted
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package 'clValid'
** Removing '/Users/guybrock/Documents/projects/DattaPackages/Cluster/clValid_0.5-4.Rcheck/clValid'


The NAMESPACE file is below,

.onLoad <- function(lib, pkg) require(methods)
importFrom(graphics, plot)
exportClasses(clValid)
exportMethods(clusters, clusterMethods, nClusters, measNames, measures, optimalScores, plot, print, show, summary)
S3method(print,sota)
S3method(plot,sota)
export(clValid, sota, dunn, connectivity, BHI, BSI, stability, matchGO)

My question is - how can I locate the source of the cyclic dependency error?  This is an updated version of a package which did not previously have this error, so somehow I introduced this in the modifications I made.  Note that R CMD check on Windows (R version 2.6.0) doesn't catch this, although R CMD build --binary fails on Windows with the same error.   

Thanks,
Guy

Try this:

unlist(mget(ls(pattern="cbc"), envir=.GlobalEnv))

The output is an array rather than a data frame, but so would be the 
output from cbind.

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] New version of seqinR  released
Message-ID: <475FF73E.8080606@biomserv.univ-lyon1.fr>

Dear useRs,

the seqinR package contains utilities to import and analyze biological
sequence data. For a general introduction see this document:
http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/SeqinR//vignette.pdf

Please do not use r-help for questions about seqinR or r-bugs
for bug report about seqinR. Use instead the seqinR diffusion list:
http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/SeqinR//mailing.php?lang=eng

A new version of seqinR, seqinR 1.1-4, has been released on CRAN.
Here is a summary of changes:

o There is a new chapter to explain how to set up a
  local ACNUC server on Unix-like platforms.

o Function GC() has gained a new argument NA.GC
  defaulting to NA to say what should be returned when the
  GC content cannot be computed from data (for instance with a
  sequence like NNNNNNNNNNNN). The argument oldGC is now
  deprecated and a warning is issued. Functions GC1(),
  GC2(), GC3() are now simple wrappers for the
  more general GCpos() function. The new argument frame
  allows to take the frame into account for CDS.

o Function read.fasta() now supports comment lines
  starting by a semicolon character in FASTA files. An example
  of such a file is provided in sequences/legacy.fasta.
  The argument File is now deprecated. There is
  a new argument seqonly to import just the sequences
  without names, annotations and coercion attempts. There is
  a new argument strip.desc to remove the leading
  '>' character in annotations (as in function readFASTA
  from the Biostrings package). The FASTA file
  example someORF.fsa from Biostrings is also added
  for comparisons.

o Function read.alignment() has gained a new argument
  forceToLower defaulting to TRUE to force lower case in
  the character of the sequence (this is for a smoother interaction
  with the package ape). The argument File is now
  deprecated and a warning is issued when used instead of file.
  The example in the function kaks() has been corrected
  to avoid this warning when reading the example files.

o The details of the socket connection are no more stored in
  the slot socket for objects of class seqAcnucWeb:
  this slot is now deleted. As a consequence, the argument
  socket in function as.SeqAcnucWeb() has been
  removed and there is now a new
  argument socket = "auto" in functions getAnnot(),
  getFrag(), geyKeyword(), getLocation(),
  and getSequence(). The default value "auto" means
  that the details of the socket connection are taken automatically
  when necessary from the last opened bank. The size of local lists
  of sequences is reduced by about a third now as compared to the
  previous version.

o New dataset m16j and waterabs added.

o Generic functions getAnnot(), getFrag(), getKeyword(),
  getLength(), getLocation(), getName(), getSequence() and
  getTrans() have gained methods to handle objects from class list
  and class qaw.

o Functions getAttributsocket() and getNumber.socket()
  are now deprecated, a warning is issued.

o There is a new appendix in which all the examples protected
  by a dontrun statment are forced to be executed.

o New low level utility functions related to an ACNUC server:
  acnucclose(), quitacnuc(), clientid(), countfreelists(),
  knowndbs(), autosocket(), countsubseqs(), savelist(),
  ghelp(), modifylist(), getlistate(), setlistname(),
  residuecount(), isenum(), prettyseq(), gfrag(),
  print.seqAcnucWeb()

o Utility function parser.socket() has been optimized and
  is about four times faster now. This decreases the time
  needed by the query() function.

Best,

the seqinR team

great! I knew you would have thought this through. That's perfect. As  
always there's the trade-off between writing code and documenting the  
code already written. In this case the trade-off turned toward the  
code part I guess.

Autodetection of strings by aes would be even greater but that would  
prevent me to assign the actual strings "u", "x", "y" to an aes  
element, which I don't see as a problem for non text related functions  
though...

Thanks again.

It can come in handy when combining multiple datasets:

mtcarsq <- as.data.frame(mtcars ^ 2)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=mpg, y=wt)) + geom_point(aes(colour = "Raw")) +
geom_point(aes(colour="Squared"), data=mtcarsq)

and aes is complicated enough as it is.

This sounds like a different problem.  Do you mean that you want to 
automatically generate variable names and assign something to the 
resultant strings?

May I suggest you read the FAQ on R, 7.21 "How can I turn a string into a 
variable?"

Richie.

Subject: [R] RMySQL with Xampp could never work?
Message-ID: <476162DC.3040807@caspur.it>

Hello everybody, i had a big issue with RMySQL,
working on an installation of R on multiple nodes via net file-system.

The point is that we installed Xampp as suite for mysql, perl, apache 
and php on every node, and we need to use R scripts with mysql.
Xampp doesn't compile anything, it gives you pre-compiled binaries all 
linked together, you just extract from a tarball.

At my first try, RMySQL could not find where mysql stuff was.
There are a few mentions of this problem in google, so i  defined the 
LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS environment variable, and then set the PKG_CPPFLAGS 
and PKG_LIBS environment variables as well.
After this the installation with the "R CMD INSTALL" went fine, but then 
trying to load the library:
/> library(RMySQL)/
unable to load shared library:
RMySQL.so: undefined symbol: mysql_field_count

The command "ldd RMySQL.so" showed that the shared object was not 
pointing to libmysqlclient.so in the Xampp directory.
I tried to modify /etc/ld.so.conf adding Xampp directory, running again 
ldconfig, still same problem.

The only way to have it work was installing on one node the RPM of the 
shared library for Mysql 4.1.
On that machine i installed RMySQL and finally RMySQL.so was pointing to 
libmysqlclient.so.14, and loading the library was successful.

But the funny thing is that now that RMySQL.so works fine on the other 
nodes, without requiring the rpm installation,
i just need to specify the xampp mysql socket address (different from 
the standard /var/mysql) when i use dbConnect.

Is this RMySQL going to work one day on Xampp?
Does anybody know the reason why you cannot specify to RMySQL where 
libmysqlclient should be?

Thanks
Paolo

See  ?as.Date : strptime() does not produce Dates.

Also, ?read.csv says there is an argument

colClasses: character.  A vector of classes to be assumed for the
           columns.  Recycled as necessary, or if the character vector
           is named, unspecified values are taken to be 'NA'.

           Possible values are 'NA' (when 'type.convert' is used),
           '"NULL"' (when the column is skipped), one of the atomic
           vector classes (logical, integer, numeric, complex,
           character, raw), or '"factor"', '"Date"' or '"POSIXct"'.

Ok.  How's this?

#Generate variable names
varnames = paste("cbcname", 1:10, sep="")
#Assign them to values
for(i in 1:10) assign(varnames[i], 0.1*i)
#Form the middle bit of the command
cmd = paste(varnames, "=", mget(varnames, envir=.GlobalEnv), collapse=",")
#Evaluate the command
eval(parse(text=paste("df=data.frame(", cmd, ")", sep="")))

There's a general rule that says if you have to use parse, you're probably 
doing it the wrong way, but it's been a long day, so that's the best way I 
can think of right now.

Hello

Is there an easy way, i.e. a function in a package, to calculate the
area under the curve (AUC) for drug serum levels?

Thanks for any advice

Hi all, 

does anyone know of a package/function for fitting Vector Autoregressive
Moving Average models? I looked through most of the packages available but
could only find functions to fit a VAR. 

Any help would be appreciated!

Thank you for the reply.  With the improved formula, mvpart worked like a charm.

rpart doesn't do multiple responses - try package mvpart for a drop-in
replacement. Alternatively look at package party.

Also, you are not using formula correctly. What you should have written
is:

prey.data ~ Clength, data = turtle.data

What R does is look for variables in the formula from within the data
argument, and IIRC data is supposed to be a data frame. If it doesn't
find what it needs in data, it looks in the workspace. This probably
isn't correct - the real answer having to do with environments and
parents etc., but effectively in this case this is what happens.

Of course, it has to expand . from data and prey.data is a data frame. R
picks up turtle.data$Clength from the workspace. But this isn't a
multivariate tree. You are confusing the problem above with not being
able to deal with multiple responses.

If mvpart is not working then you need to show why and how it fails.
>From your description, the response is abundances of prey species, this
should be fine in mvpart.

Note though, that mvpart seems to need a data.matrix as the response so
something like this should work:

data.matrix(prey.data) ~ Clength, data = turtle.data

Friends: I wish to overlay data points on a contour graph.  The following

I should say that the name of this chart varies even among 
Spanish-speaking countries.  In Argentina is "diagrama de torta" which 
is something like "cake-chart".

Hi Seth,

An alternative would be to use ggplot2, http://had.co.nz/ggplot2:

model <- function(a,b,c,X1,X2)  {
  (exp(a + b*X1 + c*X2)) / (1 + exp(a + b*X1 + c*X2))
}

g <- expand.grid(X1 = seq(0.40, 0.8,0.01), X2 = seq(0.03,0.99,0.03))
a <- -37.61
b <- 34.88
c <- 28.44
g$z<- model(a, b, c, g$X1,g$X2)

ph <-c(0.42,0.47,0.59,0.40)
phh <-c(0.76,0.81,0.82,0.71)
d <- data.frame(ph,phh)

library(ggplot2)
qplot(X1, X2, data = g, fill = z, geom="tile", xlab="p(H)", ylab="p(H|H)")+
 geom_contour(aes(z=z)) +
 geom_point(aes(x = ph, y = phh, fill = NULL), data=d)

Plots in ggplot2 have multiple layers which can have different data sources.

 Very nice, thanks for introducing me to a new resource. I will include the
entire, functioning example in the event others may find it useful.

You may want to check package dlm and, possibly, dse. 

In dlm you can cast a VARMA model in state space form (dlmModARMA) and
estimate unknown parameters by maximum likelihood (dlmMLE).

Subject: [R] Calculating Rsquared values in rpart
Message-ID: <BAY127-W24D76891A88364C2ACFD93DE660@phx.gbl>


Hi there

In rpart, one can get a graph of R-squared (using rsq.rpart (fit)), in which the x axis is the number of splits, and which contains two lines - an "apparent" R squared and an Rsquared based on the x error.

I would like to caclulate these R-squared values, but cannot work out from the output how it is done. Is there any way to access the values that underpin this graph? Alternatively, is there any way to calculate them from the summary data?

Thanks in advance,

Andy Park

Beware.  Yi in his JASA paper about generalized degrees of freedom 
showed that to get an unbiased estimate of R^2 from recursive 
partitioning you have to use the formula for adjusted R^2 with number of 
parameters far exceeding the number of final splits.  He showed how to 
estimate the d.f.   Recursive partitioning seems to result in simple 
prediction models but this is mainly an illusion.

Hi,

Is there a R library (code) to calculate Average Precision?
I have been using ROCR to calculate other measure like AUC, F-measure etc.
But ARP (average precision) was not available although it provides
precision/recall.

I am almost sure that someone already implemented it.

Hi all,

    I have a quick question, I want to send a select statement to the 
mysql server. With the code below I connect and ask my select statement.
As you can see from the code I want to have a mode = "+". The '+' needs 
to be free text and hence the "\"" around it. But it doesn't work. If i 
put just plus in instead of the 'mode' I get a table. How can I give the 
'select' statement a variable and put it in free text ?

cheers,

Subject: [R] convergence error code in mixed effects models
Message-ID: <580233.74151.qm@web26210.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Dear All,
I want to analyse treatment effects with time series
data:  I measured e.g. leaf number (five replicate
plants) in relation to two soil pH - after 2,4,6,8
weeks. I used mixed effects models, but some analyses
didn?t work. It seems for me as if this is a randomly
occurring problem since sometimes the same model works
sometimes not.

An example:
> names(test)
[1] "rep"    "treat"  "leaf"   "week"  
> library (lattice)
> library (nlme)
> test<-groupedData(leaf~week|rep,outer=~treat,test)
> model<-lme(leaf~treat,random=~leaf|rep)
Error in lme.formula(leaf~ treat, random = ~week|rep)
: 
        nlminb problem, convergence error code = 1;
message = iteration limit reached without convergence
(9)

Has anybody an idea to solve this problem?
Thanks

Really!? You gave lme a model with random = ~ leaf | rep (and no data
specification) and it tried to fit a model with random = ~ week | rep?
Are you sure that is an exact transcript?

Oh, I have lots of ideas but without a reproducible example I can't
hope to decide what might be the problem.

It appears that the model may be over-parameterized.  Assuming that
there are 4 different values of week then ~ week | rep requires
fitting 10 variance-covariance parameters. That's a lot.
The error code indicates that the optimizer is taking

Subject: [R] Different display of same graphs on different screens
Message-ID: <615767.13284.qm@web34708.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear R-experts,

   I need to run a R code on different computers (MACs
and PCs) on different monitos sizes. The code
generates graphs that are displayed in the same page.
But there are some elements of the graphs that appear
at the right position on a PC, but they don't appear
at all when I run it on a MAC. I have R v 2.5.1
installed in both types of systems.

  I specify windows(height=10, width=10) at the
beggining of the code.

I am guessing it has to do with devices, but I am not
sure what to specify.

Thank you,

Judith

how are you specifying the size on the macs? 

quartz(height=10, width=10)

Yea that worked !!
Did
paste(SELECT * FROM MET WHERE molid=", molid, "AND mode=", "\'" mode, 
"\'" , sep="")
I guess all I needed was the sep="" which I totally forgot about.

If your data are continuous with exact zeros, and contain a lot of 
zeros, no transformation may help.  You simply map a stack of zeros 
to some other value.  Box--Cox transforms are not really designed 
for this.

If your data really is continuous with exact zeros, other options 
exist such as hurdle models, Tweedie glms (package  tweedie) and so 
forth.

If you're comfortable with Python (or Perl, Ruby etc), it'd be easier  
to just extract the required stuff from the raw feed - using  
ElementTree in Python makes this a trivial task

Once you have the raw data you can read it into R

Certainly - probably as a better Python programmer than an R  
programmer, it's faster and neater for me to do it in Python:

from elementtree.ElementTree import XML
import urllib

url = 'http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/erss.cgi? 
rss_guid=0_JYbpsax0ZAAPnOd7nFAX-29fXDpTk5t8M4hx9ytT-'
con = urllib.urlopen(url)
dat = con.read()
root = XML(dat)
items = root.findall("channel/item")
for item in items:
     category = item.find("category")
     print category.text

The problem is that the RSS feed you linked to, does not contain the  
year of the article in an easily accessible XML element. Rather you  
have to process the HTML content of the description element - which,  
is something R could do, but you'd be using the wrong tool for the job.

In general, if you're planning to analyze article data from Pubmed  
I'd suggest going through the Entrez CGI's (ESearch and EFetch)   
which will give you all the details of the articles in an XML format  
which can then be easily parsed in your language of choice.

This is something that can be done in R (the rpubchem package  
contains functions to process XML files from Pubchem, which might  
provide some pointers)

Message-ID: <A9688B3789579A498D5CBF96EDBC9D0F011143C6@HERMES>

Under Windows, I have used RODBC to connect to Excel spreadsheets as per
the example below: 

library(RODBC);
connect = odbcConnectExcel("testdata.xls");
query = "SELECT [data$.ethn], [data$.sex], [data$.age], 
                [data$.height], [data$.weight], 
                [label$.label]
         FROM [data$], [label$] 
         WHERE [data$.ethn] = [label$.ethn];"
data = sqlQuery(connect, query);
odbcClose(connect);

[data$] and [label$] are two named sheets in the Excel spreadsheet
testdata.xls. [.ethn], [.sex], [.age], [.height], [.weight], and
[.label] are cloumn names that appear in the first row in the sheets. I
can also have UNION queries that allow me to overcome the spreadsheet
row limitation of a single sheet. The idea is to allow normalization of
data in a spreadsheet and leveraging the power of SQL, without using a
database. 

Can the same be done under Windows (Linux?) with OpenOffice Calc using
RJDBC? Are there ODBC drivers for OpenOffice Calc? 

I know that the right solution would be to use a database, but this is
outside the comfort zone of many users who rely mainly on spreadsheets
to collect, manipulate and analyze their data.

or just try looking in the annotate package from Bioconductor

This question is nothing to do with RODBC.

You need to study the rw-FAQ Q2.9: I believe you should be able to get up 
to (almost) 3GB on that system.  (BTW, you seem confused about units: I 
hope you have 3GB of RAM, where G means 1024^3.)

An awful lot of that is Microsoft warts on SQL, so it will not be 
portable.  But in a more standard syntax (drop the [] and $) it should be 
doable over any connection that supports SQL queries.

The question is whether OO calc has suitable drivers as an ODBC/JDBC 
server.  Not a question for this list!  (I suspect the answer is no: 
Microsoft's drivers effectively use the Access engine to work with 
spreadsheet files and even plain text.  I don't even see drivers for OO 
base.)

Well, numerically by re-writing

-29.040x+1 = 327.727x^(355.768x/(1-x))
0 = 327.727x^(355.768x/(1-x)) - (-29.040x+1)
0^2 = (327.727x^(355.768x/(1-x)) - (-29.040x+1))^2

and then minimizing the right hand side:

optimize(function(x)
         (327.727 * x^(355.768*x / (1-x)) - (-29.040*x + 1))^2,
     interval = c(0, 1))

I used the procedure described in Crawley?s new R

For two of the tree response variables
(heightfra,leaffra) it doesn?t work, while it worked
with leafvim (but in another R session, yesterday,
leaffra worked as well...).

Here the commands:

Hello,

I gather variants of this question have been asked previously. I have 
done some reading but only became more confused, as I suspect what I 
am trying to do is more basic than other applications.

The following code readily calculates the difference in days between two dates:

  newdays <- ISOdate(2005, 5,12) - ISOdate(2006, 12, 22)

However, I wanted to be able to deduct the dates in one variable from 
the dates in another variable, resulting in a new variable - e.g the 
difference in days between the two dates. Below is a sample of my 
data. My questions:

1. I tried changing the data to dates via as.Date. Is this necessary 
or do I need to alter the date format itself, e.g to 12/12/78 or some 
other format?
2. I gather there are various packages as well as date formats.What 
is the most straight forward approach to calculate the difference 
between two dates, as below.


 > dates <- read.csv("c:\\dates.csv",header=T)
 > dates
           v1         v2
1 12/12/1978 12/12/2005
2 23/01/1965 23/09/2001
3 24/12/2004 16/03/2007
4  3/03/2003  4/04/2004
5  8/11/2006  1/05/2007

 > class(dates$v1)
[1] "factor"
 > class(dates$v2)

 > dates <- read.csv("c:\\dates.csv",header=T,

Error: syntax error, unexpected STR_CONST, expecting ',' in "dates <-

Any assistance is much appreciated,

Bob

Subject: [R] Plot question
Message-ID: <47628227.8060104@nih.gov>

I have some data consisting of multiple trials of an experiment with 
different values of an independent variable.  If I run
R> plot(var,result)
I get a scatterplot of result versus the independent variable var.
If I run
R> plot(as.factor(var),result)
I get a boxplot of the distribution of result for each value of var.  In 
this plot, each boxplot is labeled by the corresponding value of var, 
but the absissas are evenly spaced.
Is it possible to generate a boxplot with the absissas of each boxplot 
equal to the corresponding value of var?

Subject: [R]  High Frequency Financial Calculations
Message-ID: <14327315.post@talk.nabble.com>


Does anyone know of a package for High Frequency Data analysis.
Particularly I'd like to find something over any of the following topics:
     ACD (Autoregressive Conditional Duration) - Engle
     HARCH - Muller
     UHF-GARCH (Ultra High Frequency GARCH) - Engle

thanks!

Hi,

I think this is a pretty basic question. I still couldn#t find the answer to 
it, though.

I have some data loaded into R, which looks like this:

> data()
...
38358     Advice      Article
38359     Advice      Article
38360    GeneralInfo  List
38361    GeneralInfo      Article
38362     Purchase   Paragraphs
38363     Purchase         List
38364     Purchase   Paragraphs
...


I now would like to edit the data in such a way that every "Advice" is 
changed into "GeneralInfo".
Is there some easy way how I can do this?

Thanks a lot!

There are none to my knowledge.  Most of OO.org's ODBC/JDBC integration
is one-way. That is, it can connect within the suite and to external
sources, but does not appear to provide connectivity to enable external
applications to acquire data stored within OO.org's apps.

Base is an embedded version of HSQLDB (http://www.hsqldb.org), which is
a java based application. In theory, it would support a JDBC interface,
but I have seen none and when the subject comes up on the OO.org lists,
no solutions are forthcoming. It's too bad, at least within this
context, that the OO.org folks elected to use HSQLDB rather than SQLite,
which was the the other option under consideration. Perhaps Sun's
influence, vis-a-vis Java, won the day here.

Bearing in mind that OO.org's Write and Calc documents are just 'zipped'
XML files, it would be possible to parse the data stored within such
documents. I suspect Max Kuhn has spent much time on this for odfWeave.

There are Perl modules that can provide a level of interaction here. For
example, OpenOffice::Parse::SXC
(http://search.cpan.org/~dclee/OpenOffice-Parse-SXC-0.03/SXC.pm)
provides the means to parse a Calc file directly, without needing the
OO.org API.

One could wrap that module in an R function via a system() call and then
interact with a Calc file directly.

Message-ID: <86b533e90712131113y3104de23x9028456d2f7d8466@mail.gmail.com>

Hello useRs,

MBESS (Methods for the Behavioral, Educational, and Social Sciences)
has recently been released and should be on all of the mirrors by now
(with binaries for Mac and Windows:
http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/MBESS.html).

The major contribution of MBESS is confidence intervals for
noncentrality parameters (t, F, and chi-square) and standardized
effect sizes (e.g., the standardized mean and mean difference, R^2 for
random or fixed effects, the coefficient of variation, the root mean
square error of approximation, standardized regression coefficients)
as well as sample size planning from the accuracy in parameter
estimation (AIPE) approach, where the width of the observed confidence
intervals is of interest (in addition to or instead of the power
analytic approach to sample size planning).

This is the 10th release of MBESS and it is version number is now 1.0.0.

Detailed information about MBESS is available in the current issue of
Behavior Research Methods
(http://www.psychonomic.org/BRMIC/contents.htm) as well as Journal of
Statistical Software (http://www.jstatsoft.org/v20/i08).

Take care,
Ken

This is a little tricky, because R has probably converted those columns 
into factors.  Let's assume that column 2 is named Type and the dataset 
is named dat.

Then you replace it as

dat$Type[dat$Type == "Advice"] <- "GeneralInfo"

You'd think the following would work:

dat$Type <- ifelse(dat$Type == "Advice", "GeneralInfo", dat$Type)

but it doesn't, because ifelse() loses the factor levels.  Factors are 
one of the most error-prone features of the S language.

I haven't played much with Calc, but it if the Calc file has formulas
or anything other than raw data, this would probably be a mess to
parse.

The first thing that I would try is to use command line tools (like
ooconvert or jodconverter) to convert the file to csv and then read it
in. These tools were written for Write documents, but they may also be
good at converting other types of od* documents.

Good luck,

Max

If you want boxplots, you could do something like this:

CV <- rnorm(100)
FV <- sample(c(1, 3, 6), 100, replace = TRUE)

boxplot(CV ~ factor(FV, levels = seq(max(FV))))


This essentially 'fills in' the missing values (levels) of the factor
variable so that they are included in the plot.

Hi Alan,

Yes it is, but you need to do a bit work.  There are different approaches. 
Look at the at= option under

?bxp

and draw your boxplots with something like:

boxplot(y ~ as.numeric(as.factor(grp)), at=c(0.5, 2, 2.5, 3), xaxt="n", ...)
axis(side=1, at=c(0.5, 2, 2.5, 3), labels=c("0.5","2","2.5","3"))

This should do it, and is perhaps the easiest route.  There may be something
missing, because I don't have a concrete example.  Anyhow, you should be
able to fill in the gaps.

HTH,

Mark.

Dear Prof. Ripley,

thanks very much for a quick and helpful response. In the last question 
I wanted to hint at
specARIMA which I am using to get the theoretical spectral density of an 
ARMA process.

This works very well in general, however, in a simple example

X_t=0.7*X_{t-1}+epsilon_t

I obtain a value 1.768253 for funscaled[1] ( the first Fourier frequency 
0.003141593)

using

str(f<-specARIMA(eta=c(H=0.5,phi=c(0.7),psi=c()),p=1,q=0,m=2000))
funscaled<-numeric(length(f$freq))
funscaled<-f$spec*f$theta1

where the theoretical value should be 0.901878 with

b<-0.7
omega<-0.003141593
1/(2*pi)*(1-b^2)/(1+b^2-2*b*cos(omega))
[1] 0.9018088


using the formula (2.40) in Fan and Yao, Nonlinear Time Series ( 
Springer 2003 ), page 54-55

Is there also a simple explanation for this ? am I overlooking something ?

Thanks and best regards,

Lieven Desmet,

The easiest way would be to use the HH package, which you can get from CRAN.

Marc's example is limited to integers on the X axis.  Using positioned(),
which is
an extension to ordered(), allows arbitrary values.  Building on that
example

require(HH)

CV <- rnorm(100)
FV <- sample(c(-1.4, 3.2, 5), 100, replace = TRUE)

bwplot(CV ~ positioned(FV))

Subject: [R] Plot question

I have some data consisting of multiple trials of an experiment with 
different values of an independent variable.  If I run
R> plot(var,result)
I get a scatterplot of result versus the independent variable var.
If I run
R> plot(as.factor(var),result)
I get a boxplot of the distribution of result for each value of var.  In 
this plot, each boxplot is labeled by the corresponding value of var, 
but the absissas are evenly spaced.
Is it possible to generate a boxplot with the absissas of each boxplot 
equal to the corresponding value of var?

hello, i'm having a problem creating a custom package.
i've found other posts on the web that describe a similar problem but i
haven't found any solution.  please advise.

the error in the build process is
checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... ERROR

my r source (in the file dlog.r)

dlog <- function(X,h=1) {
list(res=(as.matrix(diff(log(X),lag = h, differences = 1))), res2=h)

then

package.skeleton(name="DLOGPackage", list=ls(), .GlobalEnv,
"C:\\shaun\\projects\\rpackagecreation", TRUE)

2.  in the R install\bin directory i ran
rcmd build --force --binary --no-vignettes --docs=none

Subject: [R] train nnet
Message-ID: <bebd16360712140752l43a4ceb5xedb80f8bdc658f00@mail.gmail.com>

Hi R-helpers,

Can some one tell me how to train 'mynn' of this type?:
mynn <- nnet(y ~ x1 + ..+ x8, data = lgist, size = 2, rang = 0.1,
decay = 5e-4, maxit = 200)

I assume that this nn is untrained, and to train I have to split the
original data into train:test data set,
do leave-one-out refitting to refine the weights (please straighten
this up if I was wrong).

I just don't know how to do it in R. Is 'training' and
'training.reports' in (AMORE) able to do it?

Thank you for any light on this.

Subject: [R] How to convert Datetime numbers from Excel to POSIXt objects
Message-ID: <4762B82C.9040708@gepdata.ch>

Hi all,

I need to compare time series data files of different time formats. I 
had no problems with text format using strptime.
But how can I convert datetime numbers from Excel (days since 30.12.1899 
00:00:00) into POSIXt objects?
For example 29770.375 should be converted to  "03.07.1981 09:00:00"

I tried the following code and encountered strange results:

t1-t0 gives 29770.33 (should be 29770.375 in my opinion)
t1-t2 and t1-t3 are ok
t1-t4 gives 183.3333 (should be 183.375)
Are these rounding errors?

The R-code:

t1 <- strptime("3.7.1981 09:00:00","%d.%m.%Y %H:%M:%S")
t0 <- strptime("30.12.1899 00:00:00","%d.%m.%Y %H:%M:%S")
t2 <- strptime("3.7.1981 00:00:00","%d.%m.%Y %H:%M:%S")
t3 <- strptime("1.7.1981 00:00:00","%d.%m.%Y %H:%M:%S")
t4 <- strptime("1.1.1981 00:00:00","%d.%m.%Y %H:%M:%S")
t1 - t0
t1 - t2
difftime(t1,t2,units="days")
t1 - t3
t1 - t4

Thanks for any help or clarifications

nnet will estimate model parameters for the model that you have specified.

If you want to understand what parameters (e.g. size, decay) should be
used, the train function in the caret package uses a variety of
resampling methods to help pick those parameters (and will refit the
model based on that). There are similar functions in other packages
(like e1071).

Install the caret package and use vignette("caretTrain") to see the details.

So your expectation is off by 1/24th of a day.

Can you think of something that might affect time differences by that
amount, depending on which times of the year you are comparing?

Look at ?by and if that is not enough then look at the doBy package.  If
neither of those give you what you want, then give us more detail to
help you with.

Hope this helps,

I suspect that the data set in that run has 'issues'.  These might include 
having a near dependency among the regressors - at least when weighting as 
to form the likelihood. Perhaps, (some of) the data are separable or 
nearly so.

To get at this I would wrap the call in 'try' or one of its relatives and 
save out the data when the error is triggered to see what gives.

Another possibility is to run interaactively and set

 	options( error=recover )

to try to take things apart.

HTH,

Chuck

Since you are getting the date times from Excel clearly you don't need
time zones, etc. so you can use chron.  See R News 4/1 for more.

Subject: [R] Result depends on previous result; easy with a loop;
 but without a loop?
Message-ID: <4762B9B2.80704@gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am pretty sure that this has been discussed before. Unfortunately, I 
can not find anything in the archives -- probably because I am 
"RSiteSearching" for the wrong terms. If I remember correctly, I think I 
even asked this question a few years ago. But I cannot even find this.

The basic problem is that a result depends on a previous result. This is 
easy with a loop--but how can I do this without a loop?

Lets give an example:

initial.matrix <- rbind(rep(1,4), matrix(0,ncol=4,nrow=5))
the.other.matrix <- matrix(runif(20), ncol=4, nrow=5)

the initial matrix should be filled according to the following 
(pseudo-code) rule:
if (row==1) initial.matrix[1,] <- 1
if (row>1) initial.matrix[x,] <- initial.matrix[x-1,] * 
the.other.matrix[x-1,]

as I said this is easy to do with a loop:
for (i in 2:(nrow(initial.matrix))) {
   initial.matrix[i,] <- initial.matrix[i-1,]*the.other.matrix[i-1,]
}
initial.matrix

But how can I do this without a loop?

Thank you already in advance!
Roland

References for types of residuals, including partial residuals, are in the

Subject: [R] connecting RMySQL to and external server
Message-ID: <200712142055.15148.dusa.adrian@gmail.com>


Dear list,

I learned how to connect R to a local MySQL server, using:
drv <- dbDriver("MySQL")
con <- dbConnect(drv, user="root", password="mypass", dbname="mydb")

Is it possible to connect R in this way to an external server (on a different 
machine, with a different IP)?

I read the documentation on ?dbConnect (and everything I could find on the 
internet), but I failed to find some other relevant arguments. For example, 
one needs to first connect to the external machine and only after that to the 
MySQL server on that machine. Is this possible from within R?

Thank you in advance,
Adrian

Yes, you can also do this in dse, either in the ARMA specification or as

Roland,

You can test for the "sameness" of floating-point results as follows:

all.equal(initial.matrix, initial.matrix2)

By default, it uses a tolerance = .Machine$double.eps ^ 0.5 (roughly,
1.e-08).  You can decrease this if you want a more stringent test for
sameness.

all.identical(initial.matrix, initial.matrix2) 

This tests for "identicality", which, of course, is not appropriate for
floating point computations.

Ravi.

Yes. I have noticed that there two sorts of xml that pubmed will
provide. The kind I had hooked into was an rss feed which provides a
lot of the information simply as a formatted table for viewing in a
rss reader. There is another way to get the xml to come out with more
tags. However, I found the best way to do this is probably through the
bioconductor annotate package

x <- pubmed("18046565", "17978930", "17975511")
a <- xmlRoot(x)
numAbst <- length(xmlChildren(a))
absts <- list()
for (i in 1:numAbst) {
absts[[i]] <- buildPubMedAbst(a[[i]])
   }

I am now trying to work through that approach to see what I can come up with.

Yip. annotate seems to be the most streamlined way to do this.
1) How does one turn the list that is created into a dataframe whose
column names are along the lines of date, title, journal, authors etc
2) I have already created a standing search in pubmed using MyNCBI.
There are many ways I can feed those results to the pubmed() function.
The most brute force way of doing it is by running the search and
outputing the data as a UI List and getting that into the pubmed
brackets. A way that involved more finesse would allow me to create a
rss feed based on my search and then give the rss feed url to the
pubmed function. Or perhaps once could just plop the query inside the
pubmed functions
pubmed(somefunction("Laryngeal Neoplasms"[MeSH] AND "Papilloma"[MeSH])
OR ((("recurrence"[TIAB] NOT Medline[SB]) OR "recurrence"[MeSH Terms]
OR recurrent[Text Word]) AND respiratory[All Fields] AND
(("papilloma"[TIAB] NOT Medline[SB]) OR "papilloma"[MeSH Terms] OR
papillomatosis[Text Word])))

Does "somefunction" exist?

If there are any further questions do you think I should migrate this
conversation to the bioconductor mailing list?

Thank you for sending the data.  It is very helpful in understanding
the nature of the problem.

For example, in your original description of your study you referred
to week as a factor, which is a completely reasonable term, but I
mistakenly thought that you meant an object of class "factor" and that
was why I replied that you would be estimating too many variances and
covariances.

I can tell you why you are having problems fitting a mixed-effects
model.  Strangely it is because there is too little variability in the
patterns across the replicates, especially at the early times.  The
leaf number is discrete with a small range (all the leaffra
observations in this example are 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8) and non-decreasing
over time.  (I assume the nature of the experiment is such that the
leaf number is necessarily non-decreasing.)  That doesn't allow for
many patterns.  I'm sure some clever person reading this will be able
to tell us exactly how many different such patterns you could get but
I will simply say "not many".

Notice that the first 10 lines show that the leaffra is 4 at week 4 in
*every* replicate.  There isn't a whole lot of variation here for the
random effects to model.

The best place to start is with a plot of the data.  I changed the
levels of the rep factor to "f1"-"f5" and "s1"-"s5" to indicate that
each rep is at one level of the treat. (Those who are playing along at
home should be careful of the ordering of the original levels because
ID10, which I now call s5, occurs between ID1 and ID2.)

With this set of labels the cross-tabulation and treat should be

> xtabs(~ rep + treat, leaf)
    treat
rep  pHf pHs
  f1   4   0
  f2   4   0
  f3   4   0
  f4   4   0
  f5   4   0
  s1   0   4
  s2   0   4
  s3   0   4
  s4   0   4
  s5   0   4

Now look at lattice plots such as

library(lattice)
xyplot(heightfra ~ week | rep, leaf, type = c("g", "p", "r"), layout =
c(5,2), aspect = 'xy', groups = treat)

(I enclose PDF files of these plots for each of the three responses.)
First you can see that there is very little variation at the low end.
Strangely enough, this causes a problem in fitting mixed-effects
models because the mle's of the variances of  the random effects for
the intercept will be zero.  The lme function does not handle this
gracefully.  The lmer function from the lme4 package does a better job
on this type of model.

Also, note that the pattern of heightfra over time is not linear.  It
is consistently concave down.  Thuso a mixed-effects model that is
linear in week will miss much of the structure in the data.

The point of R is to encourage you to explore your data rather than
subjecting it to a "canned" analysis.  You could try fitting a
mixed-effects model to these data in SAS PROC MIXED or SPSS MIXED and
I have no doubt that those packages would give you estimates (not to
mention p-values, something that the author of lmer has been woefully
negligent in not providing :-) but you probably won't get much of a
hint that the model doesn't make sense.  I would prefer to start with
the plot and see what the data have to say.


The technical problem with convergence in lme is that the mle of the
variance of the intercept term is zero.  You can see that if you use
lmer from the lme4 package instead to fit the model.
the random effect for the intercept is estimate

Note that the lines after a<-xmlRoot(x) could be reduced to:

You could promote the options to errors (?warning) and use try()

Hi Jack,

Any intro stats book should have them.  See for example chapter 11 in

You can simplify the final 5 lines to

   absts = xmlApply(a, buildPubMedAbst)

which is shorter, fractionally faster and handles cases where there are
no abstracts.

I know it won't answer your question exactly, but using comGetObject  
instead of comCreateObject won't create new Excel instances, so at  
least you won't have more than one processes running, so this might  
solve some of your problems.

As for your second problem, I would venture to guess you need your  
paths with double backslashes instead of slashes. The following just  
worked over here:

  wb<-comInvoke(comGetProperty(obj,"Workbooks"),"Open", "C:\ 
\Documents and Settings\\Haris\\Desktop\\test1.xlsx")

Hi Ilona,

>> Is there a solution for this problem?

If there is, then Professor Bates (the gentleman who replied to your
question) will have tried to find it, and fix it, for you.

Professor Bates wrote/co-wrote the software package (nlme) you are using. 
And while I have nothing against Crawley's book, you are usually much better
off going to primary sources first, to solve this kind of problem (which, of
course you have done, though may not have been aware of it ;)

Hope this speeds you on your way...

Subject: [R] Simulating MATCHED Case Control Data
Message-ID: <152345.57819.qm@web45805.mail.sp1.yahoo.com>

Dear R-Help-List,

A few days ago I asked for help simulating
case-control data.  I got a great answer to help me
with my code, but I am having trouble modifying it for
1:M matched case-control data.  Does anyone have any
guidance/pointers for simulating 1:M matched data?.

Thank you,
-R




> Dear R-Help-List,

> case-control data in R?

I think the only simple method that allows you to
specify any arbitrary
 
population distribution of predictors and does not
rely on the logistic
 
regression model being true is to simulate cohorts and
then take a 
case-control sample from each one

Eg for a case-control sample of 500 cases and 1000
controls where there
 is 
about a 1% cumulative incidence
1. Generate all your predictor variables for a cohort
of 50,000 people,
 
from any distributions you want
2. Specify the disease model. This could be logistic
     logit(p(Y=1))=eta = b0+b1x1+b2x2+...
     p = exp(eta)/(1+exp(eta))
   or it could be anything else.
3. Now sum(p) gives the expected number of cases.
Adjust b0 so that
 this 
is a bit bigger than your desired number, eg 550.
4. Generate Y for the population by rbinom(50000,1,p)
5. Choose 500 cases and 1000 controls using sample().

It can be a bit dangerous to use quantile() to provide breaks for cut(),
because quantiles can be non-unique, which cut() doesn't like:
> x1 <- c(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2)
> cut(x1, breaks=quantile(x1, (0:2)/2))
Error in cut.default(x1, breaks = quantile(x1, (0:2)/2)) :
   'breaks' are not unique
>

However, cut2() in Hmisc handles this situation gracefully:
> library(Hmisc)
Attaching package: 'Hmisc'
        The following object(s) are masked from package:base :
          format.pval,
          round.POSIXt,
          trunc.POSIXt,
          units
> cut2(x1, g=2)
  [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2
Levels: 1 2
>

(Additionally, a potentially dangerous peculiarity of quantile() for 
this kind of purpose is that its return values can be out of order 
(i.e., diff(quantile(...))<0, at rounding error level), but this doesn't 
actually upset cut() in R because cut() sorts the breaks prior to using 
them.)

What about chron library:

dts <- dates(c("02/27/92", "02/27/92", "01/14/92",
               "02/28/92", "02/01/92"))
dts

tms <- times(c("23:03:20", "22:29:56", "01:03:30",
               "18:21:03", "16:56:26"))
tms
# [1] 23:03:20 22:29:56 01:03:30 18:21:03 16:56:26
x <- chron(dates = dts, times = tms)
x
# [1] (02/27/92 23:03:19) (02/27/92 22:29:56) (01/14/92 01:03:30)

I tried to install the package too, and I can confirm that there is the
same error.
the ...\library\mysql\libs is in the path
I copied an executable file into the directory named test123.exe
and used Start-> execute test123.exe
The program was executed

controll test:
I deleted the exeutable file
and used Start-> execute test123.exe  again
result
file not found.

so the path is ok but it isn't working

Did I miss something else?

Subject: [R] connecting RMySQL to and external server

It is trivial with RODBC (I know that is not what you asked, but it is the 
solution we found first).


For RMySQL, note first that the MySQL configuration file is consulted, so 
the default host is specified in the client section, which is like

[client]

port=3306

[mysql]

default-character-set=latin1

Add host=foo under [client] to change the default host.

And ?dbConnect mentions a 'host' argument under '...'.  That seems to work 
for me (provided of course the server allows connections from other 
machines): on my home network from Windows laptop to Linux server

> library(RMySQL)
Loading required package: DBI
> drv <- dbDriver("MySQL")
> con <- dbConnect(drv, user="ripley", host="auk", dbname="ripley")

This mixture of using the *local* configuration file overridden by 
arguments is a bit dangerous: RMySQL seems not really designed for 
client-server operation and there are some things that definitely do not 
work.  (As I recall, that included dbWrite as that imports a file which is 
on the local machine.)

Subject: [R]  Function built with segments
Message-ID: <14337780.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello,


I'm new to R. If I have a set of 10 points (X(i), Y(i)), is there an elegant
way to build a function y=f(x) that would be build out of the consecutive
segments of X(j),Y(j) points (with X(j) sorted)?


Thank you very much

TDB

First, you will likely have to use Ctrl-Alt-Delete - Task Manager - to
kill the Excel processes.

you could also try

 wb[["Saved"]]<-TRUE  # trick Excel to think that the workbook is
saved
 x$Quit() # close Excel
 rm(list=ls()) # remove all objects attached to environment

Yes.
approxfun() !

E.g.

 set.seed(1); x <- runif(10); y <- 3*x + rnorm(10)/10;  plot(x,y)
 myF <- approxfun(x,y)

 myF(0.1)
 ## [1] 0.3734227

and then

  plot(myF, add=TRUE, col=2) ## using plot() method for functions

or simpler to understand:

  xx <- seq(0,1, length=100)
  lines(xx, myF(xx), col=2)

There's the "Date" (S3) class, and even a "difftime" one

See

Hey Giovanni, 

thanks a lot for the help. I tried out combining the two functions
dlmModARMA and dlmMLE and it works. The only problem I have right now is
this. When I pass on the information about the starting parameters (param)
in the dlmMLE function I can only input one parameter vector. However, for a
VARMA I have a matrix of coefficients for both the AR part and MA part. How
can I signal to dlmModARMA which part of the passed on vector is supposed to
be the AR input, the MA input and so on? 

Thanks again! 

Benjamin

Subject: [R] truncated fields with RODBC
Message-ID: <300923.64529.qm@web60221.mail.yahoo.com>

For the record, the problem with truncated fields below was solved by increasing the Max LongVarChar variable in the data source settings page 1 from 8190 to 32760. So it was a psqlODBC problem not an RODBC problem. The command nchar(Grids$Grids) helped me see how large the fields actually were and what size of number I was looking for. 

cheers,
Mikkel

You need to study the RODBC documentation: you haven't set the type of
 the 
character fields in the database table correctly (in fact, you seem not
 
to have set them at all, hence will get the default of varchar(255)).

The 64k limit is for reading, not writing.

As ever, full details and a reproducible example are needed for people
 to 
help you fully.

This has been reported several times.  I posted a workaround earlier this 
week:

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2007-December/148290.html

so your searching of the archives was not very thorough!

Another workaround is to use rterm instead of Rgui.

You need to read about scope.

Try using return() from within your function to return the modified
data frame to the caller.

Best wishes,

Subject: [R] How to analyze observations list-wise deleted?
Message-ID: <4763EF6A.2090003@gmail.com>

I am using lrm in Design package for a project using logit analysis.
I think lrm is very useful for providing information about the number of
missing values due to the inclusion of each variable.

My first questions is: How to explore those observations that are
automatically deleted from the lrm?
For example, in a data I have more than 6,000 observations but after
list-wise deletion I have only 2,411 observations, where there are 583
observations for the dependent variable of value 1 and 1,828 for the
value 0.

One independent variable of the model "cDisagLW" accounts for the
deletion of 2,598 observations and I think this could cause problem in
regression result. So, could you show me a way to find out "who" are
those 2,598 observations?

A further question is, how to make a subset of the original data that
contains these 2,411 valid observations?
With this dataset, I like to explore the underlying distribution of the
regression data and contrast to the original data of 6,000 observations.

Thank you in advance.

Frank

The promised update, tseries_0.10-13.tar.gz, is on the CRAN master in 
source form.  Expect a binary Windows build to propagate through CRAN in 
the next few days (it seems to have missed today's updates).  AFAIK this 
fixes the problems under Rgui.

Indeed, I noticed the "host" argument but the server demands an username and a 
password for the machine first, and only after that for the MySQL server. 
Those were the arguments I was looking for.
I will study the RODBC package then, if it solves the problem.

Thank you very much,
Adrian

But you said 'connect to', not 'log in to', so how were we to know that?

I am afraid I don't understand your setup. MySQL works by listening on 
port 3306: user accounts don't come into that.  With our bastion servers 
all such ports are blocked and can only be accessed via tunnels 
(implemented by stunnel).  I think you need to discuss this with your 
sysadmins: if it works under mysql or for ODBC (isql) it will work with 
the corresponding R packages.

Use ssh forwarding to forward local port 3307 to remote port 3306
specifying the remote account and password.  Then if you use local port
3306 you can access your local version of MySQL and if you
use port 3307 you can access the remote version.   There is some
info on the MySQL site.  First test it out by running the mysql command
line program accessing the remote data base via port 3307 and once
that works you know its ok and you can try RMySQL or RODBC packages.

Of course, most definitely. I usually log in to the external machine using 
ssh, then access the MySQL server using the MySQL username and password.
I probably asked for too much from R, since logging to an external machine 
needs a secure connection.
I'll talk to our sysadmin for local advice, thanks again.

Adrian

Gabor's example already did that task.

I could not find it. The pubmed function appears to assume that you will 
already have a list of PMIDs. When I set up a function to take an 
arbitrary  PubMed search string (quoted by the user) and return the 
PMIDs, I had success by following Gabor's example:

> pm.srch<- function (){
   srch.stem <-"http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi?db=pubmed&term="
   query <-as.character(scan(file="",what="character"))
   doc <-xmlTreeParse(paste(srch.stem,query,sep=""),isURL = TRUE, 
         useInternalNodes = TRUE)
   sapply(c("//Id"), xpathApply, doc = doc, fun = xmlValue)
     }
> pm.srch()
1: "laryngeal neoplasms[mh]"
2: 
Read 1 item
      //Id      
 [1,] "18042931"
 [2,] "18038886"
 [3,] "17978930"
 [4,] "17974987"
 [5,] "17972507"
 [6,] "17970149"
 [7,] "17967299"
 [8,] "17962724"
 [9,] "17954109"
[10,] "17942038"
[11,] "17940076"

[15,] "17848278"
[16,] "17938330"
[17,] "17938329"
[18,] "17918311"
[19,] "17910347"
[20,] "17908862"

Emboldened by that minor success, I pushed on. Pubmed said your example 
was malformed and I took their suggested modification:
("Laryngeal Neoplasms"[MeSH] AND "Papilloma"[MeSH]) OR (("recurrence"[TIAB] NOT Medline[SB]) OR "recurrence"[MeSH Terms] OR recurrent[Text Word]) AND respiratory[All Fields] AND (("papilloma"[TIAB] NOT Medline[SB]) OR "papilloma"[MeSH Terms] OR papillomatosis[Text Word]) 

That returned 400+ citations, and I put it into a text file.

After quite a bit of hacking (in the sense of ineffective chopping with 
a dull ax), I finally came up with:

pm.srch<- function (){
  srch.stem<-"http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi?db=pubmed&term="
  query<-readLines(con=file.choose())
  query<-gsub("\\\"","",x=query)
  doc<-xmlTreeParse(paste(srch.stem,query,sep=""),isURL = TRUE, 
                     useInternalNodes = TRUE)
  return(sapply(c("//Id"), xpathApply, doc = doc, fun = xmlValue) )
     }

pm.srch()  #choosing the search-file
      //Id      
 [1,] "18046565"
 [2,] "17978930"
 [3,] "17975511"

Oh, I see.  The answer is just to do as usual, e.g. as follows, and R CMD
build simply takes care of it.

<code>
...
\usepackage{makeidx} 
\makeindex
...
\begin{document}
...
\index{something}

\printindex

Thanks Gabor, it is a little bit of a foreign language for me (at the moment) 
but I'm sure your hints will be relevant to our sysadmin.
I do want to understand this stuff myself, just need more digging in the 
manuals.

Cheers,
Adrian

Denoting with array3d the array and with matrix2d the data matrix:

colnames(array3d)=colnames(array3d)

Otherwise, using dimnames:
dimnames(array3d)=list(NULL,colnames(array3d),NULL)

You can operate using the "[" operator, that is:
array3d[,"region",] to extract the region columns from each dimension.

You obtain the same effect using the column number, i.e.
array3d[,2,]

It's only a warning!

It usually means that your system is set up with non-scalable versions 
of the adobe fonts, so that some fonts are substituted. This can be 
considered a good thing: The fixed-size bitmap fonts have been carefully 
designed for maximum legibility, whereas the scaled fonts look awful... 
However, the former are only available in pixel sizes 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 
17, 18, 20, 24, 25, 34, if you install both the 75 dpi and  100dpi font 
sets.

Subject: [R] R memory limits and good memory management
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.63.0712151342090.29270@lax.math.tulane.edu>

Hello,

I am not fluent in computer hardware or software development so I will try 
to be as precise as I can.  I am going to build some R routines to analyze 
large intraday financial data sets.  For this project I think that I 
need be concerned 
about R memory limits and good memory management/practices.  The following 
R help 
page states that the limit on individual objects (a vector) is around 200 
million elements.

http://sekhon.berkeley.edu/base/html/Memory-limits.html

What about data frames? And I suppose that I need to be aware of the 
objects in the working memory (overwrite as many objects as possible)?

Note, I am new to the issue of good memory management.  Any specific 
details on R memory and good practical advice are welcomed.

Thanks,

Chad R. Bhatti

 From your post it is not clear how the data are organized. Supposing 
they are in a data frame you could use the ~ sintax.

For example:
timeColumn=as.Date("01-01-1970") + 1:500
timeSeries=rnorm(500)
df=data.frame(time=timeColumn, index=timeSeries)
> > head(df)
>      time      index
> 1 1-01-20 -0.6382554
> 2 1-01-21 -2.0346649
> 3 1-01-22 -0.4900213
> 4 1-01-23  0.7311806
> 5 1-01-24  0.9386528
> 6 1-01-25  0.7868129
boxplot(index~months(time), data=df)

Perhaps you would order the 12 boxes according to the months:
monthColumn=ordered(months(df$time), levels= c("January", "February", 
"March",
            "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", 
"October", "November", "December"))
boxplot(df$index~monthColumn)

Sure,

there are several approaches to this, but in general thinking about your data 
in terms of 'grouping' factors can be helpful

example:

# 1 year's worth of dates:
d <- strptime(1:365, format="%j")

# some simulated data
x <- rlnorm(365)

# combine them into a DF 
dx <- data.frame(date=d, value=x)

# plot the data, note that x-axis is in dates:
plot(dx)

# now generate a grouping factor. how about months:
dx$month <- format(dx$date, format="%B")

# box and whisker plot for data *grouped* by month
boxplot(value ~ month, data=dx, las=3)


cheers,

Dylan

Dear Ilh

I was planning to dedicate a few hours this christmas to improve the AMORE
package. I would like to explore the possibilities of the openMP library
and to  programm a few more training algorithms. Right now the rbf
extension is ready but under testing.

I think that what you ask for would not need much time to get done. If you
provide me a detailed definition of your needs I can include them in my
to-do list. For that purpose it could be adequate to send me an email to
mcasl at unileon.es

Best wishes.

Manuel

Subject: [R] [HH] changing font size in interaction2wt
Message-ID: <87lk7vqzc4.fsf@pdrechsler.de>

Hi,

I would like to change font sizes (more generally the cex) in plots
produced by the function "interaction2wt" of the "HH" package.

Here is an example (from the interaction2wt example) of what I have
tried:

--8<---------------cut here---------------start------------->8---
rm(list = ls(all = TRUE))
rm(list = c(ls()))

library("HH")

## From the example:
vulcan <- read.table(hh("datasets/vulcan.dat"), header = TRUE)

## I would like to change the size (cex) of the axes description,
## labels and the overall line widths.
trellis.par.set(par.xlab.text = list(cex = 0.3),
                par.ylab.text = list(cex = 0.3),
                axis.text = list(cex = 0.3),
                par.main.text = list(cex = 0.3),
                par.sub.text = list(cex = 0.3),
                add.text = list(cex = 0.3))

foo <- interaction2wt(wear ~ filler + pretreat + raw, data = vulcan)
plot(foo)
--8<---------------cut here---------------end--------------->8---

Thankful for any pointers,

Patrick

Dear Prof. Ripley: 

      Thanks very much.  I did as you suggested, which I'll outline here 
to make it easier for anyone else who might have a similar problem: 

           * Read the offending *.Rd file in R using 'readLines' 

           * Applied 'iconv' to the character vector, following the last 
example in the help file.  This translated all offending characters into 
a multi-character sequence starting with '<'. 

           * Used 'regexpr' to find all occurrences of '<'. 

      The latter identified other uses of '<' but produced a 
sufficiently short list that I was able to find the problems fairly 
easily. 

      Thanks again.
      Spencer Graves   
p.s.  And in the future, I will refer 'Rd' questions to 'R-devel', per 
your suggestion.

Actually the object returned by Gabor's method was a list of lists. Here 
is one way (probably very inefficient) of getting "doc" into a 
data.frame:

colvals <-sapply(c("//title", "//author", "//category"), xpathApply, 
           doc = doc, fun = xmlValue)

titles=as.vector(unlist(colvals[1])[3:17])

# needed to drop extraneous titles for search name and an NCBI header
#>str(colvals)
#List of 3
# $ //title   :List of 17
#  ..$ : chr "PubMed: (\"Laryngeal Neoplasm..."
#  ..$ : chr "NCBI PubMed"

authors=colvals[[2]]
jrnls=colvals[[3]]

# not sure why, but trying to do it in one step failed:
#  cites<-data.frame(titles=as.vector(unlist(colvals[1])[3:17]),  
#                     authors=colvals[[2]],jnrls=colvals[[3]])
# Error in data.frame(titles = as.vector(unlist(colvals[1])[3:17]), 
# authors = colvals[[2]],  : 
#  arguments imply differing number of rows: 15, 1
# but the following worked

 cites<-data.frame(titles=as.vector(titles))
 cites$author<-authors
 cites$jrnls<-jrnls
 cites

        <p>Evidence of a relation between gastroesophaeal reflux and 
pediatric respiratory disorders increases every year. Many respiratory 
symptoms and clinical conditions such as stridor, chronic cough, and 
recurrent pneumonia and bronchitis appear to be related to 
gastroesophageal reflux. Some studies have also suggested that 
gastroesophageal reflux may be associated with recurrent laryngeal 
papillomatosis, contributing to its recurrence and severity. AIM: the aim 
of this study was to verify the frequency and intensity of 
gastroesophageal reflux in children with recurrent laryngeal 
papillomatosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: ten children of both genders, aged 
between 3 and 12 years, presenting laryngeal papillomatosis, were 
included in this study. The children underwent 24-hour double-probe pH-
metry. RESULTS: fifty percent of the patients had evidence of 
gastroesophageal reflux at the distal sphincter; 90% presented reflux at 
the proximal sphincter. CONCLUSION: the frequency of proximal 
gastroesophageal reflux is significantly increased in patients with 
recurrent laryngeal papillomatosis.</p>

I would like to access, for instance, the PMID or the abstract within the 
<description> element, but I do not think that they have names in the the 
same way that <author> or <category> have xml named nodes. I suspect that 
getting the output in a different format, say as MEDLINE, might produce 
output that was tagged more completely.

Message-ID: <4D95AB5D-7E49-4791-88BE-52F50B32D447@stat.ucla.edu>

http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/psychoR/derivatives

Computes generalized eigenvalue solutions Ax=\lambda Bx
and generalized singular value solutions Rz=\gamma Px
and R'x=\gamma Qy for matrices that are differentiable
functions of a vector of parameters. Along with the
decomposition the code returns arrays with all first-order
partial derivatives of the values/vector wrt the parameters.
This makes it easy to apply the delta method to CA, CCA, MCA,
PCA and friends. But on a really large example you may be
in for an unpleasant surprise.

There is also a paper with the formulas in the same directory.

Note that Patrick Mair and I are in the process of converting some of  
the

Message-ID: <506c08d50712152031s1b1dc911v57974528f8af6f87@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to draw a polar plot, which is easy enough to do in the
plotrix package through the polar.plot function.

However I would like to change the origin of the length vector. For
instance all my length values are between 75 and 85, so instead of
having the origin as 0 (the default) I'd like it to be, say, 50.

Is there any way do to this in the polar.plot function, or if not is
there an additional package that will accomplish this.

I am running R 2.5 and the latest version of plotrix.

Thanks for your help

Do you use a ~/.my.cnf file?

There are many settings that can be made there.  Talk to your sysadmin
about those.

If we can assume that the abstract is always the 4th paragraph then we
can try something like this:

library(XML)
doc <- xmlTreeParse("http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/erss.cgi?rss_guid=0_JYbpsax0ZAAPnOd7nFAX-29fXDpTk5t8M4hx9ytT-",
isURL = TRUE, useInternalNodes = TRUE, trim = TRUE)

out <- cbind(
	Author = unlist(xpathApply(doc, "//author", xmlValue)),
	PMID = gsub(".*:", "", unlist(xpathApply(doc, "//guid", xmlValue))),
	Abstract = unlist(xpathApply(doc, "//description",
		function(x) {
			on.exit(free(doc2))
			doc2 <- htmlTreeParse(xmlValue(x)[[1]], asText = TRUE,
				useInternalNodes = TRUE, trim = TRUE)
			xpathApply(doc2, "//p[4]", xmlValue)
		}
	)))
free(doc)
substring(out, 1, 25) # display first 25 chars of each field


The last line produces (it may look messed up in this email):

I am trying to draw a polar plot, which is easy enough to do in the
plotrix package through the polar.plot function.

However I would like to change the origin of the length vector. For
instance all my length values are between 75 and 85, so instead of
having the origin as 0 (the default) I'd like it to be, say, 50.

Is there any way do to this in the polar.plot function, or if not is
there an additional package that will accomplish this.

I am running R 2.5 and the latest version of plotrix.

Thanks for your help

Hi John,

One alternative would be to use ggplot2 with a polar coordinate system:

library(ggplot2)
qplot(mpg, wt, data=mtcars) + coord_polar()
qplot(mpg, wt, data=mtcars, ylim=c(3,4)) + coord_polar()

etc.  You can see more examples of polar coordinates at
http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/coord_polar.html

although I'm still working on good axes etc for plots in polar coordinates.

I don't recall that happening with TABs, but a problem can arise when
the last (rightmost) column has more than a few empty cells.
Occasionally, I've had to resort to adding a dummy column on the
right, but as Peter suggests, read.delim is usually less involved.

Hello,

Below is the code for a basic bar graph. I was seeking advice 
regarding the following:

(a)  For each time period there are values from 16 people. How I can 
change the colour value so that each person has a different colour, 
which recurs across each of the three graphs/tie epriods?

(b) I have seen much more sophisticated examples using lattice (e.g 
each person has a separate panel/plot). I am open to alternative code 
as to how I could present this data.

Time1 <- c(9.0,6.0,1.0,5.0,7.0,9.0,5.0,7.5,6.0,8.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,4.0,5.0,5.0)
Time2 <- c (10,5,3,3,3,6,7,8,5,8,7,7,9,8,5,3)
Time3 <- c (10,0,3,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)
df  <- rbind  (Time1, Time2, Time3)
dft <- (t(df))
dft
barplot(dft, beside = TRUE, main= "Risk score by assessment", xlab = 
" Score", ylab = "frequency", col="blue")


Any assistance is much appreciated,

regards

Bob Green

But you will have to test it, and I would appreciate knowing if anything 
breaks. Thanks.

Hi Bob,

library(plotrix)
barplot(dft, beside = TRUE, main= "Risk score by assessment", xlab =
  " Score", ylab = "frequency",
  col=color.scale(1:16,c(1,0.5,0),c(0,1,0),c(0,0.5,1)))

Thanks Jim.

That works well, thanks. Is there a way I can specify the range as it
seems to adjust automatically. Also I was hoping to plot multiple
datasets on the same chart but with different colours.

In the normal plot() I can do this with col =  .... I was hoping to do
the same with points.col but it doesn't seem to work.

Thanks a lot for your help

I have the following code, where we need to solve for mu and sigma, when we
have mut and sdt. Can you suggest how to use a solve function in R to do
that? I am new to R and am not sure how to go from defining the functions,
to solving for them. 

Thanks


truncated <- function(x)
{

mu=x[1];
sigma=x[2];


f <- function(x) (1/(sigma*sqrt(2*pi)))*exp(-(x-mu)^2/(2*sigma^2));

pdf.fun <- function(x) x*f(x);

sd.fun <- function(x) (x)^2*f(x);

st=integrate(sd.fun,lower=-Inf,upper=1)$value;

a=integrate(pdf.fun,lower=-Inf,upper=1)$value;

a1=integrate(f,lower=-Inf,upper=1)$value;

mut <- a/a1;
sdt <- sqrt((st/a1)-(a/a1)^2);

}

Hello the list,

I am trying to write a "cleanProgramming" function to test the 
procedure I use. For example, I want to be sure that I am not using 
globals variables. The function "findGlobals" detect that.

To list the globals used in function "fun", the syntax is : 
"findGlobals(fun,FALSE)$variable"

My problem is that I want to use it in a function, something like :

cleanProg <- function(name){
  if(length(findGlobals(name,FALSE)$variable>0){
    cat("Warnings: there is globals is function ",name,"\a\n")
  }
}

But findGlobals take a function as first argument, not a variable 
containing a function name.

Anyway to solve that?

Christophe

Use get() to find an object with a given name.  You need to be careful 
to specify where it should look (the envir argument); typically 
parent.frame() is appropriate, but your cleanProg function should allow 
the user to override this.

[3,] 53.87   NA
Thank you in advance.

Thank you for the attempt.
On your advice I am working with lists to avoid the numbers (which are
geographical coordinates) becoming strings. The call you suggest does
not take care of that. Now I am trying to extract the coordinates from
the list efficiently. Of course I could make a loop, e.g.

punkte[,1]<-orte[[1]][[2[1]]]

being replaced by

for(n in 1:lang){
punkte[n,1]<-orte[[n]][[2[1]]]
punkte[n,2]<-orte[[n]][[3[1]]]
}

but I wonder if there was no more efficient way.
Faithfully,
Mag. Ferri Leberl

You can use the following to get the data from that call:

> x <- do.call('rbind', kaste)
> as.matrix(x[,2:3])
     [,1]  [,2]
[1,] 53.55 8.58
[2,] 53.87 8.7
[3,] 53.87 10.69

Ugly brute-force approach:  col=1:16 .   Jim Lemon's
approach with Plotrix is much nicer.  You might also
want to have a look at RColorBrewer though I am not
sure how easily it can handle 16 different colours.


barplot(dft, beside = TRUE, main= "Risk score by
assessment", xlab = " Score", ylab = "frequency",
col=1:16)

Why not use a line plot?  It would be much easier to see how an
individual is changing over time.  Here's a simple way to do that
using ggplot2:

df  <- data.frame(Time1, Time2, Time3)
df$id <- 1:nrow(df)
dfm <- melt(df, id="id")

qplot(variable, value, data=dfm, group=id, geom="line")

Yes, for some ways of running a script (and you haven't told us how your 
intend to run this).  E.g.

% Rscript foo.R

works, where

% cat foo.R
mydata <- read.table(stdin(), header=TRUE, sep="\t", nrow=6)
freqesperado
117.5
147.5
47.5
17.5
27.7
16.3

mydata

But, e.g. you can't use source() (it parses the input before running it), 
amongst others.

What I was trying to indicate in my replies is that "this problem" is
the user attempting to fit a model that is not appropriate for the
data.

I feel, and I hope that Jos? Pinheiro and I conveyed in our book, that
analysis of longitudinal data should always begin with plots of the
response versus time by experimental unit.  Much of the wonderful work
that Deepayan Sarkar did in developing the lattice package was
motivated by the desire to produce exactly those plots.  Because the
purpose of the analysis is to look at the behavior within units over
time and see how these patterns differ between units, it is clear that
you should always begin with such a plot.

It is disappointing to have users feel that the software is somehow
inferior because it doesn't mindlessly produce estimates for
inappropriate models when it is so simple for the user to check the
patterns in the data and decide if the model is appropriate.

As I said, I think that SAS and SPSS are better tools for fitting
"the" repeated measures model or "the" longitudinal data model when
you don't want to be bothered with actually looking at your data and
thinking about the model.  (And yes, I am being a trifle sarcastic in
saying that.  Please don't quote me as having endorsed the SAS and
SPSS mixed model software.)

By the way, I received a personal reply from a friend who asked what I
meant when I said that the model fit by SAS PROC MIXED to these data
may not make sense.  I haven't used SAS PROC MIXED in a long time (I
can never get past the "CARDS;" statement and still take the software
seriously) but I strongly suspect that it would produce one of those
mixed models that occurs in SAS computation and nowhere else.  If you
allow correlated random effects for the intercept and slope on these
data you will probably get the ML or REML estimate of the variance of
the intercept random effects being driven to zero while the estimate
of the covariance of the intercept and slope random effects stays
decidedly nonzero.  Apparently mathematical impossibility is not an
impediment to parameter estimation in such cases.  In fact, Singer and
Willett claim on p. 154 of their 2003 book "Applied Longitudinal Data
Analysis" that one can go further and invoke an option to allow for
negative variance estimates.  The mind boggles.

Subject: [R] paste dependent variable in  formula (rpart)?
Message-ID: <476579AA.2020604@web.de>

Hello,

i'm trying to replace  different  target variables in rpart with a 
function. The data.frame getting always the target variable as last column.
Try below, i get the target variable in the explained variables, too!?  
Have anybody an advice to avoid this.

rp1 <- rpart(eval(parse(text=paste(names(train[length(train)])))) ~ . , 
data=train,cp=0.0001)

regards & many thanks

It looked beautifully regular in my newsreader. It is helpful to see an 
example showing the indexed access to nodes. It was also helpful to see the 
example of substring for column display. Thank you (for this and all of 
your other contributions.)

I find upon further browsing that the pmfetch access point is obsolete. 
Experimentation with the PubMed eFetch server access point results in fully 
xml-tagged results:

e.fetch.doc<- function (){
   fetch.stem <-
        "http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?"
   src.mode <- "db=pubmed&retmode=xml&"
   request <- "id=11045395"
   doc<-xmlTreeParse(paste(fetch.stem,src.mode,request,sep=""),
                          isURL = TRUE, useInternalNodes = TRUE)
     }
# in the debugging phase I needed to set useInternalNodes = TRUE to see the  
tags. Never did find a way to "print" them when internal.

doc<-e.fetch.doc()
get.info<- function(doc){
         df<-cbind(
 	Abstract = unlist(xpathApply(doc, "//AbstractText", xmlValue)),
 	Journal =  unlist(xpathApply(doc, "//Title", xmlValue)),
 	Pmid =  unlist(xpathApply(doc, "//PMID", xmlValue))
                   )
   return(df)
   }

Subject: [R] read.table and double quotes in strings
Message-ID: <200712162209.22705.dusa.adrian@gmail.com>


Dear all,

Some very wise data entry person gave me about an hour of a headache, trying 
to find out why a 2000x500 dataframe won't be read into R.
After much trial and error, I pinpointed the problem to an accidentally 
inserted double quote into a string variable (some comments from an open 
question). This can be replicated by:

aa <- data.frame(id=1:2, var1=c("some \" quote", "without quote"))
> aa
  id          var1
1  1  some " quote
2  2 without quote

Saving this with R:
write.table(aa, "aa.dat", sep="\t", row.names=F)

creates the following ASCII file (between #s)

### R export
"id"	"var1"
1	"some \" quote"
2	"without quote"
###

which throws an error when trying to load it back:

> bb <- read.table("aa.dat", sep="\t", header=T)
Warning message:
In read.table("aa.dat", sep = "\t", header = T) :
  incomplete final line found by readTableHeader on 'aa.dat'

The dataframe was initially an SPSS file, which saved it as tab delimited in 
this format:

### SPSS export
"id"	"var1"
1	"some " quote"
2	"without quote"
###

which of course thrown the same obvious error.

StatTransfer was the only software that solved the problem of exporting the 
SPSS file in a tab delimited file that could finally be imported in R, and 
the saved file looks like this:

### StatTransfer export
"id"	"var1"
1	"some "" quote"
2	"without quote"
###

Given these examples, I have two questions:
1. What is the correct syntax to import the R-exported file
2. What can I do to prevent these situations from happening?
(besides whipping the data entry person :), I am referring to R procedures to 
detect and correct such things)

Thank you,
Adrian

Trying to answer question number 2: would the usage of qmethod="double" 
argument in write.table solve the problem *in general*?

What are the situations that specifically need escaping the quote character?

Thank you,
Adrian

You can easily install ubuntu on it (although it might require
an external drive):
http://hup.hu/node/48116
So running R should not be problem.

You're correct, yet again; I did a copy/paste/forget-to-edit. And thanks 
for the further tip.

And now I understand where that odd "\n      <text>" originated before I 
changed the searched-for node name from \\Abstract to \\AbstractText. It's 
a remnant from the pretty-printing of the XML tree after excising the 
intervening node name.

Subject: [R] levelplot border and dendrogram width
Message-ID: <20071216171336.8ic5nl5og0soocgw@webmail.utoronto.ca>

Hello,

I'm trying to learn how to use lattice and levelplot in particular.   
There are three elements of customizing the plots I'm stuck with:

a) Is there a way to put borders around each "cell" within a  
level-plot.  I'm trying to do something like the  
colsep/rowsep/sepcolor/sepwidth parameters of heatmap.2 in gplots

b) Can I alter the line-width of dendrogram added to the levelplot  
using latticeExtra?

c) Can I alter the spacing between the dendrogram and a row of  
coloured rectanges added to a dendrogram using the add option?

The basic code-example that I've been trying to tweak is below, any  
suggestions and hints are very much welcome!!  In particular, I'm not  
sure where to find documentation on parameters for these, so hints on  
where to look would be great!

Paul



library(lattice);
library(latticeExtra);

tmp <- rnorm(100);
tmp <- matrix(data = tmp, nrow = 10, ncol = 10);

dd.row <- as.dendrogram( hclust( dist( tmp ) ) );

levelplot(
	tmp[order.dendrogram(dd.row), ],
	aspect = "fill",
	scales = list(

I guess you want something along the following example:

   train <- iris
   form <- as.formula(paste(names(train)[length(train)], "~ ."))
   rpart(form, data = iris)

or some data.frame method for rpart....

saveXML(node)

will return a string giving the XML content of that node as tree.

Subject: [R] more structure than 'str'?
Message-ID: <4765E2A5.4010809@pdf.com>

      How can I see more of the structure than displayed by 'str'?  
Consider the following: 


tstDF <- data.frame(a=1, row.names='b')
 > str(tstDF)
'data.frame':   1 obs. of  1 variable:
 $ a: num 1

     
      The object 'tstDF' has row.names, but I have to suspect they are 
there -- AND know a function like 'row.names' or 'dimnames' -- to see 
them. 

      I've found 'str' extremely valuable for understanding and 
explaining to others the internal structure of an R object.   In many 
cases, it has helped me find fairly simple ways to do things with R 
objects that might have been much more difficult and perhaps infeasible 
without 'str' -- and without access to the right expert, who may not be 
available in the time I have to solve a particular problem. 

      Thanks again to Martin Maechler, who wrote 'str', and to everyone 
else who has replied to questions from me over the years. 

      Best Wishes,
      Spencer Graves
p.s.  'methods(class="data.frame")' would help in this example.  
However, 'methods' won't always find all available and recommended 
extractor functions.  For example, 'methods(class="lm")' was not able to 
find 'AIC' for me just now.

str is generic.

[1] str.data.frame* str.default*    str.dendrogram* str.logLik*     str.POSIXt*

    Non-visible functions are asterisked

As you see there is a data.frame method that chooses not to report on the 
"row.names" attribute.

You can get the default behavior by removing the class attribute:

> str(unclass(tstDF))
List of 1
  $ a: num 1
  - attr(*, "row.names")= chr "b"

Turn your problem into an optimization one and use the various  
optimization abilities of R, for instance have a look at nlm:

?nlm

As an example to solve the rather simple:
x-y=0
x+y=2

We could do:

f <- function(vals) {
	x <- vals[1]
	y <- vals[2]
	sum(c(x-y,x+y-2)^2)
}
nlm(f, c(2,2))

PS: A google search for "rhelp solving nonlinear system of equations"  
would likely have given you some starting points.
PS2: Perhaps someone more expert could comment on the differences  
between optim, nlm and nlminb.

Sorry for using library instead package, but

library() is one command for using packages.

Therefore I (and it seems that i am not the only one) used library instead package.

Hello

[An answer was posted just now using numerical ideas;
here is an answer from a symbolic perspective]

These equations involve x^y in more than one unknown,
so inverse functions cannot be used.

I do not think you will be able to characterize even the number
of solutions, let alone their nature.

To see the difficulty, look at the Lambert W function.

My advice would be to simplify, simplify, simplify
your problem as far as possible; remove terms
successively until you are left with a trivial
system, then add *one* term and see if
this produces any insights.

Thank you for your helpful answer. The only thing
obout what I still wonder is that some of the analyses
work with R some time and some time not without any
changes in the data or commands.
Your text (from both emails) is cut at the end, so
that  your information about the convergence error
problem is  not complete. Would you send it again?
Than you for your help!

Subject: [R] re store pictures in an automatically named files using loops
Message-ID: <14370153.post@talk.nabble.com>


Dear all:
     I hope that the file in which the picture is stored has the same name
as the " main" title of the picture . But it turns out that , the name of
the file is :names(spl.sp)[i].bmp,while the main title of the picture is
names(spl.sp)[i+1]
 It seems that the problem is related to the "device". But I am finding it
very difficult to understand .
  Do you have any idea about that?

Here is my function:
 
sp.drawK<-function(spl.sp){
env<-list() 
for(i in 1:length(spl.sp)){
if(spl.sp[[i]]$n==1) next
else{
env[[i]]<-envelope(spl.sp[[i]],Kest)
  plot(env[[i]],main=names(spl.sp)[i])
  legend("topleft",lty=1:4,col=1:4,legend=c("obs","theo","hi","lo"))
  text(2,500,cex=0.8, paste("n=",spl.sp[[i]]$n,sep=""))
  bmp(paste(names(spl.sp)[i],".bmp",sep=""))

  }
}
}

   Best wishes,

Subject: [R] kernlab and gram matrix
Message-ID: <47663666.8000707@maunz.de>

Hi, this is a question about the R package kernlab.

I use kernlab as a library in a C++ program. The host application 
defines a graph kernel (defined by me), generates a gram matrix and 
trains kernlab directly on this gram matrix, like this:

regm<-ksvm(K,y,kernel="matrix"),

where K is the n x n gram kernelMatrix of my kernel, and y is the 
R-vector of quantitative target values.
So, to make sure you got it: I don't want kernlab to compute the kernel 
values by itself. Rather, this is a task for the host application.

Learning (see above) works well, but how do I predict a new instance? I 
couldn't find any information in this respect in the manual. The only 
examples for prediction were concerned with data from the input space, 
which i don't have, since my input space consists of graphs. I tried the 
following:

predict(regm,x,type="response")

where x is the 1xn R-matrix containing kernel values between the 
instance to be predicted and my training points. This won't work:

Error in as.matrix(Z) : object "Z" not found.

I'm using the current CRAN version of kernlab. Any help by kernlab users 
who had a similar task to do would be appreciated.

Best regards,
Andreas Maunz

I know ROCR although I am not familiar with ROC. I have seen the AUC
function of ROCR, but are you sure that this is applicable to the
stated problem, i.e. calculate AUC of serum levels of a drug over
time?! ROC seems to handle completely different problems.

I have been reading the following post (thanks for the hint Stephen):

I tried it:

> trap.rule <- function(x,y) sum(diff(x)*(y[-1]+y[-length(y)]))/2

[1] -45

It is not the correct value, but the formula seems applicable and I
changed it to

> auc <- function(x,y) sum((x[-length(x)] + x[-1]) * (y[-1]-y[-length(y)]))/2
> auc(x,y)
[1] 35

which seems to be correct. I hope everyone agees.
I didn't know it's that simple. I guess I don't need another function.
Thank's for all the help and all the suggestions.

Here's a slightly cleaner version:

showNonASCII <- function(x)
{
     ind <- is.na(iconv(x, "latin1", "ASCII"))
     xxx <- iconv(x[ind], "latin1", "ASCII", sub="byte")
     if(any(ind)) cat(which(ind), ": ", xxx, "\n", sep="")
}

used as

> showNonASCII(readLines("foo.Rd"))

Subject: [R]  Parse Expression
Message-ID: <14370218.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello everyone, I would like to construct a datafram with the following
command. 

eval(parse(text=paste("df=data.frame(", cmd, ")", sep="")))

But it comes out " Error in parse(file, n, text, prompt, srcfile, encoding)
: 
        syntax error, unexpected $undefined, expecting ',' in
"df=data.frame(cbcDummy10to12 = 1,cbcForeWrld_Ret = 1,cbcYC10-2_"


"cmd" is a character string I obtained before, it is like:
 
cmd
[1] "cbcDummy10to12 = 1,cbcForeWrld_Ret = 1,cbcYC10-2_wld = 1"

Could anyone give me some advice? Many thanks.

cbcYC10-2_wld is an invalid variable name, since it contains a minus sign.

.. but don;t forget to add checkBuilt=TRUE , otherwise you may find (as
I did) that you update packages for your current version, but not those
built for a previous version of R.

You can't have a hyphen "-" in a variable name, i.e. cbcYC10-2_wld is 
not legal.  It is treated as a subtraction.
I think the "$undefined" refers to 2_wld; the parser has no idea what 
that is supposed to be.

The  eee is getting good reviews but an in-depth review in

Message-ID: <fd3c7adf0712170608r444e009djc63c489eb2627e78@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a vector of names, say :

names <- c("Factor 1", "Factor 2", Factor 3")

I am creating a dataframe and I want the column names to be mixed like this:
"Factor 1" " Sign Factor 1" "Factor 2" "Sign Factor 2" "Factor 3"
"Sign Factor 3"
How can I automate the creation of such a mixed vector? I tried with
rep but did not succeed.

Could someone please suggest a solution to this problem?
Thanks in advance!

Regards,
JM

I tried the example above, but only the first 20 PMIDs will be

Subject: [R] Must be obvious but not to me : problem with regular expression
Message-ID: <14370723.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hi,

I have a vector called nfichiers of 138 names of file whose extension is .P0
or P1 ... to P8.
The script is not the same when the extension is P0 or P(1 to 8).

Examples of file names :
[128] "Output0.P0"       
[129] "Output0.P1"       
[130] "Output0.P2"       
[131] "Output01102007.P0"
[132] "Output01102007.P1"
[133] "Output01102007.P2"
[134] "Output01102007.P3"
[135] "Output01102007.P4"


To extract the names of file with .P0 extension I wrote :
nfichiers[grep(".P0", nfichiers)]
For the other extensions :
nfichiers[grep(".P[^0]", nfichiers)]

But for the last, I get a length of 138 that is the length of the initial
vector although I have 130 files with .P0 extension.

So I tried "manually" with a small vector :
> s
[1] "aa.P0" "bb.P0" "cc.P1" "dd.P2"
> s[grep(".P[^0]", s)]
[1] "cc.P1" "dd.P2"

It works !!!

Has someone an idea to solve this small problem ?
Thanks in advance,
Ptit Bleu.

Message-ID: <7998345.1197902150135.JavaMail.?@fh127.dia.he.tucows.com>

Thank you, getobject is a roundabout, but solves the issue. BTW I 
discovered that

 system("taskkill /f /im Excel.exe") # kills the process just fine.

The second problem is not due to the backslash vs slash, you can try 
and see that using the forward slash works fine from ESS. The q. is how 
to submit a second argument to "Close"?
Submitting a second argument to Open works fine as shown by the "0" 
below, but neither "1" nor "-1" worked for Close. Very strange.

I know it won't answer your question exactly, but using comGetObject  
instead of comCreateObject won't create new Excel instances, so at  
least you won't have more than one processes running, so this might  
solve some of your problems.

As for your second problem, I would venture to guess you need your  
paths with double backslashes instead of slashes. The following just  
worked over here:

  wb<-comInvoke(comGetProperty(obj,"Workbooks"),"Open", "C:\ 
\Documents and Settings\\Haris\\Desktop\\test1.xlsx")

One problem above is that "." is special in regular expressions.  I'd 
also suggest adding $ at the end, to force the match to the end of the 
string.  That is, code as

grep("\\.P0$", nfichiers)

and

grep("\\.P[^0]$", nfichiers)

I don't know what false matches you were seeing, but this should 
eliminate some.

I guess you want
     grep("\\.P0$", nfichiers)
Otherwise you get "XP0X" as a positive as well.

And for the others:
   grep("\\.P[^0]$", nfichiers)
with ".P[^0]", you'd get "XPXX" as positive, for example...
because you are looking for something that contains a P that is preceded 
by any character and followed by some non-zero character.

Message-ID: <b7e16700712170716x2c7a0580yfca8df05245efcd7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I want to fit multiple cox models using the coxph() function. To do
this, I use a for-loop and save the relevant results in a separate
matrix. In the example below, only two models are fitted (my actual
matrix has many more columns), one gives a warning message, while the
other does not. Right now, I see all the warning message(s) after the
for-loop is completed but have no idea which model gave the warning
message. Is there a way in which the warning message can be captured
and saved (i.e. as a binary variable, having value 1 if there was a
warning message and 0 otherwise)? I can't possibly fit the models one
by one (and see if they give a warning message) as I have many of them
to fit.

Subject: [R] Reproducibility of experiment
Message-ID: <9564983215darteta001@ikasle.ehu.es>

Dear Marc and R-list,

thanks for your help. I 
have checked Bland-Altman help 
page about repeatability, and I learnt that instead of 
reproducibility, 
I was talking about repeatability. Although I am not sure whether they 
only 
focuse on agreement of two different measurement methods, and not 
on 
repeatability of one single method. 

To explain further on my topic, I have repeated ten times an 
experiment involving protein quantification(i.e. how much protein I 
have), 
giving me ten continuous values. All experimental settings are similar 
so there should be no variability due to day of experiment, operator
or any batch effect. My aim is to know whether these ten observations 
are good enough so that I can conclude that the repeatability of my 
detection technique is good. But as I have learnt from Altman?s page, 
it is not possible to set a threshold to the repeatability score to 
say my experiment is "repeatable".  
I guess I can obtain a 95% confidence interval for the protein 
quantification values, 
but I am not sure this will show how well my experiment performs. 
Putting it differently, 
something I would like to know is whether I can estimate
beforehand how many times I need to run an experiment in order to be 
confident that it is "repeatable".


Thanks for your comments

David

  The following Google search finds coding for cor.test:

  From those 6 hits, it is a short trip to the following link:

Subject: [R] Extending data.frame
Message-ID: <C38BF858.15DCC%ken.williams@thomson.com>

Hi,

I've got a long-running project whose data fits nicely into data.frame
objects in R.  As I accumulate more and more functions, I decided to switch
to an OO approach so I can organize things better.

Looking around at the various approaches to OO R, I came across R.oo, which
seems nice.

Where I'm currently stuck is getting my objects to be mutable.  For example,
in the following toy code, the addStuff() method has no effect:

> library(R.oo)
R.oo v1.3.0 (2006-08-29) successfully loaded. See ?R.oo for help.
> setConstructorS3("Foo", function(...) {
+   frame <- data.frame(foo=4, bar=3:5)
+   extend(frame, "Foo")
+ })
> setMethodS3("addStuff", "Foo", function(this, ...) { this$field <- 5 })
> f <- Foo(); f
  foo bar
1   4   3
2   4   4
3   4   5
> addStuff(f); f
  foo bar
1   4   3
2   4   4
3   4   5


Can anyone offer any advice?  I'm open to using a different OO system if
that's deemed advisable, I'm not very familiar with any of them.

Note that in my real (non-toy) application, I'll need arbitrary methods to
be able to read & write data to the object, so simple getField() and
setField() accessors won't be sufficient.

Thanks.

This is a problem in a contributed package; I've cc'd the maintainer

Thanks for the pointer (which was already reported privately previously),
but I didn't get round to fix it, yet. I'll try to fix it asap.

Message-ID: <4766A3C3.5070900@eva.mpg.de>

Hi there,
I'm using the tweedie distribution package and I cant figure out how to 
run a model using an identity link. I know I can use a log link by 
having link.power=0 and I think identity would be link.power=1, but I'm 
not sure. Furthermore when I try running it with link.power=1 it 
requires starting values which I cant manage to give appropriately so 
I'm not sure if its actually an identity link its using. I can't find 
this info on the help page and I was wondering if somebody could give me 
a hand.
Thanks a lot.
Cheers,
Cristina.

David,

There is information on Prof. Bland's pages pertaining to the questions
you ask. If you have not reviewed his FAQ, please do so as it covers
issues such as sample size calculations, etc.

If the 10 measures are all of the same quantity, then a simple one
sample t-test is all you need to determine whether or not the measured
values are significantly different than a presumably known correct value
and to get confidence intervals for the mean measurement.

However, if all 10 values are of the same quantity, you will not answer
the questions as to whether or not any measurement error is
constant/linear over the range of possible values and whether that error
is within "acceptable limits". This is what the Bland-Altman methods
address.

My recommendation would be to solicit local expertise in the design of
such studies, as in reality, all of this should have been specified a
priori.

In addition, both Profs. Bland and Altman participate in the MedStats
group and that would be a better forum for your queries. More
information here:

HTH,

Marc Schwartz

Plain reshape() too:

> df = data.frame(coor = paste("x", 1:4, sep=""), v1=c(12,1,12,33),
+ v2=c(33,123,NA,1), v3=c(123,NA,NA,NA))

    v
coor 1 12 33 123
  x1 0  1  1   1
  x2 1  0  0   1
  x3 0  1  0   0
  x4 1  0  1   0

(actually, varying=-1 also works.)

Hi,

I'm currently working with data that has values as large as 99,000,000
but is accurate to 6 decimal places. Unfortunately, when I load the
data using read.table(), it rounds everything to the nearest integer.
Is there any way for me to preserve the information or work with
arbitrarily large floating point numbers?

Thank you,

Hi Armin -- 

See the help page for esearch

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/esearch_help.html

especially the 'retmax' key.

A couple of other thoughts on this thread...

1) using the full path, e.g.,

ids <- xpathApply(doc, "/eSearchResult/IdList/Id", xmlValue)

is likely to lead to less grief in the long run, as you'll only select
elements of the node you're interested in, rather than any element,
anywhere in the document, labeled 'Id'

2) From a different post in the thread, things like

will lead to more trouble, because they assume that AbstractText, etc
occur exactly once in each record. It would seem better to extract the
relevant node, and query that, probably defining appropriate
defaults. I started with

xpath_or_na <- function(doc, q) {
    res <- xpathApply(doc, q, xmlValue)
    if (length(res)==1) res[[1]]
    else NA_character_
}

citn <- function(citation){
 	Abstract <- xpath_or_na(citation,
                           "/MedlineCitation/Article/Abstract/AbstractText")
 	Journal <- xpath_or_na(citation,
                          "/MedlineCitation/Article/Journal/Title")
 	Pmid <- xpath_or_na(citation,
                       "/MedlineCitation/PMID")
    c(Abstract=Abstract, Journal=Journal, Pmid=Pmid)
}

medline_q <- "/PubmedArticleSet/PubmedArticle/MedlineCitation"
res <- xpathApply(doc, medline_q, citn)

One would still have to coerce res into a data.frame. Also worth
thinking about each of the lines in citn -- e.g., clearly only applies
to Journals.  Eventually one wants to consult the DTD (basically, the
contract spelling out the content) of the document, confirm that the
xpath queries will perform correctly, and verify that the document
actually conforms to its DTD.

Following my own advice, I quickly found that doing things 'more
right' becomes quite complicated, and suddenly became satisfied with
the information I can get out of the 'annotate' package.

Are you sure?

To my knowledge, read.table doesn't round anything, except when running
out of bits to store the values in, and 13 decimal places should fit in
ordinary double precision variables.

Printing the result is another matter. Try playing with the
print(mydata, digits=15) and the like.

Did you set the  the character used in the file for decimal points?

dec = "." or  dec = ","

Subject: [R] regression towards the mean, AS paper November 2007
Message-ID: <4766BE33.1030806@gvdnet.dk>

Dear friends, regression towards the mean is interesting in medical 
circles, and a very recent paper (The American Statistician November 
2007;61:302-307 by Krause and Pinheiro) treats it at length. An initial 
example specifies (p 303):
"Consider the following example: we draw 100 samples from a bivariate 
Normal distribution with X0~N(0,1), X1~N(0,1) and cov(X0,X1)=0.7, We 
then calculate the p value for the null hypothesis that the means of X0 
and X1 are equal, using a paired Student's t test. The procedure is 
repeated 1000 times, producing 1000 simulated p values. Because X0 and 
X1 have identical marginal distributions, the simulated p values behave 
like independent Uniform(0,1) random variables." This I did not 
understand, and simulating like shown below produced far from uniform 
(0,1) p values - but I fail to see how it is wrong. I contacted the 
authors of the paper but they did not answer. So, please, doesn?t the 
code below specify a bivariate N(0,1) with covariance 0.7? I get p 
values = 1 all over - not interesting, but how wrong?
Best wishes

I can't quite understand what you're having difficulty with (is it 
constructing the array, or coping with the different 'matrices' having 
different column names, or something else?)

However, your sample data looks like it has a mixture of factor (region) 
and numeric data (Qty), so you're probably storing it in a data frame. 
AFAIK, there is no 3d object in R that can store mixed-type data like a 
data frame can.  An array object in R has to have the same data type for 
every column etc.

You do not want empirical=TRUE in the mvrnorm call. This pegs the
empirical means to exactly (0,0) which are obviously never significantly
different.

BTW, there's a function called replicate()...

Specifying empirical=TRUE means that your sampled values are not 
independent, the means are guaranteed to match exactly, and the mean 
difference is exactly zero.  Thus all of the t statistics are exactly 
zero, and the p-values are exactly 1.

Set empirical=FALSE (the default), and you'll see more reasonable results.

Message-ID: <fd3c7adf0712171047v128897fek622ae9bbd9b9ed1c@mail.gmail.com>

I have a data frame named "database" with panel data, a little piece

0.32         0.39

What I want to do is to calculate correlation between each factor and
external for each Symbol, and record the corr. estimate, the p.value,
the name and number of observations in a vector named "vector", then
rbind these vectors together in "results". When there are fewer than 5
observations for a particular symbol I want to put NAs in each column
of "vector".

I tried with the following code, making assumption that by splits
database into sort of smaller dataframes for each Symbol (that's the
"x"):

factor.names <- c("Factor1", "Factor2")
factor.pvalue <- c("SigF1", "SigF2")
results <- numeric()
vector <- matrix(0, ncol=(length(factor.names)*2+2), nrow=1)
colnames(vector) <- c("No.obs", factor.names, factor.pvalue)

application <- function(x){

    rownames(vector) <- x$Name

    for(i in 1:length(factor.names)){

        if(dim(x)[1]>=5){
            vector[1] <- dim(x)[1]
            vector[i+1] <- cor.test(x$External, x[,factor.names[i]],
method="kendall")$estimate
            vector[i+3] <- cor.test(x$External, x[,factor.names[i]],
method="kendall")$p.value
        } else {
            vector <- rep(NA, length(vector))
        }
    }
    results <- rbind(results, vector)
}

by(database, database$Symbol, application)

This did not work. I get :
"Error in dimnames(x) <- dn :
  length of 'dimnames' [1] not equal to array extent"

I used browser() and I see that the Name is not assigned to the row
name of vector and then dim(x)[1] does not work.

What am I doing wrong? Do not understand. :-(

Thank you in advance for your help.

JM

Obviously, A cannot assign a row name because the dimensions do not
agree. I can use rownames(vector) <- x$Name[1] though.

then things get calculated (I saw it with browser()) but rbind does
not do what I want it to do, "results" remains numeric().

why?

If you look at "vector" you'll see it has column dimension 6. You are  
trying to assign to it 5 colnames, which is not going to work. That's  
exactly what the error tells you, and it happens on the line above,  
the rest of your code is irrelevant to it.

Dear Charilaos,
Thanks, I see what you mean, but I just simplified the real code here
and I made a mistake by putting +2, it is +1. :-)

	This has nothing to do really with the question that Troels asked,
	but the exposition quoted from the AA paper is unnecessarily confusing.
	The phrase ``Because X0 and X1 have identical marginal  
distributions ...''
	throws the reader off the track.  The identical marginal distributions
	are irrelevant.  All one needs is that the ***means*** of X0 and X1
	be the same, and then the null hypothesis tested by a paired t-test
	is true and so the p-values are (asymptotically) Uniform[0,1].  With
	a sample size of 100, the ``asymptotically'' bit can be safely ignored
	for any ``decent'' joint distribution of X0 and X1.  If one further
	assumes that X0 - X1 is Gaussian (which has nothing to do with X0 and
	X1 having identical marginal distributions) then ``asymptotically''
	turns into ``exactly''.

Are you sure you don't have x and y wrong? Normally the x values
should be monotonically increasing.

	Not absolutely sure, but I infer from experimentation that ``poly''  
should
	be a (2-column) matrix, not a list:

	plot(0:1,0:1,type="n",xlab="x",ylab="y")
	melvin <- getpoly() # Clickety-clickety-clickety.
	str(melvin)
	clyde <- csr(melvin,100)
	irving <- kernel2d(clyde,melvin,h0=2)
	image(irving)

	HTH.

I know that persp3d has the option, but seems to only be able to expand the axes not reduce them.  Is there anyone who has an idea of how to do this?  Thank you for your time.

You'll need to do the trimming yourself.  There isn't currently any 
support for user-controlled clipping regions in rgl.

That is:  for the usual case where x and y are vectors, to limit x or y 
to a certain range, just take a subset of those values, and a subset of 
the rows or columns of z.  To limit the range of z, set out of range 
entries to NA.  It will probably look ugly because it will get a very 
ragged edge.

It appears that the NA handling for the case where x or y is a matrix 
leaves something to be desired.

Subject: [R] margin between plot region and axes
Message-ID: <1197922208.6147.25.camel@localhost>

Hi useRs,

in the following graphic...
http://www.survey4all.org/tmp/with_margin.png
I drawed a function and added two axes afterwards with "axis". I could
not find a way to erase the margin between the axes and the plotting
region, so I solved the problem with "text" and "segments", which looks
like this: 
http://www.survey4all.org/tmp/no_margin.png

My question: is there a way to add axes the usual way (as tried for the
first graphic), but to erase the margin, so that the axes start at point
(0/0) in my case.

thanks in advance for any help,
Albert

Not really sure if this is what you ask, but maybe you should call
your first plot() with xaxs="i" and yaxs="i". It reduces the default
4% increase on data range on both axis.

Another related issue is that uniform distributions don't look very uniform:

hist(runif(100))
hist(runif(1000))
hist(runif(10000))

Be sure to calibrate your eyes (and your bin width) before rejecting
the hypothesis that the distribution is uniform.

What are you trying to achieve with such a plot?  A stacked bar chart
only allows easy comparisons of cumulative totals (eg. cost 1, or cost
1 + 2, or cost 1 + 2 + 3) and it will be very difficult to compare
individual cost types or components within a type.  You might want to
think about a series of line plots instead.

thanks for your answer and sorry for the weak explanation of the
problem.
To put it another way:
consider the following simple statement:
hist(rnorm(100))
how can I influence drawing of the axis so that they lie directly on the
edges of the bars? The solution on this I think could directly be
applied to my problem.

Yes, that is correct.

Without any code to see, I will guess at what is happening.  The 
trouble with using an identity link is that the predicted means, 
say mu, may be negative, where as the Tweedie distributions have mu 
greater than zero.  In using the identity link, you may be asking R 
to fit the impossible.

Perhaps the question you need to ask is this:  Why do you need an 
identity link?

I have a data frame, where two last columns - "month" and "year" - are
character vectors. The "year" vector is made of two numbers (i.e. "97"
for 1997, "07" for 2007, etc)
What I want to do is to create a variable "Year" that is mode numeric
and where each record is a four-figure number (1997, 2007,...)
I have about 40000 rows in the dataframe, the observations are for 10
years (so there are multiple rows for each year).
I tried the following, but the program runs and runs, and if I abort
it all the years in "Year" are 1997:

for(i in 1:dim(database)[1]){
    if(database$year[i]>90) {
           database$Year[i] <- as.numeric(database$year[i])+1900 } else {
           database$Year[i] <- as.numeric(database$year[i])+2000
    }
}

Thanks in advance for explanations.

I'm not sure. You included my simple example. rather than your search string 
that provoked an error. This is an example search that one can find on 
the how-to page for literature searches with /esearch:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi?db=pubmed&term=PNAS[ta]+AND+97[vi]&retstart=6&retmax=6&tool=biomed3

I am wondering if you used spaces, rather than "+"'s? If so then you may 
want your function to do more gsub-processing of the input string.

When I use the search terms in NCBI's example I get:

> pm.srch<- function (){

Without actually running the code, one problem seems to be that the line
if(database$year[i]>90)
is comparing a character vector to 90 and not the numbers that you are
expecting.

You could try this instead:
database$year <- as.numeric(database$year)
ifelse(database$year > 90, database$year + 1900, database$year + 2000)

If I have my information right, R will use dual- or quad-cores if it's 
doing two (or four) things at once. The second core will help a little bit 
insofar as whatever else your machine is doing won't interfere with the 
one core on which it's running, but generally things that take a single 
thread will remain on a single core.

As for RAM, if you're doing memory-bound work you should certainly be 
using a 64-bit machine and OS so you can utilize the larger memory space.

Subject: [R] Scatterplot Showing All Points
Message-ID: <1197940463.47671eef4045e@webmail.fas.harvard.edu>



Hello all,


I'm trying to graph a scatterplot of a large (5,000 x,y coordinates) of data
with the caveat that many of the data points overlap with each other (share the
same x AND y coordinates).  In using the usual "plot" command,


> plot(education, xlab="etc", ylab="etc")


it seems that the overlap of points is not shown in the graph.  Namely, there
are 5,000 points that should be plotted, as I mentioned above, but because so
many of the points overlap with each other exactly, only about 50-60 points are
actually plotted on the graph.  Thus, there's no indication that Point A shares
its coordinates with 200 other pieces of data and thus is very common while
Point B doesn't share its coordinates with any other pieces of data and thus
isn't common at all.  Is there anyway to indicate the frequency of such points
on such a graph?  Should I be using a different command than "plot"?


Thanks,


Wayne

Use 'hexbin' from bioconductor to show how many points are in a grid
on the graph.

Subject: [R]  creating a database
Message-ID: <14375875.post@talk.nabble.com>


useR's,

I am writing a program in which the input can be multidimensional.  As of
now, to hold the input, I have created an n by m matrix where n is the
number of observations and m is the number of variables.  The data that I
could potentially use can contain well over 20,000 observations.  

Can a simple matrix be used for this or would it be better and more
efficient to create an external database to hold the data.  If so, should
the database be created using C and how would I do this (seeing as that I
have never programmed in C)?  

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you

Derek

The jitter() function can add a bit of noise to your data, so that 
repeated points show up as groupings instead of isolated points.

I've been running R on a quad-core using Debian Gnu/Linux since March
this year, and I am very pleased with the performance.

What are you intending to do with the data?  How big is 'm'?  How do
you want to access the data?  You can always put it in a SQL database
that R can access and then pull out the rows that you are interested
in.  If 'm' is 100, then if you are just keeping numeric data, this
will only require 16MB of memory, so you can just keep it in memory.

Some more information about the characteristics of the data and what
you want to do with it are required to determine what might be the
appropriate method for storing/accessing it.

If x is the result of your read.table, it is a double
precision number (matrix, data.frame, etc.), but by
default only up to 7 decimal digits of x are printed,
so you do not see the rest of x. 
Try for example
options(digits=15) 
and see how your x look then.

Wayne,

I am fond of the bagplot (think 2D box plot) to replace scatter plots
for large N. See
http://www.wiwi.uni-bielefeld.de/~wolf/software/aplpack/ and aplpack
in CRAN.

I tried my theory that one would need "+"'s instead of spaces, but 
disproved it. Spaces in the input string seems to produce acceptable 
results on my WinXP/R.2.6.1/RGui system even with more complex search 
strings.

Dear List,

Following the below question I have a question of my
own:
Suppose that I have large matrices which are produced
sequentially and must be used sequentially in the
reverse order. I do not have enough memory to store
them and so I would like to write them to disk and
then read them. This raises two questions:
1) what is the fastest (and the most economic
space-wise) way to do this?
2) functions like write, write.table, etc. write the
data the way it is printed and this may result in a
loss of accuracy. Is there any way to prevent this,
except for setting the "digits" option to a higher
value or using format prior to writing the data? Is it
possible to write binary files (similar to Fortran)?

Any suggestion will be greatly appreciated.

I ran a bayesian simulation sometime ago and it took me 1 week to finish
on a debian box (Dell PE 2850  Dual Intel Xeon at 3.6GHz  6GB). I think it
depends on the setting of the experiment and whether the code can be
parallelized.

Hi Wayne,
While this is not a really pretty picture, you can get a viewable plot 
with count.overplot if the first two elements of "education" are named 
"x" and "y" and they are the coordinates you want to plot. Otherwise, 
pass the x and y coordinates separately.

library(plotrix)
count.overplot(education,
  tol=c(diff(range(education$x))/10,
  diff(range(education$y))/10))

One suggestion seems to be still missing: 'sunflowerplot' of base R. May look
taggy, though, if you have 200 "petals". 

Actually the documentation of sunflowerplot is wrong in botanical sense.
Sunflowers have composite flowers in capitula, and the things called 'petals' in
documentation are ligulate, sterile ray-florets (each with vestigial petals
which are not easily visible in sunflower, but in some other species you may see
three (occasionally two) teeth).

Hi David,
This is a real challenge:

heights<-matrix(sample(10:70,54),ncol=3)
bar.colors<-rep(rep(2:7,each=3),3)
bar.densities<-rep(10,54)
bar.angles<-matrix(rep(rep(c(45,90,135),6),3),ncol=3)
barplot(heights,col=bar.colors)
barplot(heights,angle=bar.angles,add=TRUE,density=bar.densities)

Dear R's (most likely Hadley),

I want to build a stacked bar plot where I would like to define which 
colours will be used for each of the groups. However, I do not seem 
to find a way to do this, even if I've been looking over many places.

I have tried several variations, and my final try was this code, but 
I still do not manage to get the colours as I pre-define. Any hints 
about how to get this?

Thanks in advance,

Please don't ask the same question multiple times!

And no, backfitting and QR are unrelated concepts. You need to read up
on the theory, there are two fundamental books: Hastie & Tibshirani (gam
package) and Simon Wood (mgcv package). Both are a bit much to ask to
have summarized in email.

Using save/load is the simplest.  Don't worry about finding better 
solutions until you know those are not good enough.  (serialize / 
unserialize is another interface to the same underlying idea.)

Do please read the help before making false claims. ?write.table says

      Real and complex numbers are written to the maximal possible
      precision.

OTOH, ?write says it is a wrapper for cat, whose help says

      'cat' converts numeric/complex elements in the same way as 'print'
      (and not in the same way as 'as.character' which is used by the S
      equivalent), so 'options' '"digits"' and '"scipen"' are relevant.
      However, it uses the minimum field width necessary for each
      element, rather than the same field width for all elements.

so this hints as.character() might be a useful preprocessor.

> Is it possible to write binary files (similar to Fortran)?

See ?writeBin.  save/load by default write binary files, but use of 
writeBin can be faster (and less flexible).

> Any suggestion will be greatly appreciated.

Somehow you have missed a great deal of information about R I/O.
Try help.start() and reading the sections the search engine shows you 
that look relevant.

Hi Wayne,

I have two suggestion to you.
1. You add some random noise on both x and y data or
2. You graph bubble points, where the size is proportional to the
frequence of the xy combination.

x<-sample(1:10,10000,replace=T)
y<-sample(1:10,10000,replace=T)
xy<-cbind(x,y)
x11(1400,800)
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
plot(xy)
xy.random<-xy+rnorm(20000,0.1,0.1) 
plot(xy.random,cex=0.1)
xy.tab<-data.frame(table(x,y))
xy.tab$x<-as.numeric(as.character(xy.tab$x))
xy.tab$y<-as.numeric(as.character(xy.tab$y))
min.freq<-min(xy.tab$Freq)
max.freq<-max(xy.tab$Freq)
plot(xy.tab$x,xy.tab$y,cex=(xy.tab$Freq-min.freq)/(max.freq-min.freq)*5)

Assunto: [R] Scatterplot Showing All Points



Hello all,


I'm trying to graph a scatterplot of a large (5,000 x,y coordinates) of
data
with the caveat that many of the data points overlap with each other
(share the
same x AND y coordinates).  In using the usual "plot" command,


> plot(education, xlab="etc", ylab="etc")


it seems that the overlap of points is not shown in the graph.  Namely,
there
are 5,000 points that should be plotted, as I mentioned above, but
because so
many of the points overlap with each other exactly, only about 50-60
points are
actually plotted on the graph.  Thus, there's no indication that Point
A shares
its coordinates with 200 other pieces of data and thus is very common
while
Point B doesn't share its coordinates with any other pieces of data and
thus
isn't common at all.  Is there anyway to indicate the frequency of such
points
on such a graph?  Should I be using a different command than "plot"?


Thanks,

Hi Thomas,
This looks quite strange. By default, the function use the column names 
as labels.
What is grain ? A data.frame ? Why have you duplicated row.names? Please 
return the results of class(grain) and names(grain)

Cheers,

Onderwerp: [R] ggplot-How to define fill colours?
Urgentie: Hoog

Dear R's (most likely Hadley),

I want to build a stacked bar plot where I would like to define which 
colours will be used for each of the groups. However, I do not seem 
to find a way to do this, even if I've been looking over many places.

I have tried several variations, and my final try was this code, but 
I still do not manage to get the colours as I pre-define. Any hints 
about how to get this?

Thanks in advance,
Pedro
============================================
my code:
 >plotdata1<-data.frame(x=rep(factor(1:4),4), y=rep(0.1*(1:4),4), 
+group=as.character(rep(c('white', 'red', 'blue', 'green'),rep(4,4))))
 >plot0<-ggplot()
 >plot3<-plot0+layer(data=plotdata1, mapping=aes_string(x='x',y='y', 
+fill='group'),geom='bar', stat='identity', position='stack')
 >print(plot3)

Message-ID: <s767a34e.042@tedmail.lgc.co.uk>

Hiding in the windows faq is the observation that "R's computation is
single-threaded, and so it cannot use more than one CPU". So multi-core
should make no difference other than allowing R to run with less
interruption from other tasks. That is often a significant advantage,
though.

If I have my information right, R will use dual- or quad-cores if it's

doing two (or four) things at once. The second core will help a little
bit 
insofar as whatever else your machine is doing won't interfere with the

one core on which it's running, but generally things that take a single

thread will remain on a single core.

As for RAM, if you're doing memory-bound work you should certainly be 
using a 64-bit machine and OS so you can utilize the larger memory
space.

Message-ID: <200712181054.50986.s.wood@bath.ac.uk>

The model here is just a penalised GLM, and the warnings relate to the GLM 
fitting process. Fitted probabilities of 0 or 1 can be perfectly appropriate, 
but do indicate that the linear predictor is not really uniquely defined, and 
that some care may be needed in interpreting results (for example, if the 
fitted probabilities are zero or one, then a CI for the corresponding linear 
predictor will depend more on the prior assumptions about smoothness than 
anything else). This problem is not really GAM specific, it relates to any 
`logistic regression' model. 

Similarly, the GLM fitting IRLS iterations are not guaranteed to converge, and 
can fail, especially for overly flexible logistic regression models. Try 
this, for example....

x <- 1:10
y <- c(0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1)
glm(y~x,family=binomial)

I get...
...
Warning messages:
1: In glm.fit(x = X, y = Y, weights = weights, start = start, etastart = 
etastart,  :
  algorithm did not converge
2: In glm.fit(x = X, y = Y, weights = weights, start = start, etastart = 
etastart,  :
  fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred

...as models become more complex the scope for this sort of thing to happen 
increases, and some simplification may be appropriate. 

That said, mgcv::gam fitting with all smoothing parameters fixed, is slightly 
more likely to fail in this way than `glm' or `mgcv::gam' with some smoothing 
parameters  estimated, because of the steps taken to stabilise divergent fit 
iterations. When all smoothing parameters are fixed, mgcv uses older fitting 
routines that don't try as hard to stabilise a divergent fit as the newer 
fitting routines. This is a bit of an anomaly and I'll try and fix it for a 
future release. 

best,
Simon

Yes, but that is Windows-specific.

On most other platforms you can benefit from using a multi-threaded BLAS, 
such as ATLAS, ACML or Dr Goto's.  The speedup for linear algebra can be 
substantial (although sometimes it will slow things down).  Luke Tierney 
has an experimental package to make use of parallel threads for some basic 
R computations which may appear in R 2.7.0.

It should be possible to use a multi-threaded BLAS under Windows, but I 
know no one who has done it.  There is a viable pthreads implementation 
for Windows, and I've tested Luke's experimental package using it.

Some compilers' runtimes will be able to use parallel threads for other 
tasks.  Since all the examples I am aware of are expensive commercial 
compilers, I suspect R will make limited use of them.  (In particular, 
base R does not use the Fortran 9x vector operations at which many of 
these features are targeted: we probably would if we routinely used such 
compilers.)

I've had dual-CPU desktops for more than ten years.  Given how little 
speedup you are likely to get via parallel processing (only under ideal 
conditions do the optimized BLASes run >1.5x faster using two CPUs), the 
most effective way to make use of multiple CPUs has been to run multiple 
jobs: I typically run 3-4 at once to keep the CPUs fully used.

One way to run multiple R processes to cooperate on a single task is to 
use a package such as snow to distribute the load.

They only have 3GB of RAM, which 32-bit OSes can address.  The benefits 
really come with more than that.

The 'hazard ratio of the interaction' is not well defined.  Decide what 
hazard ratio you want to estimate, then ask summary to compute that, e.g.

summary(modINT, XX_PR=c(1,3), XX_DISF=2)

will estimate the 3:1 XX_PR hazard ratio at XX_DISF=2

You have a point. haha. 
But check the microarray literature; scatterplots have been used -
often - to display microarray data with 10000 observations at a time.
And in their defence, even on screen, a 600x600 pixel plot window holds
360000 pixels - 5000 is not a large fraction of that. Jittering has
visible effects on data at that resolution. Compare the two plots in 

library(MASS)
Sigma <- matrix(c(10,4,4,2),2,2)
xy<- round(mvrnorm(n=5000, rep(0, 2), Sigma), 1)
plot(xy,pch=".")
plot(jitter(xy, factor=2),pch=".")

But you're of course right to question how sensible this is. The best
you can get is a visual impression of the 'shape' of the data with a
greater perceived density at multiple observations which otherwise
overlapped.

Subject: [R] Capture warning messages from coxph()
Message-ID: <200712181337.lBIDb4F05711@hsrnfs-101.mayo.edu>


Xinyi Li asked how to keep track of which coxph models, called from within a
loop, were responsible for warning messges.  One solution is to modify the
coxph code so that those models are marked in the return coxph object.  Below
is a set of changes to the final 40 lines of coxph.fit, that will cause the
component "infinite.warn" to be added to the result whenever a warning was
generated; it will be a vector of T/F showing which component(s) of the
coefficient vector generated the warning.
  Change the code for coxph.fit.s, then do
	> source('coxph.fit.revised.s')    #or whatever you called it
	> coxph <- source('coxph.s')
	> coxph.wtest <- survival:::coxph.wtest

Line 2 causes you to have a local version of coxph, otherwise, due
to name spaces, the original version of coxph.fit will still be used.  Line 3
is another consequence of name spaces.  Then code such as

	for(i in 1:ncol(x)){
	    fit=coxph(TIME~x[,i])
 	    if (!is.null(fit$infinite.warn)) cat("Waring in fit", i, "\n")
	    sfit <- summary(fit)
	    results[i,1]=sfit$coef[1]
	    results[i,2]=sfit$coef[3]
	    results[i,3]=sfit$coef[5]
 	 }
Will report out the models with a warning.  

Notes
  1. The warning message is not completely reliable

  2. Name spaces protect a package from accidental overrides, when a user or 
some other package reuses a function name.  With its hundreds of packages, they
are a necessity for R.  But sometimes you really do want to override a
function; then they are a bit of a pain.  Others with a better grasp of R
internals may be able to suggest a better override than I have done here.

Sure.  The original post said there were about 50-60 unique locations. 
This plot:

x <- rbinom(5000, 20, 0.15)
y <- rbinom(5000, 20, 0.15)
plot(x,y)

has a few more unique locations; tune those probabilities if you want it 
closer.  Due to the overlap, the distribution is very unclear.  But this 
plot

plot(jitter(x), jitter(y))

makes the distribution quite clear.

I wouldn't use the default pch if I had 50000 points, but with pch=".", 
it's not so bad even in that case.

I used a GLM with a factor variable and wondered about that the first

means there is no result for Y1
Is it wrong to use factors in GLM or is there a statistical reason that 
there is no Y1 result ?

Hard to help as i do not have "y" and it definitelly is not a matrix as 
you tried to pretend. 

1.      Try to look at structure of your y object by str(y)
2.      Try to learn about how to extract parts of objects e.g. by reading

The big drawback of the bagplot, like the boxplot, is that it's
difficult to see multimodality.

library(reshape)
dfm <- melt(df, id = 1:3)
cast(dfm, ... ~ Var3)

You can find out more about the reshape package at http://had.co.nz/reshape

Subject: [R] ggplot2 - getting at the grobs
Message-ID: <20071218144135.4364EF800B@smtp3.ualg.pt>

Dear All,

I continue trying to get several of my plotting functions to use 
ggplot, because I really do like the concept of the graphical 
objects, and working with them in the abstract.
I am now trying to access the grobs to manipulate using grid. 
However, until now all I managed was to get the plot as a gTree 
object, and manipulate it as a gTree from there. The problem is that 
then it is no longer a ggplot, and thus I can no longer use the 
ggplot functions.
How to get at the grobs, without converting the ggplot into a gTree?

Thanks,
Pedro

Hi Davide,

It is difficult to say what the problem is without knowing more about the nature of the integrand.  So, you should do a couple of preliminary things before attempting compute the integral.

First, is the integral is finite? You should establish this.  Second, plot the integrand over the entire interval.  Then you need to think about the following: Is the integrand unimodal, with the mass concentrated over a small region? Or is it multimodal? Does it have thick tail?

Assuming that the integral is finite, you could try a few things:
1.  Divide the interval of integration into several small intervals (say, 10 or 100), and then use integrate() on each and then add up the results.  You can make this process more efficient if you know where the mass is concentrated.
2.  Transform the integrand.
3.  Try a simple trapezoidal rule quadrature.

Ravi.

Dear All,
I need to perform a numerical integration of one dimensional 
fucntions. The extrems of integration are both finite and the functions 
I'm working on are quite complicated. I have already tried both area() 
and integrate(), but they do not perform well: area() is very slow and 
integrate() does not converge. Are in R other functions for numerical 
integration of one dimentional functions?

Thanks in advance 

Davide

Try this:

out <- ftable(xtabs(Var4 ~ Var1 + Var2 + Var3, DF))
out[out == 0] <- NA

Omit the last line is 0 fill is what you had wanted.

This will do it except that it will eliminate all rows
without data:

out2 <- reshape(DF, dir = "wide", timevar = "Var3", idvar = c("Var1", "Var2"))
out2[is.na(out2)] <- 0

Omit the last line if NA fill is what you wanted.

The reshape package melt/cast routines (see Hadley's solution in this
thread) can be used
to give a similar result to the reshape command above (i.e. all
missing rows are not
included) except that cast is a bit more flexible since it has a fill= argument.

Another alternative is smoothscatter() in the geneplotter package from 
Bioconductor, which does a pretty reasonable job with these example data.

It's not the spaces, the problem is the tag (sorry that I didn't
specify this), or maybe the string []. I am working on a Mac OS X 10.4
with R version 2.6. Is it maybe a string conversion problem? In the
following warning strings in the html adress seem to be different:

Just one correction.  The cast function in reshape has an add.missing= argument
that can control this so actually any of the solutions could be
obtained with cast
using the fill= and add.missing= arguments to control which one you want.

Thx Hadley,
It works, but I need some finetuning.

If I use the following expression:
Newdf <-reshape(df, timevar="Var3", idvar=c("Var1","Var2"),direction="wide")

Newdf
Var1	Var2	Var3.W1	Var3.W2	Var3.W3	var3.W4
A	Fa	1	  	3		
A	Si	2				4
B	Si	5		
C	La			6
C	Do							7

Is there an option so that for each Var1 all possible combinations of Var2
are listed (i.e. creation of blanco lines).
Is it possible to name the columns with the values of the original Var3
variable, so that the name Var3.W1 changes to W1? 

Var1	Var2	W1	W2	W3	W4
A	Fa	1	3		
A	Si	2		4
A	La
A	Do			
B	Fa				
B	Si	5		
B	La
B	Do
C	Fa				
C	Si			
C	La		6
C	Do				7


Thx,
Bert

That plot is better than jittering, but there's the problem in the 
mosaic plot of understanding the scale of the rectangles:  is it area or 
diameter that encodes the count?  With a jittered plot, you lose 
resolution when the number of points gets too high because you just see 
a mess of ink, but at least you only require the viewer to count in 
order to get a close numerical reading from the plot.

I could also claim that while imperfect, at least jittering is widely 
applicable.  For example, if the data were not on a regular grid, 
perhaps because they had been generated like this:

xloc <- rnorm(50)
yloc <- rnorm(50)
index <- sample(1:50, 5000, rep=TRUE, prob = abs(xloc))
x <- xloc[index]
y <- yloc[index]

then jittering still works as well (or as poorly), but the imosaic would 
not work at all.  There are better plots than jittering available, but 
jittering is easy.

(Actually, with this dataset, plot(jitter(x), jitter(y)) is really poor, 
because jitter() chooses a bad amount of jittering.  But with manual 
tuning (e.g.  plot(jitter(x, a=0.1), jitter(y, a=0.1), pch=".")) it's 
not too bad.  So I'd say jittering worked, but the R implementation of 
it may need improvement).

Yes, I probably wouldn't recommend jittering if there were more than a 
few hundred replications at any point, or more than a few hundred unique 
points.

P.S. iplots 1.1-1 may have an init problem in Windows: in my first 
attempt, the plot made the boxes too large to fit in their cells, but it 
fixed itself when I resized the window, and the bug doesn't seem to be 
repeatable.

Yes, I agree.  (As an aside, there's actually a capital S in 
smoothScatter(), and it's a bit of a pain to install, because 
geneplotter depends on something that depends on DBI, which is not so 
easily available these days.)

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] New version of systemfit (not backward compatible)
Message-ID: <200712181715.57597.ahenningsen@email.uni-kiel.de>

Dear R users,

the systemfit package contains functions for fitting systems of simultaneous 
equations by various estimation methods (e.g. OLS, SUR, 2SLS, 3SLS). 
Currently version 0.8 of systemfit is available on CRAN. However, shortly we 
will upload version 1.0, which is NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE. The changes that 
broke backward compatibility were necessary to make systemfit() more similar 
to standard regression tools in R such as lm(). We hope that the usage of 
systemfit() is more intuitive for R users now. We will continue to maintain 
the 0.8 branch so that users can still use the old version if they do not 
want to update their R scripts. Both versions are and will be available for 
download from systemfit's website:
   http://www.systemfit.org/
which is a shortcut to 
   http://www.uni-kiel.de/agrarpol/ahenningsen/systemfit/

A paper that describes the (new version of the) systemfit package is 
forthcoming in the Journal of Statistical Software (JSS). A preprint of this 
paper is available on systemfit's website:
   http://www.systemfit.org/systemfit_paper_1.0.pdf

The following list summarizes the most important changes 
from version 0.8 to 1.0:
- some names of systemfit()'s arguments have changed to make it more 
  similar to standard regression tools in R
- the order of systemfit()'s arguments has changed to make it more 
  similar to standard regression tools in R
- the names of the elements in the object returned by systemfit() have 
  changed to make it more similar to lm()
- added several methods for systemfit objects that are generally 
  available for standard regression tools in R
- restrictions on the coefficients can be specified symbolically now
- the functionality of systemfitClassic() has been integrated into systemfit()
- replaced ftest.systemfit() and waldtest.systemfit() by the method
  linear.hypothesis()
- systemfit now uses the "Matrix" package for matrix calculations (this 
  makes the estimation of large models and large data sets much faster)
- improved checking of the arguments so that error messages are more 
  helpful now

We thank two anonymous referees of the JSS, Achim Zeileis, John Fox, William 
H. Greene, Ott Toomet, Duncan Murdoch, Martin Maechler, Duglas Bates and 
several (other) systemfit users for their answers, comments, and/or 
suggestions that helped us to improve the systemfit package.

Feedback is always welcome!

Somehow I always forget the capital S and wonder if I have loaded the 
correct package ;-D

As for installing the required dependencies, I believe this is actually 
quite straightforward:

source("http://www.bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("geneplotter")

Should install geneplotter and all required dependencies.

Best,

Jim

I think you're going to find that barchart with that
many values in a bar is going to be pretty well
uninterpretable.  

Jim Lemon gives the desired barchart but it is very
difficult to read.  

Stealing his code to create the same matrix I'd
suggest may be looking at a dotchart.  I'm not sure if
this is even close to an optimal solution but I do
think it's a bit better than a barchart approach
======================================================
heights<-matrix(sample(10:70,54),ncol=3)
bar.colors<-rep(rep(2:7,each=3),3)
cost.types <- c("Direct", "Indirec", "Induced")
colnames(heights) <-  c("A", "B", "C")
rownames(heights) <- c(rep(cost.types, 6))

dotchart(heights, col=bar.colors, pch=16, cex=.6)

Thanks for the example, Hadley.  To me, this suggests we should stop
teaching histograms in Stat 101 and instead use quantile plots, which
give excellent results for n=100 and even surprisingly good results
for n=10:

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
for(i in c(10, 100, 1000, 10000)) {
  qqplot(runif(i), qunif(seq(1/i, 1, length=i)), main=i,
         xlim=c(0,1), ylim=c(0,1),
         xlab="runif", ylab="Uniform distribution quantiles")
  abline(0,1,col="lightgray")
}

... which is why all efforts to make folks say "package" instead of >>
"library" << are doomed to fail, IMHO. Besides, in English, "library"
also means "a collection of software or data usually reflecting a
specific theme or application" (#9 on the list from
http://dictionary.reference.com/ ). Therefore:
   > "library" == "package"
   [1] TRUE!
and just about the only way to clear up the "confusion" would be to
rename library() to package(), and replace "library" with "folder" or
"directory".

I made his mouth water mentioning the advantages of using Sweave.

Not using SW myself I wonder if anyone out there has gathered some 
experiences
in using the combination of both.

Thank you in advance

Dietrich

It all depends on what you're trying to do - I don't think histograms
are particularly good as density estimators, but that's not what
you're using them for most of the time! You're using them as an
exploratory tool to try and understand what's going on in your data -
often you'll need to use very small bin widths which help find
unexpected gaps and patterns in your data.   It's helpful to have some
feel for what common distributions look like.

Hi Pedro,

Could you be a bit more explicit about what you're trying to do?  Have
you read the last chapter of the draft ggplot book?

Yes, that works.  Not sure why DBI was unavailable for a simple install 
of geneplotter from the Windows Rgui; when I try it now (on a different 
PC, maybe using a different mirror) it's there.

abs(xloc) typically varies by a factor of about 100 from smallest to 
largest, but sometimes the small end is really small, and so the ratio 
is really big.

I can successfully connect with the my database using the following code

However, when I try to query the database, R breakes.

res<-dbSendQuery(con,'select * from sjlc_ld')

Can anyone help me tune up the connection between R and MySQL?

Thank you,

Another approach which I'm pleased with but was not suggested so far
is jitter + kde2d from MASS:

plot(jitter(x), jitter(y))
if (!exists("kde2d")) require(MASS)
kdesamp <- 20000  #depending on your RAM
forkde <- if (kdesamp < length(x)) sample(1:length(x), kdesamp,
replace=FALSE) else 1:length(x)
d <- kde2d(x[forkde], y[forkde])
contour(d, add=TRUE)

What does *that* means ? You should be a bit more descriptive...

> res<-dbSendQuery(con,'select * from sjlc_ld')

require(MindeReaderAlpha).

Hmmmm ... Isn't the "breakage" just a loooong wait with no answer ? Or
maybe a timeout ?

In which case I'd try to put a semicolon (";")  at the end of the SQL
query, thus making it syntactically valid SQL...

You are right, it was a mistake copying and pasting the code. There is
no error message from R when I run con2. I get a Windows error message
saying "R for windows terminal front-end has encountered a problem and
need to close".

The error signature is:

AppName: rterm.exe	 AppVer: 2.60.43063.0	 ModName: msvcrt.dll
ModVer: 7.0.2600.2180	 Offset: 000378c0

The problem is the missing values.  The argument "na.action" is not active
in princomp(), which I think is a bug, even though the help page claims that
"factory fresh" default is na.omit.

So, you need to either get rid of the rows with any missing values in them,
or use a PCA code that can deal with missing values by somehow imputing
them.

Subject: [R] PCA - "cov.wt(z) : 'x' must contain finite values only"

I am trying to run PCA on a matrix (the first column and row are
headers).  There are several cells with NA's.  When I run PCA with the
following code:
______________________________________
setwd("I:/PCA")
AsianProp<-read.csv("Matrix.csv", sep=",", header=T, row.names=1)
attach(AsianProp)
AsianProp
AsianProp.pca<-princomp(AsianProp, na.omit)
_____________________________________

I get the error message:

cov.wt(z) : 'x' must contain finite values only

What am I doing wrong?  

Thanks very much!

Subject: [R] Scatterplot3d model reporting question
Message-ID: <mn.92967d7c97244a0f.83239@exitcheck.net>

I've used the scatterplot3d function to graph some data and had it 
graph a "smooth" fit. Is there a way to actualy find out the function 
of the surface? I've looked through the help and figured out how to get 
it to report the following:

Family: gaussian
Link function: identity

Formula:
y ~ s(x, z)

Parametric coefficients:
            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept)  0.20750    0.01223   16.97   <2e-16 ***
---
Signif. codes:  0 ?***? 0.001 ?**? 0.01 ?*? 0.05 ?.? 0.1 ? ? 1

Approximate significance of smooth terms:
         edf Est.rank     F  p-value
s(x,z) 8.403       17 9.729 1.76e-14 ***
---
Signif. codes:  0 ?***? 0.001 ?**? 0.01 ?*? 0.05 ?.? 0.1 ? ? 1

R-sq.(adj) =  0.684   Deviance explained = 70.9%
GCV score = 0.017692   Scale est. = 0.016151  n = 108

But I'm still not really sure what I'm looking at, either that or 
"smooth" means something different than I thought. Any help would be 
great!

thanks,

I know there is a function forestplot from rmeta package and also the
plot.meta from the meta package and maybe others, but they are rather
complicated with extra plot parameters that I do not need and also they
process only objects created with other package functions. 
But I wonder if anyone has a much simpler function using the basic plot to
make a forestplot with only a median (or mean) and just the confidence
intervals, something like the data below in graphics. thanks

I hope that you actually haven't got any comma to separate the
thousands... it separates fields in a csv files (as the "Comma
Separated Values" name may suggest). If so, get rid of the commas.

> td<-read.csv("td.csv", header=TRUE)

> contractdate<-read.csv("contractdate.csv", header=TRUE)

You have to coerce the 1-column dataframes created by read.csv to
numeric vectors or to a 60000x3 dataframe.
solution 1:

myData <- cbind(td,contractdate,price)

> library(rgl)

plot3d(mydata)

solution 2:

td <- as.numeric(td)
...
price <- as.numeric(price)
plot3d(td,contractdate,price)

Subject: [R] Specifying starting values in lme (nlme package) using msScale
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.43.0712181202460.11807@hymn11.u.washington.edu>


I am using package nlme and would like to specify initial values for a linear mixed-effects model to help with convergence. I am trying to specify those initial values using the msScale option under ?control? in the lme() function:

lme(Y ~ X1,  random= ~ X1|X2, control=list(msScale=lmeScale))

where, (as far as I understand), lmeScale is a function that can take initial values for parameters. However, I am unsure about how to input those starting values (e.g., what names lme will recognize for fixed and random effects, in what format, and if a partial list of initial values would be acceptable?).

Any advice or examples of code inputting starting values would be extremely helpful. I have been unable to find examples myself online. Note, although it may be easier to do this in the lme4 package, I would prefer to use nlme.

Thank you for your attention.

Dear Max,

I'm guessing that you're actually using scatter3d() in the Rcmdr package rather than scatterplot3d(), since the latter, I believe, doesn't fit regression surfaces.

If I'm right, then as it says in ?scatter3d, the smooth surface is fit by the gam() function in the mgcv package using a smoothing spline and there is no explicit equation to examine. See ?gam for more information.

I hope this helps,
 John

I do not have an up-to-date version of R on my Mac, since I have not yet 
upgraded to OSX10.4. I can try with my older version of R, but failure 
(or even success) with versions OSX-10.2/R-2.0 is not likely to be very 
informative. If you will post an example of the input that is resulting 
in the error, I can try it on my WinXP machine. If we cannot reproduce it 
there, then it may be more appropriate to take further questions to the 
Mac-R mailing list. The error message suggests to me that the fault lies 
in the connection phase of the task.

lapply(1:length(myvector) function(.length) {
c(myvector[1}:myvector[.length])
})

but test it because i didn't.

i'm sorry. i tested it afterwards and of course
it had some problems. below is the working version.


myvector<-c("A","B","C","D","E")

result<- lapply(1:length(myvector), function(.length) {
myvector[1:.length]
})


print(result)

how about scaling your plotting symbols by the sqrt() of their value. or 
see ?bubble in the gstat package.

Note that this fails if length(myvector)==0. 
Good to know the corner cases.

There are two experimental packages available in
http://www.stat.uiowa.edu/~luke/R/experimental: pnmath, based on
OpenMP, and pnmath0, based on basic pthreads. These packages provide
parallelized versions of many of the R vectorized math functions. The
README files in these packages give more details.  OpenMP is I think
the way we want to go in the longer term; there are a few configu
issues that need sorting out and so in the interim a non OpenMP
version might be useful.

Best,

luke

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] Update of the np package (version 0.14-1)
Message-ID: <1198009803.37146.29.camel@pc-racine1.mcmaster.ca>

Dear R users,

An updated version of the np package has recently been uploaded to CRAN
(version 0.14-1). 

The package is briefly described in a recent issue of Rnews (October,
2007, http://cran.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2007-2.pdf) for those
who might be interested.

A somewhat more detailed paper that describes the np package is
forthcoming in the Journal of Statistical Software
(http://www.jstatsoft.org) for those might be interested.

A much more thorough treatment of the subject matter can be found in Li,
Q. and J. S. Racine (2007), Nonparametric Econometrics: Theory and
Practice, Princeton University Press, ISBN: 0691121613 (768 Pages) for
those who might be interested
(http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8355.html)

Information on the np package:

This package provides a variety of nonparametric (and semiparametric)
kernel methods that seamlessly handle a mix of continuous, unordered,
and ordered factor datatypes. We would like to gratefully acknowledge
support from  the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of
Canada (NSERC:www.nserc.ca), the Social Sciences and Humanities Research
Council of Canada (SSHRC:www.sshrc.ca), and the Shared Hierarchical
Academic Research Computing Network (SHARCNET:www.sharcnet.ca).

Changes from version 0.13-1 to 0.14-1:

* now use optim rather than nlm for minimisation in single index and
smooth coefficient models
* fixed bug in klein-spady objective function
* regression standard errors are now available in the case of no
  continuous variables
* summary should look prettier, print additional information
* tidied up lingering issues with out-of-sample data and conditional
modes
* fixed error when plotting asymptotic errors with conditional densities
* fixed a bug in npplot with partially linear regressions and 
plot.behavior='data' or 'plot-data'
* maximum default number of multistarts is now set to 5
* least-squares cross-validation of conditional densities uses a new,
 faster algorithm
* new, faster algorithm for least-squares cross-validation for both 
local-constant and local linear regressions.
   The estimator has changed somewhat: both cross-validation and
   the estimator use a method of shrinking towards the local constant
   estimator rather than the standard ridge approach that shrinks
   towards zero
* optimised smooth coefficient code, added ridging
* fixed bug in uniform CDF kernel
* fixed bug where npindexbw would ignore bandwidth.compute = FALSE and
   compute bandwidths when supplied with a preexisting bw object
* now can handle estimation out of discrete support.
* summary would misreport the values of discrete scale factors which
   were computed with bwscaling = TRUE

We are grateful to John Fox, Achim Zeilies, Roger Koenker, and numerous
users for their valuable feedback which resulted in an improved version
of the package.

Subject: [R] How can I extract the AIC score from a mixed model object
 produced using lmer?
Message-ID: <OFEA565530.971E9869-ON882573B5.00784A2E-882573B5.00797442@fs.fed.us>


I am running a series of candidate mixed models using lmer (package lme4)
and I'd like to be able to compile a list of the AIC scores for those
models so that I can quickly summarize and rank the models by AIC. When I
do logistic regression, I can easily generate this kind of list by creating
the model objects using glm, and doing:

> md <- c("md1.lr", "md2.lr", "md3.lr")
> aic <- c(md1.lr$aic, md2.lr$aic, md3.lr$aic)
> aic2 <- cbind(md, aic)

but when I try to extract the AIC score from the model object produced by
lmer I get:

> md1.lme$aic
NULL
Warning message:
In md1.lme$aic : $ operator not defined for this S4 class, returning NULL

So... How do I query the AIC value out of a mixed model object created by
lmer?

You can calculate the AIC as follows:

(fm1 <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days|Subject), sleepstudy))
aic1 <- AIC(logLik(fm1))

Hope this helps.

Subject: [R] Random forests
Message-ID: <9d4084070712181427y620c12fan12216987613e3dc2@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I would like to use a tree regression method to analyze my dataset. I
am interested in the fact that random forests creates in-bag and
out-of-bag datasets, but I also need an estimate of support for each
split. That seems hard to do in random forests since each tree is
grown using a subset of the predictor variables.

I was thinking of setting mtry = number of predictor variables,
growing several trees, and computing the support for each node as the
number of times that a certain predictor variable was chosen for that
node. Can this be implemented using random forests?

Thanks!

Naiara.

This is pretty easy to do with the ggplot2 package:

library(ggplot2)
qplot(longdeg, latdeg, data = data, facets = . ~ vessek, size = catch)

or maybe
qplot(longdeg, latdeg, data = data, facets = . ~ vessek, size = catch)
+ scale_area()

if you want the area of the points proportional to the catch, rather
than their radius

Subject: [R] Multiple plots with single box
Message-ID: <200712182321.lBINLgYU027646@definetti.ddns.uark.edu>


Hello,

I am trying to display some harmonic functions in a plot. The kind of
display I have in mind is like the one that cn be obtained by a call
to plot.ts with plot.type = "multiple". The only difference is that I
want a single box containing all the plots instead of one box per
plot. I thought box(which = "outer") would have done the job, but it
didn't. 

Below is the code I have used so far. (R 2.5.1, I know, I know...)

Any help is greatly appreciated. 

Thank you in advance,
Giovanni

=================
### Plot harmonic functions
n <- 6 # even
omega <- 2 * pi / n

par(mfrow = c(n - 1, 1), mar = c(0, 5.1, 0, 5.1), oma = c(3, 1, 2, 1))
for (i in 1:(n/2 - 1)) {
    curve(cos(x * i * omega), 0, n, ylim = c(-1.1, 1.1), ylab = "", axes = FALSE)
    points(1:n, cos(i * omega * 1:n))
    axis(2); abline(h = 0, col = "lightgrey")
    curve(sin(x * i * omega), 0, n, ylim = c(-1.1, 1.1), ylab = "", axes = FALSE)
    points(1:n, sin(i * omega * 1:n))
    axis(4); abline(h = 0, col = "lightgrey")
}
curve(cos(x * (n/2) * omega), 0, n, ylim = c(-1.1, 1.1), ylab = "", axes = FALSE)

 From ?cbind:

Data frame methods
The cbind data frame method is just a wrapper for data.frame(..., 
check.names = FALSE). This means that it will split matrix columns in data 
frame arguments, and convert character columns to factors unless 
stringsAsFactors = TRUE is passed.

(I'm guessing 'spectrum' is a data.frame before the code fragment you've shown)

hope this helps,

Whoops, it looks like there's a typo in ?cbind (R version 2.6.0 Patched 
(2007-10-11 r43143)), and I blindly copied it into my message.

That should read (emphasis added):

"and convert character columns to factors unless stringsAsFactors = 
***FALSE***"

Here's an example:

 > x <- data.frame(X=1:3)
 > sapply(cbind(x, letters[1:3]), class)
            X letters[1:3]
    "integer"     "factor"
 > sapply(cbind(x, letters[1:3], stringsAsFactors=FALSE), class)
            X letters[1:3]
    "integer"  "character"
 >

Thanks to Mark Leeds for pointing that out to me in a private message!

(I see this still in the source at 
https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/base/man/cbind.Rd -- is that 
the right place to look for the latest source to make sure it hasn't been 
fixed already?)

Subject: [R] strange timings in convolve(x,y,type="open")
Message-ID: <47686CA0.5090208@stanford.edu>

Dear R-ophiles,

I've found something very odd when I apply convolve
to ever larger vectors.  Here is an example below
with vectors ranging from 2^11 to 2^17.   There is
a funny bump up at 2^12.  Then it gets very slow at 2^16.


 >  for( i in 11:20 )print( system.time(convolve(1:2^i,1:2^i,type="o")))
   user  system elapsed
  0.002   0.000   0.002
   user  system elapsed
  0.373   0.002   0.375
   user  system elapsed
  0.014   0.001   0.016
   user  system elapsed
  0.031   0.002   0.034
   user  system elapsed
  0.126   0.004   0.130
   user  system elapsed
194.095   0.013 194.185
   user  system elapsed
  0.345   0.011   0.356

This example is run on a fedora machine with 64 bits.  I hit the same
wall at 2^16 on a Macbook (Intel processor I think).  The fedora machine
is running R 2.5.0.  That's a bit old (April 07) but I saw no mention of 
this speed
problem in some web searching, and it's not mentioned in the 2.6
what's new notes.

I've rerun it and found the same bump at 12 and wall at 16.
The timing at 2^16  can change appreciably.  In one
other case it was about 270 user, 271 elapsed.
The 2^18 case ran for hours without ever finishing.

At first I thought that this was a memory latency issue.  Maybe it
is.  But that makes it hard to explain why 2^17 works better than
2^16.  I've seen that three times now, so I'm almost ready to call it 
reproducible.
Also, one of the machines I'm using has lots of memory.  Maybe it's
a cache issue ... but that still does not explain why 2^12 is slower
than 2^13 or 2^16 is slower than 2^17.

I've checked by running convolve without type="o" and I don't
see the wall.  Similarly fft does not have that problem.

Here's an example without type="open"
 > for( k in 11:20)print(system.time( convolve( 1:2^k,1:2^k)))
   user  system elapsed
  0.001   0.000   0.000
   user  system elapsed
  0.001   0.000   0.001
   user  system elapsed
  0.002   0.000   0.002
   user  system elapsed
  0.004   0.000   0.004
   user  system elapsed
  0.009   0.001   0.010
   user  system elapsed
  0.017   0.001   0.018
   user  system elapsed
  0.138   0.005   0.143
   user  system elapsed
  0.368   0.012   0.389
   user  system elapsed
  1.010   0.032   1.051
   user  system elapsed
  1.945   0.069   2.015

This is more what I expected.  Something like N or N log(N) , with
the difference hard to discern in granularity and noise.

The convolve function is not very big (see below).  When type is
not specified, it defaults to "circular".  So my guess is that something
mysterious might be happening inside the first else clause below,
at least on some architectures.

To access your dimension idx you could do either
assign("a",paste("dimnames(y)$x",idx,sep=""))
or
eval(parse(text=paste("a<-dimnames(y)$x",idx,sep="")))

You don't want to be down at the C level, most likely:  it would be much 
more straightforward and programmer-efficient to use one of the available 
bindings to one of the available open-source databases.

R has useful / usable bindings to postgresql, sqlite, and mysql, among 
many others.

These are, however, more generally useful when you reach the point that 
you simply can't manage the volume of your data in R objects or in data 
frames. [And, well, you can go a LONG way with intelligently named R 
objects.  :-)]

	with names changing with	"i"
Message-ID: <WorldClient-F200712182124.AA24320054@epimgh.mcgill.ca>

Dear R users,

I am analysing a very large data set and I need to perform several data
manipulations. The dataset is so big that the only way I can play with it
without having memory problems (E.g. "cannot allocate vectors of size...")
is to write a batch script to:

1. cut the data into pieces 
2. save the pieces in seperate .RData files
3. Remove everything from the environment
4. load one of the piece
5. perform the manipulations on it
6. save it and remove it from the environment
7. Redo 4-6 for every piece
8. Merge everything together at the end

It works if coded line by line but since I'll have to perform these tasks
on other data sets, I am trying to automate this as much as I can. 

I am using a loop in which I used 'assign' and 'get' (pseudo code below).
My problem is when I use 'get', it prints the whole object on the screen.
I am wondering whether there is a more efficient way to do what I need to
do. Any help would be appreciated. Please keep in mind that the whole
process is quite computer-intensive, so I can't keep everything in the
environment while R performs calculations.

Say I have 1 big dataframe called data. I use 'split' to divide it into a
list of 12 dataframes (call this list my.list)

my.fun is a function that takes a dataframe, performs several
manipulations on it and returns a dataframe.


for (i in 1:12){
  assign( paste( "data", i, sep=""),  my.fun(my.list[i]))   # this works
  # now I need to save this new object as a RData. 

  # The following line does not work
  save(paste("data", i, sep = ""),  file = paste(  paste("data", i, sep =
""), "RData", sep="."))
}

  # This works but it is a bit convoluted!!!
  temp <- get(paste("data", i, sep = ""))
  save(temp,  file = "lala.RData")
}


I am *sure* there is something more clever to do but I can't find it. Any
help would be appreciated.

best regards,

MP

Thank you for your response!

'write.table' writes up to 15 decimal digits which is
not the machine (double) precision but not far from
that - sorry for the misleading comments!

After all I found a way to do what I needed without
using disk or much memory and doing only twice as much
work as I could with unlimited memory, so I will stick
to this approach.

The time is consumed by fft, which is called with vectors of length 
2*2^i-1 when type = 'o'

There are no factors of 2^13-1 or 2^17-1 or 2^18-1

It looks like the code in fft.c tries to find factors of the series length 
and works from there.

So, the size of the problem evidently depends on its factors.

Thanks Charles.  That must be it.  (Berwin also
noticed this.)

When convolve hit the wall, I switched over
to FFTW in C.  That is actually pretty nice
code which runs in n log(n) even for prime n
and takes special account of factors of n up
to about 19 or so.  So if the R team ever wants
to put in a new FFT, that looks like a good one.

But I think easier fix for me, or others in this boat,
would just be to write a new convolve(x,y) that
pads x and y with zeros out to length
2*max( length(x), length(y) ).  Then if x and y
have very composite lengths, especially powers of
2, the fft should go quickly.

Subject: [R] median of binned values
Message-ID: <4768E19B.8090204@geo.uzh.ch>

Dear list,
I have a vector (array, table row, whatever is best) of frequency values 
for categories (or bins), and I need to find the median category. 
Trivial to do by hand, but I was wondering if there is a means to  do it 
in R in an elegant way.

The obvious medioan(vector) returns the median frequency for the binns, 
and that is not what I want. i.e,:
             freq
cat1    1
cat2   10  
cat3   100  
cat4   1000
cat5   10000

I want it to return cat5, instead of cat3.

Thanks a lot
Martin

Subject: [R] Different labels by panel in barchart
Message-ID: <OF4C1A6466.345BD6D1-ON802573B5.00660E3E-802573B6.00338775@hsl.gov.uk>

Dear all,

I'm analysing a survey, and creating a barchart of the different responses 
for each question.  The questions are grouped according to a number of 
categories, so I'm using lattice to create a plot with each question in a 
category on it.  The problem is that the response set for different 
questions within the same category varies.  I want to be able to draw only 
the relevant bars, without spaces for nonrelevant reposnes.  An example 
may make it clearer:

testdf = data.frame(y=c(23,34,45, 56), x=factor(c("a", "a", "b", "c")), 
g=factor(c(1,2,1,2)))
barchart(y~x|g, data=testdf)

#In the first panel I would like two columns "a" and "b", positioned at 1 
and 2 respectively; in the second I would again like two columns at 1 and 
2, this time labelled "a" and "c".

barchart(y~x|g, data=testdf, scales=list(x=list(relation="free")), 
drop.unused.levels=TRUE)

#This is closer, but puts the columns in the wrong place in the second 
panel.

Regards,
Richie.

Subject: [R] array addition
Message-ID: <3972DD82-222B-4640-B299-62D9BBF0D9F4@noc.soton.ac.uk>

Hi

suppose I have two arrays x1,x2 of dimensions a1,b1,c1 and
a2,b2,c2 respectively.

I want  x = x1   "+"   x2 with dimensions c(max(a1,a2), max(b1,b2),max 
(c1,c2))

with

x[a,b,c] = x1[a1,b1,c1] + x2[a2,b2,c2] if    a <=min(a1,a2) , b<=min 
(b1,b2), c<=min(c1,c2)

and the other bits either x1 or x2 or zero according to whether the  
coordinates
are "in range" for x1 or x2 or neither.

The answer has to work for arbitrary-dimensioned arrays.

toy example follows (matrices):


 > x1
      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1    3    5    7    9
[2,]    2    4    6    8   10
 > x2
      [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    4    7
[2,]    2    5    8
[3,]    3    6    9
 > x
      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    2    7   12    7    9
[2,]    4    9   14    8   10
[3,]    3    6    9    0    0
 >


Note the zeros at lower-right.


Is there a ready-made solution to this?

Hi Naiara,

I'm so not an expert here, but what you propose with mty = number of
predictors will give you a procedure known as bagging.

You talk about support for the split and then for the node. Is this just
a typo or are you interested in the two different things?

I'm not aware of how you do the latter in bagging or random forests as
the whole point is to grow large trees not pruned ones. As to the
former, trees are unstable, change the data used to train them just a
little and you can get a very different fitted tree.

Bagging and random forests exploit this to produce a better prediction
machine / classifier by using n poor trees rather than one best tree.
They do this by adding randomness to the procedure by bootstrap sampling
the training data, and in the case of random forest, randomly sampling a
small number, mtry, of available predictors to grow each tree. As such
there is no correspondence between the splits of one tree and the splits
of another, so trying to compare how many times a certain split in one
or more trees is formed by the same predictor. So it doesn't make sense
(to me it may to others) to focus on individual splits in the n trees.

I don't know what you mean exactly by "support", but if you are trying
to get a measure of how important each of your predictors is in
explaining variance in your response, then take a look at the
importance() function in the randomForest package. This produces a
couple of measures that allow you to determine which predictors
contribute most to reducing node impurity or MSE.

Someone asked about R on the EEE PC. That was the second thing
I installed when I received mine (the first being the full KDE desktop).
I don't recall any issues with the installation. I used the standard debian
package (the native linux on the EEE is Xandros, a derivation of debian).
The caveat being that since Xandros isn't *exactly* debian, there might
be some issues, but I haven't run into any yet. Note that I haven't tried
anything particularly taxing, so take this with a grain of salt.

R seems to run fine, the only problem I've encountered so far has been
that since the screen size is 800x480, plots are longer than the window, so
you only see part of them. I haven't tried changing the default plot size
(I assume that can be done).

It does get warm to the touch quickly, but nothing I found unbearable.
I can't report on battery life, since I haven't really put it through 
its paces
yet -- maybe I'll report again after Christmas at the inlaws ... ;)

The svyquantile function will give you the median, e.g.
svyquantile(~b, design, 0.5, interval.type="score")

Since a proportion is just the mean of a 0/1 variable, you can use 
svymean for that, e.g.
svymean(~b1, design)

Is this what you want?

## some example data
dat <- cumsum(rnorm(100))
start.end <- as.Date(c("01/01/2007", "31/12/2007"), format = "%d/%m/%Y")
dates <- seq(start.end[1], start.end[2], length = 100)

## plot the data
plot(dat ~ dates, type = "l")

Thank you, Chuck,
would you mind commenting a bit on the code, it is not all clear... HOw 
would you go to retrieve only the numeric value (not the category name)?
I am just starting with R, and the functionality of replicate and levels 
is not quite clear. I tried the documentation, but am not any wiser. 
What if I had a vector v <- vector(c(1,10,100,1000,10000)) and wanted to 
perform it on that?

Thanks a lot
Martin

Subject: [R]  scale estimation for Gamma distribution
Message-ID: <14414551.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hey,
I make a regression for Gamma distribution with log link, in R and in SAS.
In R, the dispersion is estimated by 
\phi=Deviance/(#_of_observations),
In SAS, there are two options: 
\phi=Deviance/(#_of_observations-#_of_params) or
\phi=Pearson/(#_of_observations-#_of_params).

I understand that SAS formulae are correct, however, the coefficients,
obtained by R and by the first version of SAS, are equal, and the difference
is only in standard errors of betas.
Could anyone explain me the phenomenon? Maybe, there is smth. about the
Gamma distribution?

Hi,

What you might want is something like this:

library(maps)
data(world2MapEnv)
map("world2",xlim=c(110,160),ylim=c(-45,-10))
axis(1)
axis(2)
library(plotrix)
draw.circle(155,-30,1,col="red")
draw.circle(155,-32,1.2,col="blue")
draw.circle(153,-34,1.5,col="green")

where 1, 1.2, 1.5 are the relative sizes of catch.
Oh, and you would probably want the North Atlantic part of the map...

?"%%" to see how to get the remainder.  You might put the "result" and
remainder together in a function like this:

myfunc <- function(x,y){list(result = floor(x / y), remainder = x %% y)}

myfunc(x=50, y=12)
$result
[1] 4

$remainder
[1] 2

Hello R Users,

    I am interested in using R to generate quantitative structure-activity
relationships (QSARs) for small molecules given a set of molecular
descriptors and biological data tab-delimited or excel file. In which fist
value colum of each row is biological value and rest all are its
descriptors.

    Has anyone done this using R ? Would you be willing to share your R
scripts (or ideas) for doing this with me ?
I am particularly interested in R codes for optimizing variable selection as
well as validation of the generated QSAR equations, since
I have ~ 1500 molecular descriptors per molecule. How I can use R to find
the optimal (smallest) set of descriptors to fit the data ?
If you have any idea about this using other software the please also
suggest me.
I am a new user of R. I am trying to use R for this. Please reply me at
this mail ID because I have not joined R help group.
Thanking you

    cmd2 <- paste("out[", filter2, "]", sep="")

    out <- array(0, dim=pmax(dim1,dim2)) 
    eval(parse(text=paste(cmd1, "<-", cmd1, "+ x1")))
    eval(parse(text=paste(cmd2, "<-", cmd2, "+ x2")))
    out
  }

x1 <- array(round(5*runif(30)), dim=c(2,3,5))
x2 <- array(round(5*runif(24)), dim=c(3,4,2))
x <- x1 %add% x2

You probably want to add a check to make the dimensions the same, and the 
code needs tidying, but you get the idea.

Subject: [R] randomForest() for regression produces offset predictions
Message-ID: <200712191143.59625.j.knowles@manchester.ac.uk>

Hi all,
 
I have observed that when using the randomForest package to do regression, the 
predicted values of the dependent variable given by a trained forest are not 
centred and have the wrong slope when plotted against the true values.
 
This means that the R^2 value obtained by squaring the Pearson correlation are 
better than those obtained by computing the coefficient of determination 
directly. The R^2 value obtained by squaring the Pearson can, however, be 
exactly reproduced by the coeff. of det. if the predicted values are first 
linearly transformed (using lm() to find the required intercept and slope).
 
Does anyone know why the randomForest behaves in this way - producing offset 
predictions? Does anyone know a fix for the problem?
 
(By the way, the feature is there even if the original dependent variable 
values are initially transformed to have zero mean and unit variance.)
 
As an example, here is some simple R code that uses the available swiss 
dataset to show the effect I am observing.

Thanks for any help.
 
--
#### EXAMPLE OF RANDOM FOREST REGRESSION
 
library(randomForest)
data(swiss)
swiss
 
#Build the random forest to predict Infant Mortality
rf.rf<-randomForest(Infant.Mortality ~ ., data=swiss)
 
#And predict the training set again
pred<-c(predict(rf.rf,swiss))
actual<-swiss$Infant.Mortality
 
#Plotting predicted against actual values shows the effect (uncomment to see
this)
#plot(pred,actual)
#abline(0,1)
 
# calculate R^2 as pearson coefficient squared
R2one<-cor(pred,actual)^2
 
# calculate R^2 value as fraction of variance explained
residOpt<-(actual-pred)
residnone<-(actual-mean(actual))
R2two<-1-var(residOpt,na.rm=TRUE)/var(residnone, na.rm=TRUE)
 
# now fit a line through the predicted and true values and
# use this to normalize the data before calculating R^2
 
fit<-lm(actual ~ pred)
coef(fit)
pred2<-pred*coef(fit)[2]+coef(fit)[1]
residOpt<-(actual-pred2)
R2three<-1-var(residOpt,na.rm=TRUE)/var(residnone, na.rm=TRUE)
 
cat("Pearson squared = ",R2one,"\n")
cat("Coeff of determination = ", R2two, "\n")
cat("Coeff of determination after linear fitting = ", R2three, "\n")

  Retrieve the numeric value rather than the category name as follows:

with(df, freq[median(rep(as.numeric(binname), freq))])
[1] 10000

  To do essentially the same thing with a vector:

myvec <- c(1,10,100,1000,10000)

myvec[median(rep(1:length(myvec), myvec))]
[1] 10000

  I'm sure I cannot explain levels() and rep() any better than the help
pages for those functions.

Subject: [R] recode based on filter
Message-ID: <200712191351.24056.dgvirtual@akl.lt>

Hi, I have a data frame DATA, which (simplified of course) looks like this:

know1 = c("Y","N","N","Y","N","N","Y","Y","N")
par1=c(1,4,5,3,3,2,3,3,5)
know2 = c("Y","Y","N","Y","N","N","N","Y","Y")
par2=c(3,4,4,3,5,2,4,3,2)
DATA=data.frame(know1,par1,know2,par2)

it represents answers in a questionnaire, where respondents evaluate two 
things (par1 and par2) but they also indicate, whether they have detailed 
knowledge about those two things (know1 and know2).

I need to test correlations between parameters par1 and par2, but need to do 
that separately for cases where the respondents know about both things and 
where they do not know about both things. If, testing correlations of those 
who do know, a respondent knows only about item1 and not item2 (if the 
responces do not match), the values of par1 and par2 should be changed to 
NA's. The same goes if the respondent says he does not know only about one 
thing.

SO: Before doing analysis, I need to transform the DATA dataframe in two ways:

Testing correlations of those evaluating with knowledge:

> DATA
  know1 par1 know2 par2
1     Y    1     Y    3
2     N    NA    Y    NA
3     N    NA    N    NA
4     Y    3     Y    3
5     N    NA    N    NA
6     N    NA    N    NA
7     Y    NA    N    NA
8     Y    3     Y    3
9     N    NA    Y    NA

And the case of those evaluating without knowledge:

> DATA
  know1 par1 know2 par2
1     Y    NA    Y    NA
2     N    NA    Y    NA
3     N    5     N    4
4     Y    NA    Y    NA
5     N    3     N    5
6     N    2     N    2
7     Y    NA    N    NA
8     Y    NA    Y    NA
9     N    NA    Y    NA

Yes, yes, this example is stupid, but...

I know how to filter records, I know how to recode, but I need some 
combination of the two here and I am lost.. Any ideas?

Perhaps you can try subset the data:

sapply(levels(DATA$know1), function(x)subset(DATA, (know1==x &
know2==x)), simplify=F)

Here is an example of plotting the number of observations per month.
You can change this to any period you want.

# create some test data
x.d <- as.Date("2000-1-1") + runif(1000, 1, 500)
# create buckets of one month (or whatever period you want)
x.cut <- cut(x.d, breaks=seq(as.Date('2000-1-1'), max(x.d)+7, by="1 month"))
# plot the data
barplot(table(x.cut), main="Observations Per Month")

Subject: [R] Correlation when one variable has zero variance (polychoric?)
Message-ID: <op.t3k14iql4hcap5@dollar>

Hi,

I'm running this for a simulation study, so many combinations of parameter  
produce many predictions that I need to correlate with data.

The problem
----------------
I'm using rating data with 3 to 5 categories (e.g., too low, correct, too  
high). The underlying continuous scales should be normal, so I chose the  
polychoric correlation. I'm using library(polychor) in its latest version  
0.7.4

The problem is that sometimes the models predict always the same value  
(i.e., the median). Example frequency table:

> table(med$ADRI_LAN, rate$ADRI_LAN)
       2   3   4   5
   3  28 179 141  50

That is, there is no variability in one of the variables (the only value  
is 3, the median).

Pearson Product Moment Correlation consists of the covariation divided by  
the square root of the product of the standard deviations of the two  
variables. If the standard deviation of one of the variables is zero, then  
the denominator is zero and the correlation cannot be computed. R returns  
NA and a warning.

If I add jitter to the variable with no variability, then I get a  
virtually zero, but calculable, Pearson correlation.

However, when I use the polychoric correlation (using the default  
settings), I get just the opposite: a very high correlation!

> polychoric    = polychor( med$ADRI_LAN, rate$ADRI_LAN ) #, ML=T,  
> std.err=T
> polychoric
[1] 0.999959

This is very counterintuitive. I also ran the same analysis in 2005 (what  
has changed in the package polycor since then, I don't know) and the  
results were different. I think back then I contrasted them with SAS and  
they were the same. Maybe the approximation fails in extreme cases where  
most of the cells are zero? Maybe the approximation was not used in the  
first releases of the package? But it seems that the ML estimator doesn't  
work at all (at least in the current version of the package) with those  
tables when most cells are zero due to no variability on one variable):

> polychor(med$ADRI_LAN, rate$ADRI_LAN, ML=T)
Error in tab * log(P) : non-conformable arrays

I've seen some posts where sparse tables were trouble, eg:  
http://www.nabble.com/polychor-error-td5954345.html#a5954345
  "You're expecting a lot out of ML to get estimates of the first couple of  
thresholds for rows and the first for columns. [which were mostly zeroes]"

Are the polychoric estimates using the approximation completely wrong? Is  
there any way to compute a polychoric correlation with such a dataset?  
What should I conclude from data like these?
Maybe using correlation is not the right thing to do.

Thanks,
-Jose

Rank correlation measures are for correlating a continuous or ordinal 
prediction with a response (continuous, ordinal, or binary).  So you 
should be able to do something like rcorr.cens(predict(fit), 
as.numeric(Y), outx=TRUE).  Note that rcorr is all lower case.  This 
assumes that the levels of Y are in order, as does lrm.

Note that the new version of lrm has a method for getting predicted mean 
scores from an ordinal lrm.

This is simply a bug in polychor(), which currently does the following test:

  if (r < 1) stop("the table has fewer than 2 rows")
  if (c < 2) stop("the table has fewer than 2 columns")

That is, my intention was to check (r < 2) and report an error. Actually, it
would probably be better to return NA and report a warning.

I don't entirely follow this. Are you referring to the table above with one
row, more generally to table with zero marginals, or to tables in which
there are interior zeroes?

When there are zero marginals the ML estimate cannot be unique since there
is zero information about one or more of the thresholds.

Yes. If there is a zero marginal, then it shouldn't have been computed in
the first place (and was due to the error that I mentioned).

I'd say no. There is no information in the data about the correlation.

That the data aren't informative about the parameters of interest.

Presumably the normally distributed latent variables that underlie the table
have some correlation, but you can't estimate it from the data.

I'll fix polycor() (and put it a test for 0 marginals as well as single-row
or -column tables) -- thanks for the bug report.

John

Subject: [R] Standard input and R
Message-ID: <7229BBA9-0901-4D74-A6B7-E9BB0479E4C2@ucl.ac.uk>

Dear all,

I am trying to wrap a *nix shell script around R for a particular  
purpose, for which I need to get R to execute predetermined commands  
but retain interactivity and allow user input during their execution.  
A straight redirection of standard input is therefore not appropriate,  
and I don't think "littler" is the solution because I don't want to  
write an independent R script.

What I want is effectively something like what ruby does with the '-e'  
option:

$ ruby -e 'gets'
<waits for input from terminal>

R seems to accept an '-e' option too, even though I can't see it  
mentioned in the output from 'R -h', but it doesn't work the same:

$ R --slave --vanilla -e 'scan(what=character(0),nlines=1,quiet=T)'
character(0)
$

The only way I can get this to work is by creating an .Rprofile file  
containing the commands I want to run, but this is suboptimal for a  
number of reasons: I have difficulties if an .Rprofile already exists  
in the working directory, the default packages are not loaded, and the  
process doesn't quit if stop() is called.

I have a vague inkling that this may be achievable with a

For those interested in using R with a remote MySQL database, here's the most 
simple and straightforward solution (thanks to Gabor):

On the console, forward local port 3307 to remote port 3306
ssh -L 3307:xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:3306 myuser at xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

(where xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the IP of the remote server and myuser is the login 
name). After entering the password, keep that console open.

In R:

library(RMySQL)
drv <- dbDriver("MySQL")
dbConnect(drv, user="mysqluser", password="mysqlpassword", 
dbname="anydatabase", host="127.0.0.1", port="3307")

(where mysqluser and mysqlpassword are the remote machine's MySQL username and 
password).

Another possible solution is suggested by Prof. Ripley, using stunnel to 
create a secure tunnel between the local and the remote machines, but I 
haven't explored that in detail.


Best wishes,
Adrian

Is AIC() [extractAIC()] "valid" for models with random effects? I noticed
that the help page for extractAIC() does not list models with random
effects. I think this boils down to the difference between the likelihoods
for models with and without random effects, and I don't know. Just
curious...

Err, I am late to this but

 dbConnect(drv, user="mysqluser", password="mysqlpassword", dbname="anydatabase", host="xxx.xxx.xxx")

works fine for me (eg on Ubuntu with a remote MySQL on some other
box).  What's the problem you were seeing?

Subject: [R] library(rpart) or library(tree)
Message-ID: <47695185.25095.209620F@ingoholz.uni-hohenheim.de>

Hi,

 I have a problem with library (rpart) (and/or library(tree)).

 I use a data.frame with variables
"pnV22" (observation: 1, 0 or yes, no)
"JTemp" (mean temperature)
"SNied"  (summer rain)

 I used function "rpart" to build a model:

	library(rpart)
	attach(data.frame)
	result <- rpart(pnV22 ~ JTemp + SNied)

 I got the following tree:

  n=55518 (50 observations deleted due to missingness)

node), split, n, deviance, yval
      * denotes terminal node

 1) root 55518 668.744500 0.0121942400  
   2) punkte[["JTemp"]]< 10.35 51251  18.992960 0.0003707245 *
   3) punkte[["JTemp"]]>=10.35 4267 556.532000 0.1542067000  
     6) punkte[["SNied"]]>=450 3136 291.318600 0.1036352000 *
     7) punkte[["SNied"]]< 450 1131 234.954900 0.2944297000  
      14) punkte[["JTemp"]]>=10.55 723 113.502100 0.1950207000 *
      15) punkte[["JTemp"]]< 10.55 408 101.647100 0.4705882000  
        30) punkte[["JTemp"]]< 10.45 48   4.479167 0.1041667000 *
        31) punkte[["JTemp"]]>=10.45 360  89.863890 0.5194444000 *

 I constructed a simple new.data.frame:

     new.data.fame <- data.frame
     new.data.frame[,"JTemp"] <- 10.5
     new.data.frame[,"SNied"] <- 430

Than I used predict() to predict values for "pnV22" in the following way:

    pred <- predict(result, data.frame)
    pred2 <- predict(result, new.data.frame)

The results are the same, which I checked by ploting the values of pred and pred2 and by

   table(pred ==pred2)  which is true for all values.

Looking at the tree I would expect that pred2 has the same high value for all elements of the 
vector. Did I make a mistake?

Thanks, Ingo

You need to do the dropping of the levels separately for each panel:

barchart(y~x|g, data = testdf, scales=list(x=list(relation="free")),
         prepanel = function(x, y, ...) {
             x <- x[, drop = TRUE]
             prepanel.default.bwplot(x, y, ...)
         },
         panel = function(x, y, ...) {
             x <- x[, drop = TRUE]
             panel.barchart(x, y, ...)
         })

I think if you use Gabor's suggested addtion of
add.missing to the original cast command you get what
you want.

cast(dfm, ... ~ Var3, add.missing=TRUE)

Hi,

Hello everyone!
 
Is anybody can help me to solve this silly question that unfortunately I haven't found the right way to address it.
 
Supose I have a matrix X[n,n] dimension
 
I would like to calculate the product of the vectors
 
Y=X[1,n]*X[n,1]
 
Then I would like to run the following operation
 
H=if(Y>0) {H[,1]=1}
 
The problem is that the condition "if" works only for the first element of the matrix.
 
Does anybody knows how to apply the conditional "if" to a entire vector?
 
cheers
 
Guillermo

The remote host expects a login username and password (different from the 
MySQL username and password), which I cannot provide in the dbConnect 
function.
The solution is to first login to the external machine (a secure login using 
ssh), forwarding the MySQL port 3306 to the local port 3307 (not to interfere 
with the local MySQL server), and connecting R to the remote MySQL server 
using the ssh tunneling binded to local port 3307.

Best,
Adi

Hi,

I'm sorry I'm also coming late to this discussion, but  like Dirk, I
fail to understand what's wrong with using dbConnect() the way
the documentation, (see ?MySQL) suggests.

RMySQL was developed in a fully distributed client/server
environment, and it uses the MySQL-provided client API.  The
options that the MySQL client library allows (user, password, host,
port or socket file, compression, etc.) should work from RMySQL
(RMySQL just passes those directly to the MySQL client library).
If you have a specific (e.g., security-related) need that the MySQL client
API does not address, then the use of ssh may be the proper way
to go.  But for simple, vanilla style of client-server communications
the underlying MySQL client should be sufficient.

Regards,

Normally yes, you are right, but this particular MySQL server does not allow 
remote connections (it does not directly listens to port 3306) but only local 
connections using a socket (this terminology is unfamiliar to me, I may talk 
stupid).
So I have to first create a secure login and only after that connect to the 
remote MySQL server.

I hope my situation is more clear now,
Adrian

Yes, that case is sometimes used on internet-facing or otherwise
widely visible machines where the number of open ports is to be
minimised.

In fact, this may be worth adding as a hint in the DBI or RMySQL
docs...

Subject: [R] unexpected behavior from gzfile and unz
Message-ID: <112228.85376.qm@web52507.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

I get unexpected behavior from "readLines()" and
"scan()" depending on how the file is opened with
"gzfile" or "unz".  More specifically:

> file <- gzfile("file.gz")
> readLines(file,1)
[1] "a\tb\tc"
> readLines(file,1)
[1] "a\tb\tc"
> close(file)

It seems that the stream is rewound between calls to
readLines.  The same is true if I replace readLines
with scan.

However, if I set argument 'open="r"', then rewinding
does not occur:

> file <- gzfile("file.gz",open="r")
> readLines(file,1)
[1] "a\tb\tc"
> readLines(file,1)
[1] "1\t2\t3"
> close(file)

Once again, I get the same behavior for scan.  The
rewinding behavior just described also appears if I
open a zip file with "unz".

> file <- unz("file.zip", "file.txt")
> readLines(file,1)
[1] "a\tb\tc"
> readLines(file,1)
[1] "a\tb\tc"
> close(file)

If I add the 'open="r"' argument to the call then I
get an error from readLines:

> file <- unz("file.zip", "file.txt", open="r")
> readLines(file,1)
Error in readLines(file, 1) : seek not enabled for
this connection
> close(file)


> file <- unz("file.zip", "file.txt", open="rb")
> readLines(file,1)
Error in readLines(file, 1) : seek not enabled for
this connection
> close(file)

However, if I instead use "scan" to read the file,
then there are no errors and I get the rewind/no
rewind behavior described above.

> file <- unz("file.zip", "file.txt")
> scan(file,nlines=1,sep="\t",what=character(0))
Read 3 items
[1] "a" "b" "c"
> scan(file,nlines=1,sep="\t",what=character(0))
Read 3 items
[1] "a" "b" "c"
> close(file)


> file <- unz("file.zip", "file.txt", open="r")
> scan(file,nlines=1,sep="\t",what=character(0))
Read 3 items
[1] "a" "b" "c"
> scan(file,nlines=1,sep="\t",what=character(0))
Read 3 items
[1] "1" "2" "3"
> close(file)

Is this a bug?

I figured out the problem: functions
gzfile/unz/file/... create a connection to a file but
do not *open* the connection unless the 'open'
argument  is specified.  

... a little R gotcha for people who use other
programming languages and expect similar
concepts/behavior.

I would suggest a slightly different format. Here's an example with
one set of limits; you can add another set similarly. If you really
want a single panel, you could use panel.segments().

barchart(percent_below ~ factor(Year) | factor(season, levels=unique(season)),
         data= dataset1, origin = 0, layout = c(4, 1),
         upper_2007 = c(6, 4, 5, 3),
         panel = function(..., upper_2007) {
             panel.abline(h = upper_2007[packet.number()])
             panel.barchart(...)
         })

Subject: [R] lattice: axes drawn when relation='free' or relation='sliced'
	but not when relation='same'
Message-ID: <fkc0gq$5s0$1@ger.gmane.org>


I'm using lattice to draw a multi-panel figure: 5 rows, 4 columns.  The y-axis for each panel is determined by

  yaxs            <- list(draw=T
                          , labels=c(0, '.5', '1', '1.5')
                          , at=c(0, .5, 1, 1.5)
                          , tck=c(.4, 0)
                          , cex=.7
                          , alternating=2
                          , relation='same'
                          , rot=90)

fig1 <- xyplot( [...], scales=list(x=xaxs, y=yaxs))

I want this to draw ticks and labels on the left-hand side of each panel.  Instead, I get ticks on the left-hand side of only the
panels in the leftmost column, and labels only on the right-hand side of the rightmost column.  What can account for that?

What seems especially peculiar is that when I change relation to 'sliced' or 'free', the axes are drawn as I want them to be drawn.

The data that I'm plotting are numeric and range from -.3 to 1.9.  I'm using R 2.6.1 and lattice 0.17-2 on Windows XP.

Thank you,
--John

Account for what? What you have described is a fundamental aspect of
the design of Trellis graphics (which clearly happens to be different
from how you would have designed it, but so what?).

Well, doesn't seem very peculiar to me.

If you want the same limits in every panel even when relation="free",
put in an explicit ylim=c(-0.2, 2) or something similar.

R does this sort of thing easily without any parse/eval acrobatics needed. 
  E.g., you can do:

 > stu <- function(x) {return( 1 + (2*x*x) - (3*x) )}
 > (x <- 0:3)
[1] 0 1 2 3
 > stu(x)
[1]  1  0  3 10

[1]  1  0  3 10
 > # if you want to be able use a character-data name for the function:
 > metafun2 <- function(FUN, data) {if (is.character(FUN)) FUN <- 
getFunction(FUN); FUN(data)}
 > metafun2("stu", x)
[1]  1  0  3 10
 > metafun2(stu, x)
[1]  1  0  3 10
 >

What went wrong with your code was that your parse() constructed a list of 
4 expressions, and evaluating that returned the value of the last one:

 > (fun <- "stu")
[1] "stu"
 > paste( fun, "(", x, ")", sep = "" )
[1] "stu(0)" "stu(1)" "stu(2)" "stu(3)"
 > parse( text = paste( fun, "(", x, ")", sep = "" ) )
expression(stu(0), stu(1), stu(2), stu(3))
attr(,"srcfile")
<text>
 >

(Others have observed that in a very large proportion of the situations 
where people reach for parse/eval, there's a neater, cleaner & more direct 
way of doing the job.)

I have a search procedure that evaluates the fitness of each point it reaches as it moves along, and decides where to move next based on its fitness evaluation.  I want to be able to pass different fitness functions to this procedure.  I am trying to find a good way to do this.  I was thinking of passing in the name of the function and then using eval.  However, I haven't gotten this to work the way I'd like it to.  Consider the following example:

When I tried to pass stu and x to a procedure that would evaluate stu(x) I only get stu(x[N]), when N is the last element of x.  What am I doing wrong?  Is there a better way to pass function references?

You appear to have fitted a regression tree, which does not seem to be 
what your interpretation of 'pnV22' requires.

I have little idea what you actually did, but am confident that it is not 
what you claim you did.

Also, note fortune("dog"):

Firstly, don't call your matrix 'matrix'. Would you call your dog 'dog'?
Anyway, it might clash with the function 'matrix'.

It is not finding the new values from the new data frame: they do not have

If all your entries are double precision then you are
using 8 bytes per entry, so 20,000*n entries are just
160,000*n bytes, i.e. less than 160*n Kb. If your n is
100 you get 16 Mb which is not that much (especially
if you pre-allocate it only once). So just use the
matrix and don't worry!

Colleagues

I would like to use the user contributed package "clim.pact". I'm having
trouble with the dependency of "clim.pact" on "ncdf". Like others I am
finding that R CMD INSTALL does not find the netcdf.h file, even when
the directory (/usr/local/include) holding the netcdf.h file is passed to
R CMD.

Unless I misunderstood one of the postings there was an error
related to this problem on the OSX
build of the ncdf package 
<http://osdir.com/ml/lang.r.mac/2006-09/msg00012.html>.

I've install the obvious netcdf packages and
dependencies on ubuntu and the ncdump works fine.

Has anyone solved this problem on linux?

Best fishes

In your first case you seem to be missing a comma after the "^2"; also
missing value for 'y'.  Probably should be something like:

optimize(function(x,y)
((327.727-(1-0.114^10)*y*(1-x)/x/(1-x^y))+(9517.336-327.727
*(1+(1-x)*(1+y)/x-327.727)))^2,
interval=c(0,1), y=1)

Subject: [R] Question about which kind of plot to use
Message-ID: <mn.9b737d7cee7588f6.83239@exitcheck.net>

Hi Everyone,

I've got a question about data representation. I have some psychometric 
data with 5 scores for 15 different groups. I've been asked to show 
some kind of mean plots. The data below is the mean and SD for a given 
group, unfortunately my employer doesn't want me posting full datasets. 
:(

 The groups V,W,X,Y,Z are divided into Bottom, (B), Middle (M) and Top 
(T). An example of my data is shown below.

Score 1
Mean				             SD
	B	    M	    T		    B	  M	    T
V	86.9	13.0	88.8		16.9  2.0	10.5
W	16.1	96.1	17.7		2.2	  4.6	1.7
X	50.7	61.1	74.7		4.7	  3.7	7.6
Y	68.5	99.7	37.6		6.0	  8.0	2.3
Z	92.7	22.3	69.4		6.5	  1.2	2.2

What I did before was a standard mean plot:

plotMeans(w$score1, w$Factor, 
error.bars="sd",xlab="Factor",ylab="Score",main="Group W Score 1 Plot")

 However, with 15 groups and 5 scores this turns into 75 individual 
graphs. Is there a way to layer mean plots? Or show several mean plots 
in the Same graph? Any ideas or suggestions would be great.

thanks,

-Max

How about a lattice plot using panels ? plot the distribution of each score 
(box and whisker style), using a panel for each group?

a <- rnorm(100)
b <- rnorm(100)
c <- rnorm(100)
 d <- rnorm(100)

library(lattice)
new <- make.groups(a,b,c,d

new$grp <- rep(gl(5,20, labels=c('A','B','C','D','E')), 4)

bwplot(data ~ which | grp, data=new)

Not quite means, but close!

And

demo("intervals", package = "lattice")

shows you how to incorporate confidence intervals.

Message-ID: <4769C9B3020000B200035DF1@smtp-a.lshtm.ac.uk>

Dear all,

I'm trying to estimate the parameters of a special case of a poisson
model, where the specified equation has an integral and several fixed
parameters.
I think that the MLE command in STATS4 package could be a good choice,
but it's a little complicated. I've got some problems with the offset
and I don't understand some of the functions. Do you know where can I
find some explicit tutorial about a poisson regression with MLE or,
maybe better, about maximum likelyhood estimation?

Best wishes

Perhaps as long as you're learning a new plotting system, you might also 
check out whether ggplot2 might be an option.

I did a quick and dirty version (which I'm sure Hadley can improve and 
also remind me how to get rid of the legend that shows the "3" that I 
set the size to).

Assuming your data is re-shaped, so it comes out something like mine in 
the artificial example below, then it's a two-liner in ggplot:


maxdat.df <- data.frame (
    score1 =  rnorm(9, mean = rep(c(10,20,30), each = 3), sd = 1 ) ,
    SD = runif(9) * 2 + .5,
    Group = factor ( rep ( c("V", "W", "X"), each = 3 ) ),
    subGroup = rep( c("B","M","T"), 3) )

Won't it be simpler to do:

for (i in 1:12){
data <- my.fun(my.list[i]))   
save(data,file = paste("data",i,".RData", sep="")) }

Hi Max,
This may get a bit crowded, but brkdn.plot (plotrix) will do something 
like this. I think you would want your group variable as the "groups" 
argument (!) and the variable that specifies Bottom/Middle/Top as the 
"obs" argument. Pass "sd" as the "md" argument to get standard deviation 
bars.

Subject: [R] factor manipulation: edgelist to a matrix?
Message-ID: <59796.75.128.40.165.1198135995.squirrel@webmail.uci.edu>

Hello All,

I have had considerable bad luck with attempting the following with for
loops. Here is the problem:


#	Suppose we have a data.frame with the following data, which can be
considered a type of edgelist (for those with networks backgrounds):
#
#       V1	V2
#	1	A
#	1	A
#	1	B
#	2	A
#	3	C
#	3	A
#	3	C
#	3	B
#
#	I want the output of the function to produce a matrix, such that #each
factor of V1 is a row, and each corresponding value at position k of V2 is
the i,j^th element of the new matrix, with missing values otherwise. The
desired output should be:
#	[,1]	[,2]	[,3]	[,4]
# [1,]	A	A	B	NA
# [2,]	A	NA	NA	NA
# [3,]	C	A	C	B

I have explored the reshape package as well as the network package in this
pursuit, with no luck.

Thanks,

I have plenty of those tables, but I think quite a few of them have zero 
marginals (the case I posted might be a bit extreme). I have 400 observations, 
so no matter how centered the distributions are, some observations will be out 
of the center.

The results I got in 2005 cannot be reproduced now in 2007 with the same code; 
I guess this could be due to this bug you describe (maybe it was introduced 
later?). In 2007, I got many correlations has high as the one I described and I 
was wondering what the problem was. I don't have SAS available anymore so I 
cannot run the code I wrote in SAS to compare.

Where can I get the new code for polychor?

I'm in a predicament here; the data I'm analyzing are from a flight simulation 
and are extremely expensive to get, so running more experiments is out of 
question.

Any pointers as to how I could analyze this dataset? (i.e. one where there 
might be zero marginals?)

Thanks

-Jose

one way is the following:

V2 <- LETTERS[c(1,1,2,1,3,1,3,2)]

tab <- table(V1, ave(V1, V1, FUN = seq_along))
vals <- as.vector(t(tab))
vals[vals != 0] <- unlist(split(V2, V1))
vals[vals == 0] <- NA
matrix(vals, nrow(tab), ncol(tab), TRUE)


I hope it helps.

try() is the simple way: see ?try for some basic details.
See also ?tryCatch

Example:

  if(class(temp<-try(log("a")))=="try-error"){
    print("Goodbye")
  } else {print("Hello:");print(temp)}
##Error in log(x) : Non-numeric argument to mathematical function
##[1] "Goodbye"

  if(class(temp<-try(log(10)))=="try-error"){
    print("Goodbye")
  } else {print("Hello:");print(temp)}
##[1] "Hello:"
##[1] 2.302585

Hoping this helps,
Ted.

Message-ID: <476A43FD.8090801@cbs.mpg.de>

Hello, i only got a small problem.

i try to create automatic new dataframes, or png?s. the main problem i
got is:

how can i create automatic a new name for a file (read out by simply
"for") -
i tried to use "(paste...) but theres an errormessage, about a wrong
declination. R told it is as.character, but need as.Real.

Should i use another method than "paste"?

i tried as this:
png("User-", paste(subject, ".png", sep = " "))

^^ as png file, example: User-DA5T.png  <- but if i create one, they are
empty.

Would anybody help me please?

thx Daniel

Subject: [R] Computing normal conf.intervals
Message-ID: <fd3c7adf0712200309w69c1ed29p26e695ca8f81e1a6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

I wonder if there is a built-in function similar to Matlab's "normfit"
which computes 95% CI based on the normality assumption.
So, I have a vector of values and I want to calculate 95% normal CI.
Of course, I could write my own function, no problem, but I still
wonder if built-in functionality exists. (I wish quantile() had this
functionality included).
Anyone knows?

Also, I wonder if there is a function similar to Matlab's "flipud".
Obviously there is package "matlab" which has this function, but I
wonder if I can turn a matrix upside-down without loading matlab
package.

Thanks for your help in advance!

Best,
JM

Thank you very much for your reply. I found the information on your home 
page very useful.

What I want to do is a PLS regression of a data set with 60 features for 
calibration purposes. 
In order to optimize the performance of the calibration I have to find 
out what features to use
in the PLS regression. Although this is what PLS-regression does but I 
found some articles
(R. Leardi, "Genetic algorithms applied to feature selection in PLS 
regression: how and when
to use them", Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems 41 (1998) 
195-207) that claim
that a genetic optimization algorithm applied to feature selection 
could  further improve the calibration.
I found Python code that does exactly this but although I'm much more 
experienced in programming
in Python I think it's probably better to use R for this task. So I'm 
going to implement the genetic
algorithm described in the papers by Leardi in R.

Regards

Rolf

First, be more clear about what the intention is. Prediction intervals,
or confidence intervals for the mean? If the former, do you want the
crude version (plus/minus 1.96s) or the version that takes the
estimation variance into account

As I said, there's no basis for estimating polychoric correlations and all
thresholds when there are zero marginals. If there is more than one row and
column remaining with nonzero marginals, then you could simply eliminate the
rows/columns with zero marginals, but tables with only one nonzero row or
column have no information about the correlation. I'll think about doing
this -- i.e., removing zero rows and columns -- automatically and issuing a
warning.

No program, not even SAS, can magically estimate a correlation from a table
with one row or column. If polychor() did that in 2005, the answer it
provided was erroneous.

I plan to upload a new version of the polycor package to CRAN as soon as I
have a chance -- probably sometime this week. But you already have the code
for polychor() and can modify it yourself: Just fix the test so that it
checks for < 2 rather than < 1 row, and return NA (and issue a warning) in
this case.

I'm sorry, but as I said there's no magic solution here. The data, however
expensive, don't have information relevant to estimating the correlation.

 John

Dear Ajay,

At present, unfortunately, we have so mechanism for distributing code
associated with R News articles. We're considering changes to the
infrastructure that supports R News, including providing the kind of
facility that you suggest. I'm afraid that the best that I can suggest for
now is copying, pasting, and editing the code directly from the PDF file.

Sorry,
 John

Subject: [R] Multicore computation in Windows network: How to set up Rmpi
Message-ID: <476A7427.8060702@helsinki.fi>

R-users,

My question is related to earlier posts about benefits of quadcore over
dualcore computers; I am trying to setup a cluster of windows xp
computers so that eventually I could make use of 10-20 cpu:s, but for
learning how to do this, I am playing around with two laptops.

I thought that the package snow would come handy in this situation, but
to use snow, I would probably need to install package Rmpi first. I
might also like to use Rmpi directly.

In order to use Rmpi in windows, I need to install MPI middle-ware, for
which I have found two options:

MPICH2: http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/

DeinoMPI: http://mpi.deino.net/

First I tried MPICH2 1.06 + R-2.6.0 + Rmpi 0.5-5. (I downloaded windows
binaries of Rmpi from Rmpi website
:http://www.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/yu/Rmpi/)

With MPICH2 I managed to connect my computers so that I was able to
remotely launch Rgui on both machines but R hanged when calling
"library(Rmpi)". If only one Rgui was launched on the localhost,
"library(Rmpi)" worked without errors, but trying to use
"mpi.spawn.Rslaves()" resulted in an error message, and so did
"mpi.universe.size()". (In my current setup I can not reproduce this 
error message, but I can go back to this setup if this seems to be an 
important piece of information)

After that I removed MPICH2 from the system and installed DeinoMPI
instead, thus my setup was DeinoMPI 1.1.0 + R-2.6.0 + Rmpi 0.5-6.
Using this setup on a single machine seems to work,
"mpi.universe.size()" returns the correct number of cpu cores and
"mpi.spawn.Rslaves()" creates one master and one slave on the local 
unicore computer. However, trying to use two computers results in 
similar behavior as with MPICH2: Rgui gets started on both, but R hangs 
when trying "library(Rmpi)".

Following the advice given at the Rmpi website, this behavior could be
due to firewall settings. However, the result is the same if I take down
all my firewalls. Trying to debug this, I tried to run the example MPI
programs provided with the DeinoMPI installation. The example programs
work as expected: both machines participate to parallel computation and
the result is shown on the master node. This makes me believe that the
problem is likely related to R and Rmpi configuration, or the settings
I used when launching Rgui using mpiexec:

Settings on Mpiexec- tab:
Application: "C:\Program Files\R\R-2.6.0\bin\Rgui.exe"
Number of processes: 2
hosts: "akva26 samu" These are the computers with DeinoMPI installed.
DeinoMPI cluster-tab shows that they are ready to accept MPI jobs.)
localroot: checked

Other options were just empty.

I am sure that someone has tried these before, and I was hoping to find 
such users from this mailing list. Could you kindly share your 
experiences about this issue?

For example, does anyone have a working setup with DeinoMPI? According 
to Rmpi website DeinoMPI is the easiest way to set up MPI for a single 
windows machine, but I am not sure whether this is also intended to mean 
that one can not expect it to work with multiple computers.

Regards,

Samu M?ntyniemi

When using the wireframe function you need to create a 2D grid for your two X
variables.  Try the "expand.grid" function on your data, then run the
wireframe on that result

Subject: [R] data shape
Message-ID: <20071220140634.F1689FACA21@as220.org>


Hello:

I have been give a spreadsheet to work with formed as one big table.
What it consists of is a 10-row-by-40-column table for each of about 70
different locations.  In other words, the table row names are repeated
70 times, once for each of the locations (whose names also appear in the
same column, where it's talking about the totals for that location), e.g.:
            A    B    C
 Location1 15   73  123   <-  this row is the sum of the following 3
 Under 10   6   42   23
 10 - 25    4   15   23
 Over 25    5   16   77
 Location2 18   75  113   <- same here
 Under 10   7   45   13
 10 - 25    5   18   44
 Over 25    6   12   56

I want to get this into R as a collection of data frames, one for each
of my locations.  My questions:

  1. There is a way to handle a collection of data frames, isn't there?
     No doubt there are plenty, but what's the easiest way, so that I
     can address them collectively, allowing me to ask such questions as
     what's the max of the over 25's in column C?

  2. What's the easiest way to read such a data array from a text file?
     I can do some editing of a csv file produced from the spreadsheet,
     but don't really know what to aim for.

  3. Is there some shortcut that would allow me to read this directly
     from a spreadsheet?

Many thanks,

 -tom

Instead of looking at ?plot, try:

I think if you use Gabor's suggested addtion of
add.missing to the original cast command you get what
you want.

cast(dfm, ... ~ Var3, add.missing=TRUE)

The log-likelihood for a linear mixed model is well-defined.  Whether
this makes AIC valid or not depends on how comfortable you are with
the idea of AIC in the first place.  My impression is that the
justification for AIC is not entirely rigorous but I must admit that I
haven't gone back to look at the original literature on it.

To the best of my knowledge and ability the log-likelihood from a
model fit by lmer with method = "ML" is properly defined and
accurately evaluated.  (The default estimation criterion in lmer is
REML and models fit by REML provide a close approximation to the
log-likelihood but not an exact result.  If you really want a
log-likelihood and AIC value you should refit with method = "ML".)
What is later done to the log-likelihood to obtain the AIC value is
more problematic.  In particular, one needs to provide a value for the
number of parameters in the model and that can be tricky.  Recently I
was working with models for data on test scores by students over time.
 There were over 200,000 students.  Under one way of counting
parameters, if I incorporate a random effect for the student this
costs me only 1 parameter, corresponding to the variance component for
that random effect.  However, I am incorporating over 200,000 random
effects to help model the observed responses.  So is the number of
parameters 1 or over 200,000?  I don't know.

Regarding the fact the the extractAIC help page doesn't mention models
with random effects, it can't list all the possible methods because
any package can add methods to a generic function.

You may be haning Ion coerced into a factor.  Have a
look at
http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/R/Rhelp02a/archive/98260.html
for some discussion of this. 

I find that I usually set 
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)  just because of
this but as Gabor points out it may have its own
disadvantages in sharing code.  I spent 2 hours once
trying to get an example to work only to find that the
code assume options(stringsAsFactors = TRUE).

Subject: [R] creating a factor from dates by subject?
Message-ID: <877ij9tm8e.fsf@lumen.indyrad.iupui.edu>

Dear R-help,

I have a data set consisting of measurements made on multiple
subjects.  Measurement sessions are repeated for each subject on
multiple dates.  Not all subjects have the same number of
sessions.  To create a factor that represents the session, I do
the following:

data <- read.csv('test-data.csv') # data appended below
data$date <- as.Date(data$date, format='%m/%d/%Y')
data$session <- rep(NA,nrow(data))
for (i in unique(data$ID)) {
  data$session[data$ID==i] <- as.numeric(factor(data$date[data$ID==i]))
}
data$session <- factor(data$session)

This results in a session column in the data frame that runs from
1 to the number of sessions for each subject ID. 

What do you R gurus think of this?  Is there a better more R-ish
way to do this with without creating the session variable in the
data frame and then looping?  I find myself doing this sort of
thing all the time and it feels crufty to me.  

Thanks, Mike

Subject: [R]  alternate storage options
Message-ID: <14438736.post@talk.nabble.com>


useR's.

I am working with an algorithm in which I will need to create combinations
of all the points I have in a matrix.  When I have 2 variables, I simply use
expand.grid() to do this.  Sometimes I am faced with 3 or more variables and
if I run expand.grid(), R cannot process it due to the huge size.  Is there
any efficient way to workaround this? 

Thanks,
Derek

your description is pretty vague, at least for me...

it would be very helpful to have the "commented, minimal, self- 
contained, reproducible code"...

but, anyways, you might want to take a look at the try() command.

Subject: [R] test for factor effect with nested glm
Message-ID: <476A8FB3.6050206@rennes.inra.fr>

Dear all,

I use a nested design with lm and glm, with factor2 nested within 
factor1. In order to test for the significance of both factors, I use 
anova tables on the obtained models such as follows:

/> mod1<-lm(A~factor1/factor2)
 > amod1<-anova(mod1, test="F")
Analysis of Variance Table
Response: A
                   Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value    Pr(>F)   
factor1            15  85.99    5.73  3.1332 8.702e-05 ***
factor1:factor2    42 131.75    3.14  1.7145  0.005654 **
Residuals         308 563.52    1.83                      /

and recalculate the Fvalue for factor1 as follows:

/> ffactor1<-(85.99/15)/(131.75/42)
 > fpop
[1] 1.827491
 > 1-pf(ffactor1,15,42)
[1] 0.06285258/

My question is: am I allowed to do the same with an Analysis of Deviance 
table, calculated on a glm model, as done hereafter:

/> mod2<-glm(M~factor1/factor2, family=Gamma(link=identity))
 > amod2<-anova(mod2,test="F")
 > amod2
Analysis of Deviance Table
Model: Gamma, link: identity
Response: M

Thanks in advance for your answer, and sorry if my question doesn't fit

A list is the best way for that. Then you can use things like lapply  
and sapply, as I do towards the end of the script that follows.

Here is the code I used to read your example, which I saved as a  
comma-separated file, with the only addition that I added the name  
"Names" to the first column. You will probably need to adjust  
filename, nlocations and rows.per.location.

filename <- "~/Desktop/rows.txt"
nlocations <- 2
rows.per.location <- 3
data <- read.csv(filename)
data$Names <- gsub("\\s","", data$Names, perl=TRUE)  # Trim off  
whitespace from first column
totals <- data[4*seq_len(nlocations)-3,]             # Pick up the  
rows with the totals
actual.data <- data[-(4*seq_len(nlocations)-3),]     # Pick up the rest
location.names <-  totals[,1]                        # The location  
names are now the first column of totals
data.by.location <- split(actual.data, rep(location.names,  
each=rows.per.location)) # this is the "workhorse"
data.by.location <- lapply(data.by.location, function(x) {
   data.frame(x[,-1], row.names=x[,1])                   # Converting  
each list item to a better form
})
totals2 <- sapply(data.by.location, function(x) sapply(x,sum))
all(totals2 == t(totals[,-1]))   # Should return true if the totals  
add up

Thank you very much.  This is more than I'd hoped for.

Hi,

The problem is probably that my Var4, does not contain number but factor
information, and therefore I think Gabor's suggestion does not work.
The same holds for Hadley's solution with the functions melt/cast, where the
resulting dataframe looks OK, but the dataframe is filled with the number of
times Var3 occurred for a certain Var1 and a certain Var2. It looks more
like:

Var1	Var2	W1	W2	W3	W4
A	Fa	1	1	
A	Si	1		1
B	Si	1		
C	La		1
C	Do				2

While it should be:

Var1	Var2	W1	W2	W3	W4
A	Fa	F1	F3	
A	Si	F2		F4
B	Si	F5		
C	La		F6
C	Do				F7
C	Do				F8

Or even better:

Var1	Var2	W1	W2	W3	W4
A	Fa	F1	F3	
A	Si	F2		F4
B	Si	F5		
C	La		F6
C	Do				F7/F8

If my original df is like
Var1	Var2	Var3	Var4
A	Fa	W1	F1
A	Si	W1	F2
A	Fa	W2	F3
A	Si	W3	F4
B	Si	W1	F5
C	La	W2	F6
C	Do	W4	F7
C	Do	W4	F8

I think if you use Gabor's suggested addtion of
add.missing to the original cast command you get what
you want.

cast(dfm, ... ~ Var3, add.missing=TRUE)

In that case you'll need to specify an aggregation function.  You probably want:

cast(dfm, ... ~ Var3, function(x) paste(x, collapse="/"), add.missing=TRUE)

Take the size = 3 out of the aesthetic mappings, and put it directly
in geom_pointrange(size = 3) - this way you are setting the size to 3
(mm) rather than asking ggplot to map a variable containing only the
value 3 to the size of the points/lines.  It's a subtle but important
distinction, and I need to figure out how to explain it better.

Subject: [R] hierarchical linear models, mixed models and lme
Message-ID: <476AAA35.4080000@sophia.inra.fr>

Dear R-users,

I am trying to analyse the data of the box 10.5 in the Biometry from 
Sokal and Rohlf (2001) using R. This is a three-level nested anova with 
equal sample size : 3 different treatments are compared ; 2 rats (coded 
1 or 2) / treatment are studied ; 3 preparations (coded 1, 2 or 3) / 
rats are available ; 2 readings of the glycogen content  / preparations 
are realised. Treatment is fixed whereas Rats (nested in Treatment)  and 
Prep (nested in Rats) are random effects.

According to a previous discussion found in the R-help archives (January 
2007), I have tried the following formula :
>  box105.lme<-lme(content~treatment, box105.gd, random=~1|rats/prep)
However,  the formula summary(box105.lme) gives wrong estimates for the 
variance components (rats within treatments, prep within rats, readings 
within preps) ! Moreover the numbers of rats and preps are also wrong, 
with respectively 2 and 6 instead of 3*2=6 and 6* 3=18 !

I have also tried the following formula :
>  box105bis.lme<-lme(content~treatment, box105.gd, 
random=~1|treatment/rats/prep
In this case, the variance components as well as the number of rats and 
preps are correct. Nevertheless, I have two new problems : (1) the 
treatment is first treated as a random effects although it is fixed ! 
(2) there is a serious problem of df when treatment is then treated as a 
fixed effect (18 df for the intercept and 0 for the two other treatments !)

What's wrong ? I didn't find such design and data in Pinheiro and Bates 
(2000)

Thanks for your help,

Nicolas

Since your factors are codes as numbers, the first thing I would check if these
are really factors in your data frame. If these are numeric, you will get a
regression and degrees of freedom are totally off. Try

box105.gd$rats = as.factor(box105.gd$rats)
box105.gd$prep = as.factor(box105.gd$prep)

I am sure there will be some differences to Sokal/Rohlf afterwards, but you
should come closer. Please post a complete, self-running examples if you have
more questions.

Subject: [R] Recursive solution with for()
Message-ID: <476AB488.7010105@econinfo.de>

Hello,

i just ran into the following problem: I wanted to recursively solve 
equations of the type x_1[t]=x_1[t+1]+beta*x_2[t], and used a for-loop 
written

for(j in c(1:t-1, recursive=TRUE){
...
}

This didn't work, so i resolved to writing
for(j in c(10,9,...,1){

which worked, but is not terribly efficient. So, what did I do wrong?

Thanks in advance,

Hello,

I am trying to set my environment to streamline the downloading /

Customizing-the-environment), R-FAQ (5.2 How can add-on packages be
installed?), rw-FAQ, and help pages for Sys.setenv {base},

I am looking for something similar to the download.packages destdir
argument on a global environment level, e.g., destdir <- 'C:/Program
Files/_dave/stats/R/library/_download' in Rprofile.site. Any
suggestions?

Also, in a more general context, is there a way of listing all available
(or common, or default, or standard, . . .) environment variables? I
would like to know if there is an existing convention for any arbitrary
process that I may try to do without reinventing the wheel. This same
question could apply to options() other than those included with a
standard installation.

Thanks, DaveT.

Hello,
I have a bug in my data that read.csv doesn't like, but _only_ when  
specifying "na.strings = 'missing'". If I delete the offending Chinese  
characters the problem goes away as well. I'm satisfied that the  
problems with this data file are fixed, but is there anything I can to  
do avoid this in the future (other than avoiding Chinese characters).  
Any ideas as to what is going on here? I've attached the piece of the  
data file I used for the example below.

Best,
Randy

You could create your own function:

download.packages <- function(pkgs, destdir='C:/Program 
Files/_dave/stats/R/library/_download', ...)
   utils::download.packages(pkgs, destdir, ...)

Sys.getenv() will return a list of the ones that are currently defined.

I don't know what you mean about an "arbitrary process".

For options(), you could save the names that you consider standard (e.g. 
by starting an empty session and entering standardoptions <- 
names(options()), then at a later time do

newoptions <- names(options())
newoptions[ !(newoptions %in% standardoptions) ]

There's no easy way to know the options that would mean something in the 
current context but are not currently defined.

What I see is the predictions being less extreme than the
actual values -- predictions for large actual values are smaller
than the actual, and predictions for small actual values are
larger than the actual.  That makes sense to me.  The object
is to maximize out-of-sample predictive power, not in-sample
predictive power.

Or am I missing something in what you are saying?

There are a few different options that you can try depending on your
problem and your preferences:

1.  For large lambda the poisson can be approximated by a normal, for
large n (even for small lambda) the mean is approximately normal due to
the central limit theorem.  So if your lambda and n are large enough in
combination then you could just do a standard 2 sample t-test (t.test
function) and use the approximate p-value from there.

2.  Fit 2 models by maximum likelihood, one in which both lambdas are
equal and one in which they can differ (fitdistr from MASS may help, or
look at optim and friends), then do a likelihood ratio test on the
differences (-2 * likelihood diff is approx chisquared(1) under the
null).

3.  Do a permutation test:  find the difference in the
means/medians/(other stat of interest) between the 2 samples, then
permute the samples randomly (create 2 samples of the same sizes from
the original data values, but with random assignment as to which group a
value goes into) and find the same difference, repeate a bunch of times
(like 1998) and combine all the differences found into a vector, plot
the histogram of the values and look at where the original difference
fits into the distribution.  The number of values that are as or more
extreeme than the original value is your p-value.

4.  Create logical bins for values (e.g. 0-1, 2-3, 4-6, 7+) and count
how many from each group fall in each bin, use prop.test or chisq.test
to see if the proportions differ.

5.  Probably some others that don't come to mind right now.

Hope this helps,

Notice that the panel function has a capital S in its name but not the

produce a more serious problem?

That was about as easy as it would be possible to make it.  Thank you

Hi Livia,

There are several ways to do this.  Try:

a=50/12

floor(a) will give you the entire portion, and

a-floor(a) will give you the remainder.

Have you looked at the SQLiteDF package?  It seems like it would do what
you want in a better way and much simpler.  Even if that does not work
then a database approach (look at the other db packages, probably RODBC
first) could be simpler, faster, and easier.  You may also want to look
at the g.data package for another approach.

Depending on what you are doing you may also want to look at the biglm
package (some similar functionality is in SQLiteDF).

Hope this helps,

Subject: [R] running custom functions in Snow clusters
Message-ID: <003701c8434e$d470c710$0e161981@BIOINFORMATICS2>

When running a function in parallel using for example the clusterCall 
function in Snow is it possible to call other user-written functions from 
each cluster?  I get an error when I try to do this.  I tried to source the 
function on each cluster using the clusterEvalQ function but this doesn't 
seem to work.  This is more of an aesthetic problem than an actual one as 
obviously I can write a group of functions as one function and call this 
with clusterCall.

Thanks,

One possibility is to use the cnvrt.coords function from the
TeachingDemos package.  It shows an example of putting a rectangle
across multiple plots.  You would need to create the 1st (top) plot,
find the coordinate of the top and convert that to device coordinates,
then create the rest of your plots and after making the last (bottom)
one find the user coordinates for the left right and bottom, convert the
coordinate for the top from device to current user coordinates and then
plot the rectangle.

Hope this helps,

The other one I should have mentioned:

5.1:  Use the glm function with family = poisson.  The counts are the y
variable and the x variable is either 0/1 or a 2 level factor indicating
which group the values come from.  The p-value for the slope of x tests
for a difference in the 2 groups.

5.2 if this is just to make someone happy who always wants a p-value,
but doesn't understand it and will never actually use it, then use
runif.

5.3 ...

Hi all,

Does anybody have a magic trick handy to isolate directly consecutive
integers from something like this:
c(1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10,12,13)

The result should be, that groups 1-4, 7-10 and 12-13 are consecutive
integers ...

Thanks for any hints, Joh

Joh,

x <- c(1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10,12,13)
which(diff(x) != 1)

gives the indices of the 'jumps'.

Not fully tested, but here is one possible approach:

> Vec
 [1]  1  2  3  4  7  8  9 10 12 13

Breaks <- c(0, which(diff(Vec) != 1), length(Vec))

[[1]]
[1] 1 2 3 4

[[2]]
[1]  7  8  9 10

[[3]]
[1] 12 13



For a quick test, I tried it on another vector:


set.seed(1)
Vec <- sort(sample(20, 15))

Hi Xin,

You can use the nlsolve() function that I have written to solve a nonlinear
system of equations.  It converts a root finding problem into a minimization
problem, and uses optim() to find the minimizer.  

A well-known problem with this approach to root-finding is that a local
minimum of the squared residual function is not necessarily a root of the
nonlinear system.  A nice feature of nlsolve() is that it will try "really
hard" (by increasing the "nstarts" argument) to find the solution to the
system by identifying multiple local minima of the squared residual
function, if they exist.  

Here is a solution to your problem (I rearranged your equations a bit).

func <- function(x, A, B, pz) {
f <- rep(NA,length(x))
f[1] <- A/(1-pz^10) - x[2]*(1-x[1])/(x[1]*(1-x[1]^x[2]))
f[2] <- A + B/A - 1/x[1] - x[2]*(1-x[1])/x[1] 
f
}

Subject: [R] can optimize solve paired euqations?

I used the command below, but R gives me the error message--syntax error.
can anyone see the mistakes I made?


optimize(function(x,y)
+ ((327.727-(1-0.114^10)*y*(1-x)/x/(1-x^y))+(9517.336-327.727
*(1+(1-x)*(1+y)/x-327.727)))^2
+ interval=c(0,1))


At the same time, I use nlm() but R gives me the code 

$code
[1] 3

function(vals) { 

        x <- vals[1] 

        y <- vals[2] 

 
sum(c((199.458913633542-(1-0.114^10)*y*(1-x)/x/(1-x^y)),(5234.11964684527-19
9.458913633542*(1+(1-x)*(1+y)/x-199.458913633542)))^2)

}

  

nlm(f, c(2,2))







Any one know how to deal with this case?

Thanks

Xin

I see the same message.  Perhaps it has something to do with the HTML in 
your message?  If you can get Hotmail to send plain ascii email, without 
HTML, your messages might make it into the archive.

This is OK if the ratio is positive, but for -50
divided by 12 the floor is -5 and the remainder is 10
(and not -4 and -2 as one may want). By the way, using
%% and %/% leads to same result.
Using trunc will remedy the situation, i.e.

I would expect this regression towards the mean behavior on a new or hold out
dataset, not on the training data. In RF terminology, this means that the
model prediction from predict is the in-bag estimate, but the out-of-bag
estimate is what you want for prediction. In Joshua's example,
rf.rf$predicted is an out-of-bag estimate, but since newdata is given, it
appears that the result is the in-bag estimate, which still needs an
adjustment like Joshua's  (and perhaps a more complex one might be needed in
some cases). This is a bit confusing since predict() usually matches what's
in model$fitted.values. I imagine that's why the author used "predicted" as
the component name instead of the standard "fitted.values".

The documentation for predict.randomForest explains:

"newdata - a data frame or matrix containing new data. (Note: If not given,
the out-of-bag prediction in object is returned. "

Here is Str(Sheet1)

 $ Claims                     : num  NA 1 2 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
 $ SubmissionStatus           : Factor w/ 4 levels "Bound","Dead",..: 3 1 1
1 1 1 3 2 3 4 ...


I would expect Sheet1$Claimsnum[4] to be 0, since the true condition of the
2nd ifelse evaluations to 0.
Without the "as.character" the results are still not the way I want them:

> Sheet1$Claimsnum <- ifelse(Sheet1$SubmissionStatus != "Bound",99999,

You can use a loop...

If x,y and z are your vectors containing Nx,Ny and Nz
numbers respectively, then
for (Ix in 1:Nx) for (Iy in 1:Ny) for (Iz in 1:Nz) {
Point <- c(x[Ix],y[Iy],z[Iz])
do whatever you need with Point
}

A (probably better) compromise may be:

a <- matrix(0,nrow = Ny*Nz, ncol = 3)
for (i in 1:Nx) {
a[,2:3] <- expand.grid(y,z)
a[,1] <- x[i]
do whatever you want with a
}

To check for NA, use is.na. For instance your second ifelse should read:

ifelse(is.na(Sheet1$Claims),0,Sheet1$Claims))

Converting Sheet1$Claims to character doesn't have the effect you  
think it does. NA is still NA, it does not become "NA". Try for  
instance:

as.character(NA)
as.character(NA) == "NA"

Hi Louis,

You could try this:

# find the index of the maximum value in each row of _data_, #
disregarding the last column classified <-
apply(data[,-(nclass+1)],1,which.max)

## or, if the maximum may be repeated:
classified <- apply(data[,-(nclass+1)], 1, FUN = function(x) which(x ==
max(x)))

# the variable _truth_ is just the last column of _data_ ?
truth <- data[,nclass + 1]

?table
z <- table(classified, truth)

Hi,

I am running the following loop, but it takes hours to run as n is big.
Is there any way "apply" can be used? Thanks.
### Start
    nclass <- dim(data)[[2]] - 1
    z <- matrix(0, ncol = nclass, nrow = nclass)
    n <- dim(data)[[1]]
    x <- c(1:nclass)

        truth <- data[loop, nclass + 1]
        z[classified, truth] <- z[classified, truth] + 1

# loop ends

Off the top, data is a bad choice for your dataframe, as it conflicts
with a standard function. Also, including some actual data would make
this easier to work with. I think you're using dim(data)[[1]] to get
the number of rows of data? That can be more clearly expressed as
nrow(data), and dim(data)[[2]] == ncol(data).

Anyways, this might be helpful:

add.mat <- apply(data[,1:nclass], MAR = 1, FUN = function(x) 
	         ifelse(x == max(x), 1, 0))

for(i in 1:n)
    z[ , data[i, ncol(data)]] <- z[ , data[i, ncol(data)]] + add.mat[,i]

There's still a loop, but it might not be needed depending on what
values 'truth' holds. Most of the calculations are shifted into the
apply() call, so the one line loop should run at least a little faster
than what you started with.

HTH,

Tyler

Subject: [R] NaN as a parameter in NLMINB optimization
Message-ID: <354443.40411198213630658.JavaMail.root@calliope.stern.nyu.edu>

I am trying to optimize a likelihood function using NLMINB.  After running without a problem for quite a few iterations (enough that my intermediate output extends further than I can scroll back), it tries a vector of parameter values NaN.  This has happened with multiple Monte Carlo datasets, and a few different (but very similar) likelihood functions.  (They are complicated, but I can send them to someone if desired.)

Is this something that can happen with NLMINB, perhaps because of a 0/0 in the gradient calculations?  Or is it unique to my code?

Thanks in advance!

Subject: [R] Finding overlaps in vector
Message-ID: <fkfrm5$vj3$1@ger.gmane.org>

<posted & mailed>

Dear all,

I'm trying to solve the problem, of how to find clusters of values in a
vector that are closer than a given value. Illustrated this might look as
follows:

vector <- c(0,0.45,1,2,3,3.25,3.33,3.75,4.1,5,6,6.45,7,7.1,8)

When using '0.5' as the proximity requirement, the following groups would
result:
0,0.45
3,3.25,3.33,3.75,4.1
6,6.45
7,7.1

Jim Holtman proposed a very elegant solution in
http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/e2/help/07/07/21286.html, which I have
modified and perused since he wrote it to me. The beauty of this approach
is that it will not only work for constant proximity requirements as above,
but also for overlap-windows defined in terms of ppm around each value.
Now I have an additional need and have found no way (short of iteratively
step through all the groups returned) to figure out how to do that with
Jim's approach: how to figure out that 6,6.45 and 7,7.1 are separate
clusters?

Thanks for any hints, Joh

I vent back to MPICH2 installation to see what the error was:
"ERROR in names(HOSTNAMES)<-base: attempt to set an attribute on NULL"

Trying to rethink what the problem was I realized that unlike in 
DeinoMPI, I need to write the host names manually on the "configurable 
settings" -window, and in order to have one cpu available on the local 
machine, I need to write "myhostname:2".

After these changes MPICH2 1.06 +R-2.6.0+Rmpi 0.5-5 work on the single 
machine in the same way as my DeinoMPI installation: Correct number of 
cpu:s is detected and I can "mpi.spawn.Rslaves()"

I will try to do this with two hosts next and see if there is more luck 
with MPICH2 than DeinoMPI.

If you do not heve identical dates in one ID then

unlist(lapply(rle(test$V1)$lengths, seq))

shall give you session vector.

perhaps it wouldn't be too much to ask for you to
check the most recent version of the "magic" package?

[and we *really* don't want any whingeing about
magic_1.3-31 not being available.  If I were you, I'd
email the package maintainer and tell him to release
updates in a more timely manner. . . ]

First question: is this the right mailing list to discuss installation

if yes:
(Windows XP professional environment )
Installing a second  packege after the first causes an error:

Subject: [R] Within and Between matrix
Message-ID: <20071221121452.zzppsadwgggoo0s8@icare.u-paris10.fr>

Hi the list...

I am working on cluster analysis, more precisely on Calinski and 
Harabasz criterion
( C(g)=Trace(between)/Trace(Within)*(n-g)/(g-1)) )
Is there a package for calculating within and between matrix?
Morever, when we are using matrix with missing value, how do they 
handle it? On a more theorical point of view, how shall we do? 
Imputation will probably underestimate it, isn't it ?

After running without a problem for quite a few iterations (enough that my intermediate output extends further than I can scroll back), it tries a vector of parameter values NaN.  This has happened with multiple Monte Carlo datasets, and a few different (but very similar) likelihood functions.  (They are complicated, but I can send them to someone if desired.)

I would say it's a bug. I can't tell if it's a bug in your code or in 
the nlminb code, but even if it's a problem with your code, it would be 
nice if nlminb could recognize it and give a error report rather than 
passing garbage to your function.

Can you put together a small enough example to post here?  If not, you 
could send me the full example, but I may not get to it for a couple of 
weeks.  In either case, try to make sure the error occurs on every run 
by using set.seed() and/or a fixed dataset.  If the problem is 
intermittent even with that, please let us know.

Seems ok, but ``only works for increasing sequences''.
More than 12 years ago, I had encountered the same problem and
solved it like this:

In package 'sfsmisc', there has been the function  inv.seq(),
named for "inversion of seq()",
which does this too, currently returning an expression,
but returning a call in the development version of sfsmisc:

Its definition is currently

inv.seq <- function(i) {
  ## Purpose: 'Inverse seq': Return a short expression for the 'index'  `i'
  ## --------------------------------------------------------------------
  ## Arguments: i: vector of (usually increasing) integers.
  ## --------------------------------------------------------------------
  ## Author: Martin Maechler, Date:  3 Oct 95, 18:08
  ## --------------------------------------------------------------------
  ## EXAMPLES: cat(rr <- inv.seq(c(3:12, 20:24, 27, 30:33)),"\n"); eval(rr)
  ##           r2 <- inv.seq(c(20:13, 3:12, -1:-4, 27, 30:31)); eval(r2); r2
  li <- length(i <- as.integer(i))
  if(li == 0) return(expression(NULL))
  else if(li == 1) return(as.expression(i))
  ##-- now have: length(i) >= 2
  di1 <- abs(diff(i)) == 1	#-- those are just simple sequences  n1:n2 !
  s1 <- i[!c(FALSE,di1)] # beginnings
  s2 <- i[!c(di1,FALSE)] # endings

  ## using text & parse {cheap and dirty} :
  mkseq <- function(i,j) if(i == j) i else paste(i,":",j, sep="")
  parse(text =
        paste("c(", paste(mapply(mkseq, s1,s2), collapse = ","), ")", sep = ""),
        srcfile = NULL)[[1]]
}

with example code

 > v <- c(1:10,11,6,5,4,0,1)
 > (iv <- inv.seq(v))
 c(1:11, 6:4, 0:1)
 > stopifnot(identical(eval(iv), as.integer(v)))
 > iv[[2]]
 1:11
 > str(iv)
  language c(1:11, 6:4, 0:1)
 > str(iv[[2]])
  language 1:11
 > 


Now, given that this stems from  1995,  I should be excused for
using   parse(text = *)  [see  fortune(106) if you don't understand].

However, doing this differently by constructing the resulting
language object directly {using substitute(), as.symbol(),
	 		  as.expression() ... etc}
seems not quite trivial.

So here's the Friday afternoon /  Christmas break quizz:  

  What's the most elegant way
  to replace the last statements in  inv.seq()
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ## using text & parse {cheap and dirty} :
  mkseq <- function(i,j) if(i == j) i else paste(i,":",j, sep="")
  parse(text =
        paste("c(", paste(mapply(mkseq, s1,s2), collapse = ","), ")", sep = ""),
	      srcfile = NULL)[[1]]
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  by code that does not use parse (or source() or similar) ???

I don't have an answer yet, at least not at all an elegant one.
And maybe, the solution to the quiz is that there is no elegant
solution.

Subject: [R] post hoc in repeated measures of anova
Message-ID: <20071221143043.xe5msd8ic8wo00cc@webmail.uni-konstanz.de>

Hallo, I have this dataset with repeated measures. There are two  
within-subject factors, "formant" (2 levels: 1 and 2) and "f2 Ref" (25  
levels: 670, 729, 788, 846, 905, 1080, 1100, 1120, 1140, 1170, 1480,  
1470, 1450, 1440, 1430, 1890, 1840, 1790, 1740, 1690, 2290, 2210,  
2120, 2040, 1950), and one between-subject factor, lang (2 levels:1  
and 2). The response variable is "thresh".

I ran a three-way ANOVA with repeated measures:

vThresh<-read.table("rRes.csv",header=T,sep=",")
attach(vThresh)
vThresh.aov<-aov(thresh~factor(lang)*factor(formant)*factor(f2Ref)+Error(factor(sub)))
summary(vThresh.aov)
detach(vThresh)

The table looks like this:

Error: factor(sub)
              Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value  Pr(>F)
factor(lang)  1  442.6   442.6  4.8849 0.03112 *

Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1


Most of the main effects and interactions are significant, so I would  
like to do post hoc comparison for all main effects and interactins.
I have been trying hard to figure out how to do, but I am sorry, I am  
still novice and could not find the way to do.

It will be great if you could help me with codes for post hoc in  
repeated measures ANOVA.

Here is the dataset:

Subject: [R]  Plotting multiple jpegs on a plot?
Message-ID: <14456941.post@talk.nabble.com>


Hello,

I have a set of data which I currently represent graphically on a plot. To
do that, I use the embedded functions from the graphics package (symbols,
rect, etc.) However, I would like to use static jpeg images to represent the
data if possible. Here's my progress so far:

1. Used the rimage library to obtain the read.jpeg func. 
2. Read in my jpeg image and assigned it to a variable.
3. I can plot the image itself if i just do plot(image). However, I have no
idea on how to plot a lot of images at the same time.
4. I've tried the subplot func, but it says that my margins are too small
(My jpeg is 40x40 rgb). The maximum margin that I've been able to create was
20. However, this does not help the cause, because I want to add images to
the plot itself, instead to the plot's margins.

Has someone wrestled this one before? If yes, can you please explain how?

Thanks!

Good morning, Dear Lister,
I really like to use R on our unix server. However, I am not an admin
of the system.
I am wondering if it is possible to install R on unix without admin previlege.

Thank you so much! Have a nice Xmas season!

Hi,

I don't think you have given enough information for
anyone to offer advice. 

A small working (or almost working ) exmple that
reproduces the problem would help.

Well i don't know which Unix you have, but it shouldn't matter anyway.
If you're able to compile programs on the machine then download
the R source, compile it and install it into your local directory.

Hello all:

I'm sorry to take up bandwidth with easy questions, but as an R
beginner, I continue to be surprised by factors.  If someone can shed
some light for me, I'd be grateful:

> d
 Total z02801 z02802 z02804 z02806 z02807 z02808 z02809 z02812 z02813

507 Levels: 0 10 1001 1004 1008 1016 1027 1028 103 1031 10318 1043 1045 ... Na

z02807 z02812 z02809 z02804 z02806 z02801 z02813 z02802  Total z02808 
   103    112   1328    169   2368     29    501     51  54813     76

Apparently this factor is sorted in alphabetic order, not numeric order.
I find no parameter of sort() that controls for this.

And yet: 

> mode(d)
[1] "numeric"
> length(d)
[1] 10

I would have thought that because d is a numeric list of ten values, I'd
get them sorted in numeric order.

Can someone help me understand why this is expected behavior, and also
what I should do in order to see the numerically sorted list of values I
really want?

Many thanks,

 -tom

HI, Gabor,
what program do i need to compile R on unix?
local dir? do you mean dir under my user name with my profile?

The source code for both Fortran routines is in the package.  If I recal 
correctly the book by Hastie & Tibshirani has descriptions of 
the algorithms they used.

By default, factors are characters and sorted in alphabetical order.
It looks like somehow you numeric data was converted to factors.
Therefore '10' comes before '2'.  If you want the factors in numeric
order you have to convert them back.  Look in the FAQs.

Creating a local copy of the function with alternate argument defaults
works perfectly. I have done that in the past, don't know why I didn't
think of it this time. Thank you.

Saving initial- and post-session options (or their names) also nicely
addresses part of my concern. Thank you.

I am familiar with Sys.getenv() and was asking about potential
environment variables that are NOT currently defined. However, while
trying to rephrase my question, having reread the Startup {base} help
and related documentation, could not clearly refine the issue in my own
mind so, I am now content with the situation.

I think that I may be confusing the intended use of environment files
and profile files as noted in the details section of the Startup {base}
documentation. Part of my concern is to find a way of safeguarding
against my own errors and typos that may 'break the system' or having
something installed later (the "arbitrary process" part) breaking my
current setup. Also, I may be thinking of the startup process as
something 'different' from the interactive R session processing, which I
am beginning to see it is not.

Thanks again, DaveT.

This may not be as direct as Jim's in terms of specifying granularity but
will uses conventional hierarchical clustering to create the clusters and also
draws a nice dendrogram for you.   I have split the dendrogram at a
height of 0.5
to define the clusters but you can change that to whatever granularity you like:

At least a C compiler, maybe a Fortran compiler too.
Some standard Unix tools like make as well. See also:
http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html

I mean any directory you've write access to, on a disk where you've 
enough space to install R.

Subject: [R] R script to start session (without automatically finishing)
Message-ID: <476BF040.609@hhi.fraunhofer.de>

Hello R friends

I am quite impressed by the power of R, I am using it only since some 
weeks now. But its visualizing capabilities are outstanding!

But one thing I couldn't solve: I have programs producing lots of data, 
most times 3D. In R I am using the library rgl to visualize nicely the 
3D data.

What I would like to do is to write R scipts which read in a data file 
and show me the 3D rgl plot. So that on the command line I just call my 
newly written R script, which pops up the rgl window. This session 
should run until I close the rgl window or press a button or something 
like this.

Currently, I can write R scripts
- using Rscript or
- http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/help/04/05/0500.html
But both approaches contain the problem that the rgl window pops up for 
just a moment, and then the program terminates.


Does any body has an idea, what to do? Help would be very appreciated.

Thank's a lot and ... Marry Christmas + Happy New Year

Philipp

So you have to write a script that will not terminate until you 'press a 
button or something like this'.  That's easy to do, but as you haven't 
told us your OS.  E.g. on Windows, call winDialogString at the end.

Thanks Deepayan, this helped a lot and gave me exactly what I wanted
however I want a few changes and am not sure how to do them.  In each
panel the bars for the years are the same color with the bottom axis
(the x-axis) labelled with the years.  I would like each year to have a
specific color with a legend for it at the side, is this possible?
And my other question is that there seems to be a gap between where the
bars start and the x-axis, it is kinda funny looking so is there anyway
to change this?
Thanks for all the help

I would suggest a slightly different format. Here's an example with one
set of limits; you can add another set similarly. If you really want a
single panel, you could use panel.segments().

barchart(percent_below ~ factor(Year) | factor(season,
levels=unique(season)),
         data= dataset1, origin = 0, layout = c(4, 1),
         upper_2007 = c(6, 4, 5, 3),
         panel = function(..., upper_2007) {
             panel.abline(h = upper_2007[packet.number()])
             panel.barchart(...)
         })

Sure, just use Year as a grouping variable as well.

barchart(percent_below ~ factor(Year) | factor(season, levels=unique(season)),
         data = dataset1, layout = c(4, 1),
         groups = factor(Year),

What exactly do you want to happen? I don't think a bar chart is an
appropriate visualization unless the lengths of the bars mean
something. If it does, and you just want to get rid of the space below
zero, the easiest way is to set an explicit ylim=c(0, 7) or something.
If the lengths don't really mean anything, you should consider using
dotplot() instead.

Dear All,

 

I have a numerical problem:

R, as other statistical software, can tell the difference between very small numbers and 0, while apparently cannot distinguish a number close to 1 and 1. In the example below, is it possible to instruct R to recognize that q is different from 1?

> p=.00000000000000000000000000000001

> p==0

[1] FALSE

> q=.99999999999999999999999999999

> q==1

[1] TRUE

Interestingly, 

> (1-p)==1

[1] TRUE

The main problem I have is that I need to evaluate the inverse of the normal Cumulative Distribution Function near 1 (but not exactly 1) and the PC cannot recognize it.

Thank you very much for your help!

No, the limitations are inherent in the floating point representation 
that R uses.

In this particular case, it's easy:  make use of the symmetry of the 
distribution.  If you want the 1-epsilon quantile of a normal with mean 
mu, find the epsilon quantile, and reflect it through mu:

mu <- 3
-qnorm(1e-30, mean=-mu)

More generally, you can make use of the log.p argument to the quantile 
functions, and the fact that log(1-epsilon) is close to -epsilon:

qnorm(-1e-30, mean=mu, log.p=TRUE)

Thank you very much for this elegant solution to the problem. The reason I
still hope for an extension of Jim's code (not the one re responded with in
this thread, but the one I actually reference) is that windows of overlap
can be asymetric with that: one can check e.g. whether values overlap given
the constraints that the closest allowed proximity 'down' is 0.5 and 'up'
is 0.75. I would highly cherish a solution that would allow for cluster
isolation with that requirement.

Thanks for your time and insight,

Joh

Jim,

Although I can't find the post this code stems from, I had come across it on
my prowling the NG. It's not the one you had shared with me to eliminate
overlaps (and which I referenced below:
http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/e2/help/07/07/21286.html). That
particular solution you had come up with marked entries as overlapping or
not, and I am looking for an extension to that code which would also return
the actual "clusters" of consecutively overlapping values. While Gabor's
code in this thread does what I require for the example I still hope
somebody more cluefull than myself can extent your code since it carries
the - for me - significant advantage of being able to build the windows of
overlap with different values for 'up' and 'down', let's say check which
values overlap when the overlap-defining distance is 5ppm 'up' and
7.5ppm 'down' from each value. This is a generalization I would highly
cherish.

Thanks for your help and continuous patience on r-help.

Hm, hm, rect.hclust doesn't accept "plot=FALSE" and cutree doesn't retain
the indexes of membership ... anyway short of ripping out the guts of
rect.hclust to achieve the same result without an active graphics device?

Answering my own query here's a solution (if any reader was curious):

forestplot=function(mean,std,conf,threshold){
z=-qnorm((1-conf)/2)
CI.H <- mean+z*sqrt(std) # Calculate upper CI 
CI.L <- mean-z*sqrt(std) # Calculate lower CI 
plot(mean,1:length(mean),xlim=c(min(CI.L),max(CI.H)),pch=15,cex=1,
ylab="",xlab="mean & CIs",main="Forest plot")
arrows(mean,1:length(mean),CI.H,1:length(mean), angle=90,length=0.05)
arrows(mean,1:length(mean),CI.L,1:length(mean), angle=90,length=0.05)
abline(v=threshold,lty=3)
}

Hi, everyone

I wonder if there is a function in R with which I can create a square
matrix with elements off main diagonal (for example one diagonal below
the main diagonal).

Thanks in advance!

First, I suggest that you avoid attach(), and convert the numbers to factors 
in the data frame. The formula and the results are much easier to read, and 
the risk of making some mistake is reduced. lm and lme will work perfectly 
without factor(), but the results can be misleading or simply wrong, because 
numbers are treated as what one used to call continuous covariables in the 
old days (still persisting in psychology departments).

vThresh$formant = as.factor(vThresh$formant)

... same for the other factors. Better even, give you factors nice names 
(ok, with formants, numbers _are_ a natural order).

Then, use lm, which gives you a basic set of contrasts. Make sure that 
you understand that (Intercept) stands for the base level of all factors 
(e.g. 1), and the others are roughly differences, or differences of 
differences (interactions).

vThresh.lm = lm(thresh~lang*formant*f2Ref+Error(factor(sub),data=vThresh)

or, even better, use lme instead of lm when you have repeated measurements:

library(nlme)
vThresh.lme = lme(thresh~lang*formant*f2Ref, data=vThresh, random=~1|subject)

You can use stepAIC from MASS to prune down your model to relevant terms.

Then, use estimable in package gmodels, or glht in package multcomp to 
compute the post-hoc tests. 

Getting the contrasts right can be tricky; I use an Excel Spreadsheet to
construct the contrast with a bit of conditional formatting (0 white, yellow 
1) to easier spot errors, and read the named contrast ranges via ODBC.

Dieter

# some auxillary function to construct contrast in Excel and have the
# variable nicely named in estimable

"readContrasts" = 
function(cname,excelfile) {
  require(gdata)
  require(RODBC) # for trim
  channel=odbcConnectExcel(excelfile)
  cn=sqlQuery(channel,paste("select * from",cname),as.is=TRUE)
  odbcClose(channel)
  if (class(cn) != "data.frame") stop(cn[[2]],call.=FALSE)
  cn[,1] = trim(cn[,1]) # trim in gdata
  cn
}

"getContrasts" = 
function(cname,excelfile,rows=NULL) {
  cn=readContrasts(cname,excelfile)
  if (!is.null(rows)) cn = cn[rows,]
  colnames= cn[,1]
  rownames = gsub('#','.',colnames(cn))#[-1]
  # Use _ as placeholder for an empty field
  vars = do.call("rbind", strsplit(rownames,'\\.'))
  vars[vars=='_'] = ''
  # upper left corner must contain the names of the variables
  varnames = vars[1,]
  vars = vars[-1,,drop=FALSE]
  rownames(vars)=rownames[-1]
  colnames(vars)=varnames
  cn = t(as.matrix(cn[,-1]))
  rownames(cn) = rownames[-1]
  colnames(cn) = colnames
  attr(cn,"vars") = data.frame(vars)
  cn
}

You could combine rbind, diag and cbind:
rbind(rep(0,3),cbind(diag(2),rep(0,2)))
rbind(rep(0,4),cbind(diag(3),rep(0,3)))
.......

A simple function:

belowDiagonal = function(x)
{
    diagBelow=rbind(rep(0,length(x)+1),cbind(diag(x),rep(0,length(x))))
    return(diagBelow)
}


belowDiagonal(7)
belowDiagonal(1:5)

Dear UseRs,

the new Task View "ExperimentalDesign" (Title: Design of Experiments (DoE) &
Analysis of Experimental Data) has just been uploaded to CRAN. It covers
packages that have functionalities for designing experiments or specific tools
for analyzing data from designed experiments. I hope that it will be useful
and will become more useful over time with a growing range of functionality in
R in this area.

Use the lower.tail= argument to qnorm (or just use the fact that the

Subject: [R] RMySQL installation
Message-ID: <29BC2192-BEFE-4567-A639-79D2DF2B2690@fhcrc.org>

Hi,

I am having trouble getting RMySQL running on a solaris machine.
[43] bedrock:/home/jayoung/source_codes/R/other_packages> uname -a
SunOS bedrock 5.10 Generic_118833-36 sun4v sparc SUNW,Sun-Fire-T200

I thought I had finally managed to get it installed, albeit with some  
warnings that I didn't understand (it took me a while to find where  
our mysql libraries were), but when I tried to load it within R I got  
an error:

 > library(RMySQL)
Error in dyn.load(file, ...) :
   unable to load shared library '/home/btrask/traskdata/lib/R/ 
library/RMySQL/libs/RMySQL.so':
   ld.so.1: R: fatal: relocation error: file /home/btrask/traskdata/ 
lib/R/library/RMySQL/libs/RMySQL.so: symbol mysql_more_results:  
referenced symbol not found
Error: package/namespace load failed for 'RMySQL'


I'm not a sysadmin and don't know any C, so I don't really understand  
this error, but I'm wondering whether we might have an older,  
incompatible version of mysql?
[42] bedrock:/home/jayoung/source_codes/R/other_packages> mysql -V
mysql  Ver 12.22 Distrib 4.0.24, for sun-solaris2.10 (sparc)

Or am I somehow failing to specify some of the necessary libraries in  
LD_LIBRARY_PATH or some other thing R is using to look for libraries?

I've pasted the command I used for installation, and the output of  
the build process below, as well as the output of sessionInfo.

Thanks in advance for any help,

Janet Young

If we don't need any plotting we don't really need rect.hclust at
all.  Split the output of cutree, instead.  Continuing from the
prior code:

Subject: [R] Apparent discordant solution using NLS() vs Optim or Excel for
	IWLS problem
In-Reply-To: <548b8d440709051643p69659404ude641b631b9eb25c@mail.gmail.com>
Message-ID: <22544730.1198283777869.JavaMail.root@wombat.diezmil.com>

I am writing a program for automated (i.e. no user intervention - for biologists) iteratively reweighted least-square fit to a function of the form "reading ~ exp(lm2)/(1 + (dose/exp(lm3))^exp(lm4)" using case weight proportional to the mean, e.g., E(reading).    Because for some datasets the solution is sensitive to starting values, I first use OPTIM() with Nelder-Mead to locate the solution, and then plug the solution into NLS() (default algorithm) using the appropriate weights as a way to retrieve SEs, deviance, etc rather than computing these from OPTIM results.

The problem I have discovered is the following.  OPTIM()  arrives at the correct solution that minimizes the objective function, and I have confirmed this in numerous examples in Excel.  When this solution is plugged into NLS(), the first evaluation yields the same value of the objective function as OPTIM().  NLS() then attempts steps, and apparently finds a slightly different solution with a smaller value for the objective function.  However, this new solution actually does not give a smaller objective function value, but rather a larger one, when verifed against an independent computation.  Hence, it appears that NLS is getting confused and taking a step based on erroneous computation of the objective function.  

An example is below, with an abridged OPTIM output followed by NLS output:

-- ************** START OUTPUT **************************
-- [1] "Drug = Melphelan"
-- [1] "Cell line = CHLA-266"
--   Nelder-Mead direct search function minimizer

-- Stepsize computed as 1.801225

[***NOTE - the correct solution parameters values are the line above on the absolute scale, which are the values below on the ln scale, representing the first evaluation by NLS.  This gives the correct objective function value of 0.763370, and hence agrees with OPTIM at this point ***]

Can anyone suggest what I might be doing wrong, or is this a bug or anomaly of the NLS algorithm?

Thanks in advance

Evaluate it at 1, evaluate the density at 1, and use basic calculus to 
calculate the differential of the cumulative distribution for small 
differentials away from 1.

The trackObjs package is designed to make it easy to work in approximately 
this manner -- it saves objects automatically to disk but they are still 
accessible as normal.

Here's how you could do the above - this example works with 10 8Mb objects 
in a R session with a limit of 40Mb.

# allow R only 40Mb of vector memory
mem.limits(vsize=40e6)
mem.limits()/1e6
library(trackObjs)
# start tracking to store data objects in the directory 'data'
# each object is 8Mb, and we store 10 of them
track.start("data")
n <- 10
m <- 1e6
constructObject <- function(i) i+rnorm(m)
# steps 1, 2 & 3:
for (i in 1:n) {
    xname <- paste("x", i, sep="")
    cat("", xname)
    assign(xname, constructObject(i))
    # store in a file, accessible by name:
    track(list=xname)
}
cat("\n")
gc(TRUE)
# accessing object by name
object.size(x1)/2^20 # In Mb
mean(x1)
mean(x2)
gc(TRUE)
# steps 4:6
# accessing object through a constructed name
result <- sapply(1:n, function(i) mean(get(paste("x", i, sep=""))))
result
# remove the data objects
track.remove(list=paste("x", 1:n, sep=""))
track.stop()

Here's the a full transcript of the above - note how whenever gc() is 
called there is hardly any vector memory in use.

How about this ? :

Subject: [R] using solve.qp without a quadratic term
Message-ID: <1808201.508981198287499445.JavaMail.root@vms125.mailsrvcs.net>

I was playing around with a simple example using solve.qp ( function is in the quadprog package ) and the code is below. ( I'm not even sure there if there is a reasonable solution because I made the problem up  ). 

But, when I try to use solve.QP to solve it, I get the error that D in the quadratic function is not positive
definite. This is because Dmat is zero
because I don't have a quadratic term in my
objective function. So, I was wondering if
it was possible to use solve.QP when there isn't
a quadratic term in the objective function.  

I imagine that there are other functions in R that can be used but I would like to use solve.QP because, in my real problem,
I will have a lot of fairly complex constraints
and solve.QP provides a very nice way for implementing
them. Maybe there is another linear solver that allows you to implement hundreds of constraints just solve.QP that I am unaware of ? Thanks for any suggestions.

# IN THE CODE BELOW, WE MINIMIZE 

# -3*b1 + 4*b2 + 6*b3

# SUBJECT TO

# b1 + b2 + b3 >=0
# -(b1  b2 + b3) >= 0 
# IE : b1 + b2 + b3 = 0.

Dmat <- matrix(0,3,3)          # QUADRATIC TERM
dvec <- c(-3,4,6)              # LINEAR TERM
Amat <- matrix(c(1,-1,0,1,-1,0,1,-1,0),3,3)

#print(Amat)

bvec = c(0,0,0)                  # THIRD ZERO IS SAME AS NO CONSTRAINT

result <- solve.QP(Dmat, dvec, Amat)

In the R.utils package there is seqToIntervals(), e.g.

print(seqToIntervals(1:10))
##      from to
## [1,]    1 10
print(seqToIntervals(c(1:10, 15:18, 20)))
##      from to
## [1,]    1 10
## [2,]   15 18
## [3,]   20 20

There is also seqToIntervals(), which uses the above, e.g.

print(seqToHumanReadable(1:10))
## [1] "1-10"
print(seqToHumanReadable(c(1:10, 15:18, 20)))
## [1] "1-10, 15-18, 20"

Dear all,

I'm trying to estimate the parameters of a special case of a poisson
model, where the specified equation has an integral and several fixed
parameters.
I think that the MLE command in STATS4 package could be a good choice,
but it's a little complicated. I've got some problems with the offset
and I don't understand some of the functions. Do you know where can I
find some explicit tutorial about a poisson regression with MLE or,
maybe better, about maximum likelyhood estimation?

Check out the drc package.

Also, please read the last line to every message to r-help regarding
reproducible code
and note that function names are case sensitive in R so NLS is not the
same as nls.

Because for some datasets the solution is sensitive to starting values, I first use OPTIM() with Nelder-Mead to locate the solution, and then plug the solution into NLS() (default algorithm) using the appropriate weights as a way to retrieve SEs, deviance, etc rather than computing these from OPTIM results.

When this solution is plugged into NLS(), the first evaluation yields the same value of the objective function as OPTIM().  NLS() then attempts steps, and apparently finds a slightly different solution with a smaller value for the objective function.  However, this new solution actually does not give a smaller objective function value, but rather a larger one, when verifed against an independent computation.  Hence, it appears that NLS is getting confused and taking a step based on erroneous computation of the objective function.

Yes, that's normal. Under windows, you get a GUI interface with menus
and separate windows etc. by default. In Linux you get to choose for
yourself how you interact with R. One of the better options is Emacs
with ESS. Details can be found at http://ESS.R-project.org/ including
rpms for suse. Other options are presented here:
http://www.sciviews.org/_rgui/

There will be a bit of a learning curve here, but eventually you'll
find you can do everything that you could do with the Windows GUI, and
at least with Emacs and ESS, a whole lot more.

How can I insert cross-references to odfWeave generated figures in my
source odf before the graphic has been created with odfWeave?

Many thanks,

But cutree does away with the indexes from the original input, which
rect.hclust retains.
I will have no other choice and match that input with the 'values' contained
in the clusters ...

Excellent, Tony!
That's just about what I had tried to do myself for half an hour
and didn't get around to..

So, I'd say you've clearly won the quiz. 
Congratulations!

If you can think of an appropriate price, please say so.
Otherwise, if we meet at the next useR! conference in
Dortmund.. it will be a beer or something like that..

RSiteSearch("matrix listw")

gets you to several threads on the R-sig-geo list, suggesting in your case:

w <- mat2listw(wdat)
# convert matrix to spatial weights list
write.nb.gal(w$neighbours, "wdat.gal")
# write neighbours component of spatial weights list as GAL file

If you want to retain the original rownames, then try:

 [1] 0.00 0.45 1.00 2.00 3.00 3.25 3.33 3.75 4.10 5.00 6.00 6.45 7.00 
7.10 8.00

#-----start cut-and-pastable-----
#this will "label" individual group membership
#diff(.) returns a vector that is smaller by one than its input
#so it needs to be augmented with c(1,fn(diff((.))

grp.v<-cbind(vector,(c(1,1+cumsum(as.numeric(diff(vector)>0.5)))))

#You can then tally up the counts in groups

tb<-table(grp.v[,2])
tb

#1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
#2 1 1 5 1 2 2 1 
# And apply the counts to the rows by doing a 
# "row count" lookup into tb[.]

grp.v<-cbind(grp.v,tb[grp.v[,2]])
grp.v

-----end cut and pastable------
  vector    
1   0.00 1 2
1   0.45 1 2
2   1.00 2 1
3   2.00 3 1
4   3.00 4 5
4   3.25 4 5
4   3.33 4 5
4   3.75 4 5
4   4.10 4 5
5   5.00 5 1
6   6.00 6 2
6   6.45 6 2
7   7.00 7 2
7   7.10 7 2
8   8.00 8 1

Further processing of the membership "label" might better be accomplished 
by converting the matrix to a dataframe, and then working with the 
membership "label" as a factor. If you only want to deal with the 
rownames and values of vector that have more than <x> values, that should 
be straightforward.

If you want indexes, i.e. 1, 2, 3, ... instead of the values in v you
can still use split -- just split on seq_along(v) instead of v (or if
v had names you might want to split along names(v)):

split(seq_along(v), ct)

and if you only want to retain groups with 2+ elements then
you can just Filter then out:

twoplus <- function(x) length(x) >= 2
Filter(twoplus, split(seq_along(v), ct))

Subject: [R] Understanding eval
Message-ID: <0B375093-6247-4700-A793-2C46C5462E05@gmail.com>

After many hours of debugging code, I came to the conclusion that I  
have a fundamental misunderstanding regarding eval, and hope that  
someone here can explain to me, why the following code acts as it does:

foo <- function(expr) {
   eval(substitute(expr), envir=list(a=5), enclos=parent.frame())
}
bar <- function(er) {
   foo(er)
}

 > foo(a)
[1] 5
 > bar(a)
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : object "a" not found


Now, regarding the "bar(a)" call, this is my understanding of what  
happens, hoping someone will correct me where I'm wrong.

1) bar is called. Its evaluation frame contains the association "er=a".
2) bar calls foo. So foo is called, and its evaluation frame contains  
the association "expr=er", with enclosing environment the local  
environment of bar.
3) foo calls eval.
4) eval starts by evaluating "substitute(expr)" in foo's environment.  
"substitute" then locates expr in foo's environment, and replaces it  
with er. So the result of this process is the symbol er, which is  
what will now be evaluated by eval.
5) eval then creates the environment where this evaluation will take  
place. It does that by creating an environment containing the frame  
"a=5", and with enclosing environment the parent frame of foo, which  
is bar's environment.
6) So, as I understand it, the symbol "er" is going to now be  
evaluated in an environment where a is set to 5 and er is set to a,  
along with whatever is in the user's workspace.
7) So the first step now is looking up a definition for er. Nothing  
is found in the current frame, so the evaluation proceeds to bar's  
environment, where the association "er=a" is found, so er is replaced  
by a.
8) Now, and perhaps this is where I misunderstand things, the lookup  
for a will take place. My thinking was that the lookup would start  
from the evaluation environment that eval created, and hence would  
locate the a=5 value. But this is clearly not what happens.

Anyway, hope someone will correct me where I'm wrong, and explain to  
me what I am doing wrong, and ideally how to diagnose such things.

I think this part is wrong.  A better description is:

er is going to be evaluated in an environment where a is set to 5.  The 
parent of that environment is the bar evaluation frame, where er is set 
to be a promise to evaluate a in the global environment.

No, at this point an attempt is made to force the promise.  Promises 
have their own associated environments, and that's where the evaluation 
takes place.  In the case of the er object, the associated environment 
is the one where bar(a) was called, i.e. the global environment.

Diagnosing things like this is hard.  Promises are very difficult things 
to look at:  as soon as you try to do anything with them they get 
evaluated, and there's no way in R code to display them without that.
You can use substitute() to extract the expression part, but there's no 
way to extract the environment part.  Maybe there should be, but it's 
tricky to get the semantics right.  If the function environment() worked 
to extract the environment of a promise, then all sorts of code would 
fail where I really wanted to evaluate the arg before extracting the 
environment.

Hi everyone, 

say i have a population (stable) with different amounts of animals in every
ageclass (80 of age 1, 60 of age 2, etc) in a vector.
Can anybody tell me how i can add gender (male or female) to all ageclasses?
I want a 1:1 ratio of males and females within the population (as a starting
value). So, 40 males and 40 females of age 1, 30m-30f of age 2, etc etc... 

Any help would be greatly appreciated!! 

Kind regards

Thank you Duncan, for the very clear explanation.

Ok, so the substitute "breaks through" the promise of expr, returning  
as a language object the promise of er, and there's no easy way to  
break through that. I ended up with the following, somewhat uglier  
than I wanted, code, which seems to do what I need in this case, and  
hopefully will still work in the more general case I want it to. The  
idea was to break through the er promise in bar, before sending it  
over to foo. Then foo receives simply an expression, which it can  
then evaluate. Though I seem to have had to work a bit harder on that  
part than I expected to. Perhaps there's an easier way? Or things  
that can go seriously wrong with this way?

foo <- function(fr, expr) {
   ..obj <- list(.=fr)
   ..expr <- substitute(expr)
   ..txt <- parse( text=paste("substitute(",..expr,")") )
   ..expr <- eval(..txt, ..obj, parent.frame())
   ..expr <- eval(..expr, parent.frame())
   eval(..expr, ..obj)
}
bar <- function(parent, er, ...) {
   .fr=parent
   g <- substitute(er)
   foo(.fr, g)
}

 > foo(5,.)
[1] 5
 > bar(5,.)
[1] 5

Hi Louis,

If I am understanding your question correctly, here is one way:
suppose your matrix is M of dimension n x k.

D <- data.frame(M)  # convert to data frame
ones <- rep(1, n)   # a column of 1s

Now you can count the number of repeats of each unique row.

aggregate( ones, by = as.list(D), FUN = sum)

The output will be a data frame with the unique rows, and a column at
the end labeled "x" with the frequency of each unique row.

Once you get this you can convert to a list, manipulate, etc.  I am
sure that there exist faster/better methods.

Best,
Jay

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] new version of trackObjs
Message-ID: <476DBAD2.1020700@acm.org>

The trackObjs package stores objects in files on disk so that files are
automatically rewritten when objects are changed, and so
that objects are accessible but do not occupy memory until
they are accessed. Also tracks times when objects are created
and modified, and caches some basic characteristics of objects
to allow for fast summaries of objects.

This version trackObjs_0.8-0 fixes some bugs:

     o   Fixed faulty detection of conflicting existing objects
         when starting to track to an existing directory.

     o   Replaced environment on function that is in the active
         binding for a tracked object.  Previously, that function
         could, if constructed via track(obj <- value), have a
         copy of the tracked object in its environment, which would
         stay present taking up memory even if the object was
         flushed out of the tracking environment.

     o   Fixed bug that stopped track.stop(all=TRUE) from working

Duncan has already pointed out that consideration of promises is
what is missing in the description but in addition the way lm and
other functions in R get around it is to use match.call like this:

bar2 <- function(er) {
	mc <- match.call()
	mc[[1]] <- as.name("foo")
	names(mc)[[2]] <- "expr"
	eval.parent(mc)
}
bar2(a)

That's a very good idea. I'll have to see if and how it applies to  
the more general case I'm dealing with.  ( Essentially I am trying to  
create "tkcbind" and "tkrbind" kind of functions, that group together  
tcltk widgets under a new frame they create, and the frame has to be  
created before the widgets are and the widgets should be created with  
the frame as their parent  etc. ... ). Anyway, that's another story  
for another day ;).

Hi Louis,
If you want the unique rows returned, this might do the job.

unique.rows<-function(x) {
  nrows<-dim(x)[1]
  urows<-1:nrows
  for(i in 1:(nrows-1)) {
   for(j in (i+1):nrows) {
    if(!is.na(urows[j])) if(all(x[i,]==x[j,])) urows[j]<-NA
   }
  }
  return(x[urows[!is.na(urows)],])
}

i didn't test, but i think you want something like:

table(apply(x, 1, paste, collapse=","))

where "x" is your matrix...

In the current (0.6.0) version, you can't. I wrote some modifications to
odfWeave in this direction, planning to send them back to Max Kuhn after
some testing, but am currently unable to work on them.

Basically, you have to separate the creation of a reference to a
table|figure from the creation of the table|figure itself. The simplest
way is to be able 1) to create some forme of R object containing the
necessary reference info, 2) to use such an R object in ordre to insert
the XML code for reference and|or 3) to pass such an object as an
optional argument to table|figure caption creation.

My current set of functions allows all of the above, but is not
correctly integrated in the package, and has not been tested extensively.

HTH,

I think you want

..txt <- parse( text=paste("substitute(",deparse(..expr),")") )

here, but it's even better not to go through the deparse-parse cycle:

..txt <- bquote( substitute( .(..expr) ) )

The main thing that could go wrong is the evaluation of er might not be 
right.  Just because it is an argument to bar doesn't mean bar's frame 
or parent.frame() is the right place to evaluate it.

To check for errors, I'd introduce like-named variables at lots of 
levels, and then put them into the expression you were evaluating in 
such a way that you can tell which one was found.  For example, put
x <- "foo" into foo(), x <- "bar" into bar(), and x <- "global" into the 
global environment.  Then evaluate some expression that prints x and 
make sure you see the right one.

Sorry, this wasn't written clearly:  This was a response to your second 
question, not a continuation of the bquote() suggestion.

I can not say anything about SW, but LyX can do the same. I have a paper, that
will probably appear in next issues of Rnews about using Sweave in LyX.

pat <- paste(M$s1,M$s2)

## to find the first subset:
M[ pat == pat[1] ,]

## to find the second subset:
M[ pat == pat[2], ]

## and so on, for however many unique patterns there are.

## also try
table(pat)

Of course, your example does more than just "find" the subsets. It 
also does some summarizing of them. That's a little more complicated. 
I might start with the summarize() function in the Hmisc package, but 
there are potentially many ways to also do the summarizing.

Considering that the last name of the person with the most publications 
in this area is "Hyndman" (and is author of the R packages, deomgraphy 
and forecasting), I am wondering if the problem is simply spelling.
See:

Message-ID: <36979.56041.qm@web35613.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi all,
  I am pretty new to R and even new to programming in general. Right now i get only one value for
j below (print(j)), how do i save all j values to one vector or matrix? Sorry for this very basic
question. thanks in advance.

wave2 <- abs(Re(rnorm(100)))
i <- findInterval((wave2[1]), wave2)
i <- i+1

while (i < length(wave2))  {
j <- (wave2 [i] - wave2[i-1])
print(j)
i<-i+1
}

Subject: [R]  expand.grid function
Message-ID: <14484403.post@talk.nabble.com>


useR's,

I have used expand.grid() several times and like the results it gives me.  I
am now trying something with it that I have not been able to get to work. 
For any n column matrix I would like to run this function on those n columns
and store the results.
For example, if my matrix has 1 column then this is just expand.grid(x =
column1).  If my matrix has two columns, then I want expand.grid(x =
column1, y = column2), and so on for any number of columns...

In a program I am writing, the user can specify any matrix.  Does anyone
know of a way for R to calculate this based on what the input matrix is? 
e.g. if this user gives a 3 column matrix, I want to be able to perform
expand.grid() on these 3 columns without having to hard code it b/c I want
to have this small function embedded in my code and the results stored as a
variable.

If this isn't clear, I can try to be more detailed.  Thank you for any
thoughts.

Derek

Does this do what you want  (x is the matrix)?

do.call(expand.grid, as.data.frame(x))

Subject: [R] saving while loop values to one vector
Message-ID: <892880.33148.qm@web35610.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I solved it myself by reading the help files which i should have done prior to my posting. 

Solution:

wave2 <- abs(Re(rnorm(100)))
wave2 <- sort (wave2, decreasing=F)
hist(wave2)
x <- length (wave2)
i <- findInterval((wave2[1]), wave2)
i <- i+1
out <- numeric(x)
for (i in i:x)  {
out[i] <- (wave2 [i] - wave2[i-1])
}
out

As you see i trimmed the code and alloted a new variable called out which i later save my values
to.

Its not clear what your code is intended to do but

- put set.seed(123) before your code so you can
run it reproducibly.

- wave2 <- sort(abs(rnorm(100))) is the same as your first
two lines

- your findInterval line always returns 1 so its probably not what you want

- i in i:x is confusing. Use j in i:x or even better use diff(wave2).

I agree. In the meantime you learn emacs ;-), cosider using this functions:

getwd()
setwd()
save.image()
install.packages()

and  you can install Rmdr and run

library(Rcmdr)

Anyway, I prefer GNU Emacs + ESS, but it can take a bit more time to learn.

To answer your firs question try

M[-which( M$s1 == 0 & M$s2 == 0),]

For the second question, you must start with the more
precise definition of the grouping criterion.

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] anacor: yet another ca package
Message-ID: <E99D0798-917F-4C4B-A951-C25D86A3175F@stat.ucla.edu>

anacor-0.9.0 is on CRAN (by De Leeuw and Mair)

anacor does correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence
analysis. It can make row plots, column plots,
joint plots, Benz?cri plots, regression plots,
and transformation plots. Where appropriate, plots can
be in 3d using either rgl or scatterplot3d. Row and
column points can be in standard scaling, Benz?cri
scaling, Goodman scaling, row-centroid, or column-centroid
scaling.

The summary method writes out a table with the chi-square
(inertia) decomposition, it also writes out the singular
values, and their asymptotic standard errors under multinomial
sampling. Plots of the category quantifications (row scores
and column scores) can be made optionally with asymptotic
confidence ellipses, again based on multinomial sampling.

The package contain various utilities to switch data formats,
in particular to transform data frames to Burt matrices,
to indicator matrices, and even to fuzzy indicator matrices
using B-spline bases.

The vignette for the package (not added yet) is a paper
also submitted to the special psychoR issue of JSS. You
can get a preprint at

http://idisk.mac.com/jdeleeuw-Public/psychoR/anacor.zip

The psychoR directory also has the anacor package, the
homals package, and the homals paper. smacof (many forms
of multidimensional scaling) is next.

Yes, indeed, *the* S- / R- answer.

and note that this also works with sparse matrices:

Subject: [R] Help with read.zoo and transform
Message-ID: <000001c84631$30d81af0$9dc80d56@Paula>

R 

I get a daily feed of data over the internet that I keep in various .csv
files. 

I have built a function that reads that data into R for me:

getMarketData<-function(market)
{
	library(zoo)
	pathname<- "C:/DATA/"
	files<-c("AN_REV.csv","AX_REV.csv","BN_REV.csv")
	markets<-c("AUS","DAX","GBP")
	df<-read.zoo(paste(pathname,files[match(market,markets)],sep=""),
index.column=1, format="%m/%d/%Y", header=F, sep=",")
	df
}

This works fine and returns the dataset as planned:

              V2    V3    V4    V5   V6   V7
1990-01-02 54.89 54.99 54.61 54.61  125 2576
1990-01-03 54.48 54.62 54.29 54.33 1495 3232
1990-01-04 54.67 55.20 54.59 55.08  932 3145
1990-01-05 54.64 54.87 54.57 54.57  272 2567
1990-01-08 54.87 54.89 54.68 54.79  177 2456
1990-01-09 54.87 54.96 54.80 54.88  106 2403

Also if I type the following:

mode(df[1,1])

>"numeric"

That is, my data is treated as numeric (which is as it should be).

Here is where I get a problem. I'd like to add some more columns on to the
end of the dataset to represent the year, quarter, month, and day.

If I try the following within the function it won't work:

df<-transform(df, "Year"=format(time(df), "%Y"))

Curiously, if I do exactly the same line by line in R (i.e. without
specifying a function) then it works fine. Is there any reason why I cannot
use transform in a function?

I also tried a different approach as shown below i.e within my original
function I added the following lines after I had created df:

df[,8:11]<-0
df[,7]<-format(time(df), format="%Y")
df[,8]<-quarters(time(df))
df[,9]<-months(time(df))
df[,10]<-weekdays(time(df))

This worked fine however it changed all my data from numeric to character:

           Open  High  Low   Close Volume OI   Year Quarter Month   Day

1990-01-04 54.67 55.2  54.59 55.08 932    3145 1990 Q1      January Thursday

1990-01-08 54.87 54.89 54.68 54.79 177    2456 1990 Q1      January Monday

1990-01-09 54.87 54.96 54.8  54.88 106    2403 1990 Q1      January Tuesday


mode(df[1,1])

>"character"

Why does my numeric data get changed into character?

Can anybody see a simple way to add the data I require whilst retaining the
"numeric" format?

Regards

zoo objects are intended to represent time series and are
based on vectors and matrices, like ts objects, not data frames.
See ?zoo

Create your new columns as numeric variables:

> library(zoo)
> library(chron) # need chron 2.3-16 for month.day.year

> with(month.day.year(time(z)), cbind(z, year, month, day, quarter = (month - 1) %/% 3 + 1, dow = as.numeric(format(time(z), "%w"))))
           z.1 z.2 z.3 z.4 year month day quarter dow

So you want to solve a *linear* programming problem,
not a quadratic.  Linear is typically considerably easier.

The recommended (and hence always installed) package 'boot'
has function simplex() to do this
and I see two other CRAN packages 'linprog' and 'lpSolve' also
for the same problem;  since ?simplex says that it may not be
very efficient for large problems, you would e.g. lpSolve
instead.

Martin

Subject: [R] curve fitting problem
Message-ID: <29494967.1198505049212.JavaMail.root@wombat.diezmil.com>

I'm trying to fit a function y=k*l^(m*x) to some data points, with  reasonable starting value estimates (I think). I keep getting "singular matrix 'a' in solve".

This is the code:

ox <- c(-600,-300,-200,1,100,200)
ir <- c(1,2.5,4,9,14,20)
model <- nls(ir ~ k*l^(m*ox),start=list(k=10,l=3,m=0.004),algorithm="plinear")
summary(model)
plot(ox,ir)
testox <- seq(-600,200,length=100)
k <- 10
l <- 3
m <- 0.004
testir <- k*l^(m*testox)
lines(testox,testir)

Any thoughts?
Thanks!

Your model is singular.  Varying m and log(l) have the same
effect: log(ir) = log(k) + m * log(l) * ox

Also with plinear you don't specify the linear coefficients but
rather an X matrix whose coefficients represent them:
If we use this model instead:

ir = k * exp(m * ox)

Then:

> mod0 <- lm(log(ir) ~ ox)
> mod0

Call:
lm(formula = log(ir) ~ ox)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)           ox
   2.199743     0.003835

> nls(ir ~ exp(m * ox), start = list(m = coef(mod0)[2]), algorithm = "plinear")
Nonlinear regression model
  model:  ir ~ exp(m * ox)
   data:  parent.frame()
       m     .lin
0.003991 9.091758
 residual sum-of-squares: 0.3551

 Hi all:
I am trying to draw a horizontal line along the zero
"Y axis" value but since zero isn't showing therefore
the line is not drawn. If I set my intercept to 15
then it'll work but I dont want to hardcode it because
the Y axis parameters could be different for another
variable. I would like to alway set my hline along the
zero as default. Thanks

p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y=mpg)) + geom_point()
p + geom_hline(intercept=0)

Thanks Gabor!
   I never realized there could be a "diff" function. all i was trying to do was to calculate the
iterated differences in a vector. I feel so embarassed, but so happy for using R. 
by the way, i used 
"wave2 <- sort (wave2, decreasing=F)" to sort the values non-decreasingly because the code "i <-
findInterval((wave2[1]), wave2)" doesnt work without this sorting. 
But all that is past now since i found the diff function. 

Thanks again.

Subject: [R] R Compilation error on Ubuntu
Message-ID: <1198522331.13205.8.camel@2WIRE387.gateway.2wire.net>

Hi

I bought a new laptop HP dv9500 just a week ago and installed a Ubuntu
gutsy ribbon on this laptop. I wanted to install Fedora but there are
more threads on Ubuntu, so I decided to install Ubuntu. After hours of
struggle in configuring x server/graphic card stuff, I installed R for
Gutsy ribbon using "sudo apt-get install g77 r-core'. 

Now when I tried to install 'sp' package I got this error message: 

Warning in install.packages("sp") : argument 'lib' is missing: using
'/usr/local/lib/R/site-library'
--- Please select a CRAN mirror for use in this session ---

The downloaded packages are in
        /tmp/RtmpfOk3H7/downloaded_packages
Warning message:
installation of package 'sp' had non-zero exit status in:
install.packages("sp") 

Then, I removed this gutsy ribbon version of R and attempted to install
fresh R-2.6.1.tar.gz. When I tried to build it, I got this error
message:

configure: error: --with-readline=yes (default) and headers/libs are not
available

I installed xserver-xorg-dev ok. 

I am using Fedora 6 on my desktop and have never seen these above error
messages. Should I install a Fedora and R on it? Or should I just create
a link using 'ln -s'? 

I appreciate your help.

Have a festive holiday!

That is the default for sort.   Its not necessary to specify defaults.
 Also its better practice to
write out F as FALSE since F can be a variable in R but FALSE cannot be.

You might want to try R-SIG-Debian for this kind of question. Here are 
instructions from Dirk in response to my similar question a few days ago.

HTH,

You're close: 'r-base-dev' gives you (about) everything to run
'install.package()' once you have R; libX11-dev ought to give you everything
but somehow doesn't so ...

...  use the 'apt-get build-dep $package' command, ie

	$ sudo apt-get build-dep r-base

which will pull in this list (as per the current Debian unstable package):

Build-Depends: gcc (>= 4:4.1.0), g++ (>= 4:4.1.0), gfortran (>= 
4:4.1.0), refblas3-dev | atlas3-base-dev, tcl8.4-dev, tk8.4-dev, bison, 
groff-base, libncurses5-dev, libreadline5-dev, debhelper (>= 5.0.0), 
texi2html, texinfo (>= 4.1-2), libbz2-dev, libpcre3-dev, tetex-bin, 
tetex-extra, xpdf-reader, zlib1g-dev, libpng12-dev, libjpeg62-dev, 
libx11-dev, libxt-dev, x-dev

So in this particular case, libxt-dev and x-dev were still missing.

'apt-get build-dep $foo' is really convenient. Try 'apt-get source $foo' as
well to get sources (if you have entries like

	deb-src http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free

I use that all the time to fetch Debian sources onto Ubuntu machines at
work.  It may at times conflict with what packages Ubuntu has, or what names
they used -- but for R and one or two dozen other Debian packages it has
always been useful for me on Ubuntu too.

Cheers, Dirk

Subject: [R] aggregation with two statistical functions - mean and variance
Message-ID: <003101c84673$d42a3b60$6702a8c0@PFEIFFER>

Hello, 

using the syntax 

aggregate(daten[,c(3,4)], list(A,B), mean)

I'm getting the following data.frame:


    A     B        C                    D       
1  35    1         6.16000          5
2  47    1        31.24333         20
3  54    1        26.81773         2
4   3     2        12.99000         7
5   4     2         6.49000          1

C and D are both means. But now I want to have: C is mean, D is variance. 

How can I do this by using/ changing the aggregation syntax?

Thanks! 

Macki

You may have a binary install of the package; you need the source.  Look 
in http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/gam_0.98.tar.gz, files 
gam/src/backfit.f and gam/src/backlo.f

Subject: [R]  Problems with EMACS-ESS on Ubuntu
Message-ID: <14492497.post@talk.nabble.com>


I installed EMACS-ESS on Windows XP-Pro and it worked with R perfectly right
out of the box. I was impressed with how easy it is to use (I normally use
Tinn-R). I then switched over to Ubuntu 7.10 and installed EMACS-ESS.
Everything worked the same as in Windows (which is my main reason for using
EMACS) until I tried to send a line of code from the EMACS buffer to R -- R
is running but the code just will not go to it. All I get is a line at the
bottom of the editor window that says "Process to load into: R". I am new to
EMACS and did not see any fixes that looked promising in the ESS manual. Can
anyone offer some suggestions on things to check? Thanks.

Tom

  Emacs just wants you to confirm which buffer the code is getting
sent to (and the buffer called "R" is its default).  The focus should
automatically have gotten set to the mini-buffer at the bottom of the
window, so if you just hit ENTER in response to this query everything
should work fine!

First of all, thanks so much! In fact I had looked at the site  
before. But, that site leads me to the following site:

http://www.vsthost.com/vstDocs/mgarchBEKK/

but it was not clear to me where I can find the package to download &  
compile. Is there some special website I need go to in order to  
download the package? Thanks again!

Hi Felipe,
It sounds like you want to include zero in the axis. In base graphics, 
you would use:

ylim=c(0,maxy)

where maxy specifies the upper end of the ordinate. I had a quick look 
at the ggplot2 docs, but I haven't yet found whether this works in that 
system.

Subject: [R] R Compilation error on Ubuntu
Message-ID: <972178.28791.qm@web39712.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi Taka,

I was just trying to do this yesterday and ran into the same problem (compiling R 2.6.1 on Gutsy Gibbon). Apparently this happens on Debian/Ubuntu distributions because the developer install is separate from the user install.

Basically, to address the configure error:

"--with-readline=yes (default) and headers/libs are not available"

you need the development version of readline:
  sudo apt-get install libreadline5-dev
(see http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html)

Later, I ran into another configure error:
"--with-x=yes (default) and X11 headers/libs are not available"
so I installed xorg-dev:
  sudo apt-get install xorg-dev
(see http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/e2/help/06/11/5193.html)

At the end, I also got a configure WARNING:
"you cannot build info or HTML versions of the R manuals "
so then I installed texinfo:
  sudo apt-get install texinfo
(see http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/e2/help/07/04/15498.html)

Hope this helps,

ST

Hi

I bought a new laptop HP dv9500 just a week ago and installed a Ubuntu
gutsy ribbon on this laptop. I wanted to install Fedora but there are
more threads on Ubuntu, so I decided to install Ubuntu. After hours of
struggle in configuring x server/graphic card stuff, I installed R for
Gutsy ribbon using "sudo apt-get install g77 r-core'. 

Now when I tried to install 'sp' package I got this error message: 

Warning in install.packages("sp") : argument 'lib' is missing: using
'/usr/local/lib/R/site-library'

Then, I removed this gutsy ribbon version of R and attempted to install
fresh R-2.6.1.tar.gz. When I tried to build it, I got this error
message:

configure: error: --with-readline=yes (default) and headers/libs are

available

I installed xserver-xorg-dev ok. 

I am using Fedora 6 on my desktop and have never seen these above error
messages. Should I install a Fedora and R on it? Or should I just
 create
a link using 'ln -s'? 

I appreciate your help.

thank you,  I downloaded and installed the package. With library(help="doBy") 
I got the information about this package.

But when I use the syntax

summaryBy(daten[,c(3:4)], list(A,B), Fun=c(var,mean))

I got the following error:
<<Fehler: konnte Funktion "summaryBy" nicht finden>> (error: couldn't find 
function summaryBy)

I tried before
require(doBy), but this doesn't work neither.

What can I do?

Subject: [R]  expand.grid function



useR's,

I have used expand.grid() several times and like the results it gives
 me.  I
am now trying something with it that I have not been able to get to
 work. 
For any n column matrix I would like to run this function on those n
 columns
and store the results.
For example, if my matrix has 1 column then this is just expand.grid(x
 =
column1).  If my matrix has two columns, then I want expand.grid(x =
column1, y = column2), and so on for any number of columns...

In a program I am writing, the user can specify any matrix.  Does
 anyone
know of a way for R to calculate this based on what the input matrix
 is? 
e.g. if this user gives a 3 column matrix, I want to be able to perform
expand.grid() on these 3 columns without having to hard code it b/c I
 want
to have this small function embedded in my code and the results stored
 as a
variable.

If this isn't clear, I can try to be more detailed.  Thank you for any
thoughts.

Derek

Make sure you did this:

install.packages("doBy")
library(doBy)
library(help = doBy)
?summaryBy
example(summaryBy)

which installs the package on your computer, loads the package into your
session, shows help for the package, shows help
for the summaryBy function and runs the examples, respectively. Read
the help page carefully and follow the examples.

Also read the posting guide and follow the instructions on the
last line of every message to r-help.

Subject: [R] both lines and plot characters in a lattice plot key
Message-ID: <33F086AA-0408-4904-B471-00C391C2E281@web.de>

Hello,

I have two short questions concerning a key (legend) in a lattice  
plot. I have points represented by two different plot characters  
(crosses and circles) and they are colored from light to dark gray. I  
would like to have 3 parts in my legend showing the two different  
plot characters in the first two lines and the last line should  
consist of a line segment for explaining the different shades of  
gray. Below you can see what I reached so far.
My first problem is, that I do not get the 2 plot characters and the  
line segment vertically aligned to each other (I chose the vector of  
plotting characters to contain "26" as last element, because this  
leaves out a plotting character for the last line, where the line  
segment should be placed). So how do I get these aligned?
My second question is, if it's possible to have a line segment shown  
in the key, which is colored from light to dark gray (instead of a  
single color), matching the colors in my specified variable "colors"  
if possible, i.e. a single line segment starting from light gray and  
ending with a dark gray.

Thanks very much in advance!

Jan

I tried google and I find

Perhaps it's more easy to install this manner.

Yes indeed. As usual, I found the answer to my question shortly after I
posted it to the forum. John Fox clearly describes this behavior in his
paper "An Introduction to ESS + XEmacs for Windows Users of R". I guess I
was confused because the version of Emacs/ESS I installed on Windows
(courtesy of Vincent Goulet) did not require me to confirm that I wanted to
use R. Thanks everyone for the assistance.

Felipe,
 
You'll need to define the limits yourself with scale_y_continuous.
 
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y=mpg)) + geom_point()
p + geom_hline(intercept=0) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, max(mtcars$mpg)))

Cheers,
 
Thierry

Hi Felipe,
It sounds like you want to include zero in the axis. In base graphics,
you would use:

ylim=c(0,maxy)

where maxy specifies the upper end of the ordinate. I had a quick look
at the ggplot2 docs, but I haven't yet found whether this works in that
system.

The 'lines' components allow a 'type' specification, so:

       key =
       list(x=0.2,y=0.2,
            lines=list(pch=c(1,3,1), type = c("p", "p", "l")),
            text=list(c("key 1","key 2","key 3")),
            align=T,transparent=T)

Unfortunately, no, at least not using the 'key' argument.  However,
using the 'legend' argument gives you more flexibility, especially if
you are willing to write some grid code. Even without grid, you can
use draw.key() and draw.colorkey() together to produce one legend for
the plotting characters and a different one for the color gradient.

Or

p + geom_hline(intercept=0) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, NA))

-  the NA means that it will calculate the maximum from the data.

Subject: [R] Removing duplicate packages...
Message-ID: <47720BF4.7070308@ff.ns.ac.yu>

Hello!
I am using R version 2.6.1, under Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper Drake). Recently I 
have realized that I have, in some cases, two or even three instances of 
the same package; for example: cluster, foreign etc. Typically, two 
instances occur in one of the three location: 
"/usr/local/lib/R/site-library", "/usr/lib/R/site-library", or 
"/usr/lib/R/library", and the third is, I suppose, part of the core system.
I would really like to clean up my system, but the question is how to do 
that. Can anyone help me, please?

Sincerely,
PM

remove.packages(installed.packages()[duplicated(rownames(installed.packages())),1],

Subject: [R] persp(): how to control the distance between the axis and the
	axis labels
Message-ID: <AC81D974-454E-4254-A877-A8C7D8159BAC@gmail.com>

Hi,

I have been using persp() to draw 3D surface plots of my data,
but I always run into a small problem: If use the standard settings,  
the axis
labels always end up too close and overlapping the the axis numbers.  
Is there
any setting for controlling the distance between the axis labels and the
axis themselves? I have been going through the persp() and par()  
documentation,
and I could not find anything.

In case it is of any help, this is the call I am using:

est <- bkde2D(x, bandwidth=c(2,0.1))
persp(x=est$x1, y=est$x2, z=est$fhat, phi =30, theta =20, d=  
5,ticktype="detailed", xlab="Beta'", ylab="K'", zlab="Density",  
main="Grammar Based")

Best regards,

Artur.

Message-ID: <004701c847f2$ae9335c0$6702a8c0@PFEIFFER>

Hello,

it seems to be a simple problem, but  I couldn't find an answer in the 
archiv. (I think, it must has something to do with the group-select, like in 
php)

I've the following data.frame:

        A            B                C
1      3             6                 5
2      4             4                 20
3      5             8                 2

I want to get the number of the rows in the 4th column, like:

        A            B                C                      num rows
1      3            6                 6.16                  3


(B is mean, C is variance by using summaryBy(B+C~ A,  data=daten, 
FUN=c(mean,var))  from the doBy-package)

But, how can I add the column 'numrow' and count the number of the rows?

Thanks!

Macki

If i understand your question, you can try this:

cbind(summaryBy(B+C~ A,  data=df,FUN=c(mean, var)), 'num
rows'=as.numeric(table(df$A)))

Subject: [R] Reminiscing on 20 years using S
Message-ID: <07E228A5BE53C24CAD490193A7381BBBDB7058@LP-EXCHVS07.CO.IHC.COM>


I realized earlier this year (2007) that it was in 1987 that I first
started using an early version of S (it was ported to VMS and was called
success).  That means that I have been using some variant of S (to
various degrees) for over 20 years now (I don't feel that old).  

Since things are a bit slow this time of year I thought I would take a
few minutes and reminisce on some of the changes I have observed since I
first encountered that early version.  Some of the newer users may enjoy
seeing how much things have improved and maybe some of the other more
experienced users would like to chime in with their observations.

We would access that old version using dumb terminals (the computer that
actually did the work was down the hall in a locked air-conditioned room
(and it took up a good chunk of the room)).  We did graphics using
essentially ASCII art.  There was not a default graphics driver in those
days and we would specify the "printer()" driver, then do the graphics
commands, then use the "show()" command to actually print out the graph
(with '*' for points and - for the x axis, | for the y axis and + for
tick marks), we thought it was pretty impressive at the time that the
computer would do that for us.  Later I learned that our terminals could
understand both vt100 and tek4010 protocols so we would do all the
typing and textual output in vt100 mode, then switch to tek for the
graphs, having actual lines made the graphs look a lot better, but it
was a lot slower, you could see each point added to the graph.  And if
you forgot to switch back to text mode, then you next output would be
plotted (1 character at a time) over the top of the graph.

In order to get color graphs or other high quality graphs we had to send
the plots to the old hp pen plotter which had a mechanical arm that
would pick up the pens and move them around the paper (fun to watch, but
slow, very slow on curves).  That is where the origin of using color
numbers came from, color 1 matched with whichever pen was in slot #1,
color 2 with slot 2, ... And the computer did not know which color was
which (we tried to keep black in position 1, but someone could always
change that).  If you wanted to use colors 5-8 then it would stop and
beep, then you would change the pens to the other set of colors.  A line
width of 2 meant drawing the line 2 times, etc.  And there were no
filled rectangles, only density and angle of hash lines in them (if the
density was high enough it would look like a fill, but it would use up
the pens to fast and make you unpopular).

The current 600+ colors in R are a luxury now.

I remember before I learned about attaching to the search list (I don't
know if it was because attaching was not mature yet, or I just had not
learned it) we would name our objects using a pattern like: proj1.x,
proj1.y, proj2.x, proj2.y, ... where proj1 and proj2 were identifiers
for the projects (what I would name a data frame now) then there was a
prefix function that you could set proj1 as a prefix and just type x and
it would use proj1.x.  Attaching was a huge jump forward, and the 'with'
command is pure luxury in comparison (I just need to remember to
appreciate little things like that more).

It is amazing how much the S language (S-plus and R) have
changed/improved in the last 20 years.  Thanks to all the great people
who have contributed and thanks for letting me wax nostalgic for a bit.

Hello all: Any ideas on how can I set the X axis
limits to week 1? I tried the
scale_x_continuous(limits=c(1,NA)
but I get an error message. It works for the Y axis
though.

library(ggplot2)
df <- data.frame(date = seq(Sys.Date(), len=100, by="1
day")[sample(100, 50)],price = runif(50))
df <- df[order(df$date), ]
dt <- qplot(date, price, data=df, geom="line")
dt$aspect.ratio <- 1/4
dt + scale_x_date()
 dt + scale_x_date(format="%m/%d")
 dt + scale_x_date(format="%W")+
scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, NA))

You can only have one x scale - the last one overrides all the others.
 The date scale (currently) doesn't have a limits setting (what units
would you specify it in?), but you could use subset to plot only the
subject of interest.

this works now,

'numrows'=as.numeric(table(df$A)))


but now, I cannot add another column D beside A, as I do before, like

cbind(summaryBy(B+C~ A+D,  data=df,FUN=c(mean, var)), 
'numrows'=as.numeric(table(df$A)))

because of this D, I got the following error message in german:
<<Fehler in data.frame(..., check.names = FALSE) :  Argumente implizieren 
unterschiedliche Anzahl Zeilen: 21, 18>>

<<error in data.frame(...., check.names = FALSE): arguments has differents 
counts of rows: 21, 18>>

has anybody an idea, what I can do ?

If the default value is a constant such as in

f <- function(x = 1) x

then formals(f)[[1]] will give it to you but it could be an expression
referring to other variables (other arguments, other variables in
the function, free variables) such as

f <- function(x = u, u) x

or

f <- function(x = u+v+w, u) { v <- u+1; x }

in which case you would get an object of class
"name" in the first case or "call" in the second.

Suppose I have a function f1(x,...) that calls a function f2(y1,y2,...,yn) in the following way: if x satisfies a certain condition, then I want to call f2(x,y2,...,yn); otherwise I want to use the default value of y1, if there is one.

Boxing day somehow seems appropriate for this thread.  R.I.P. to all  
those old boxes
of yesteryore and the software that ran on them -- and yet there is  
always a residual  archaeological curiosity.

I discovered recently that the MIT athena network contains a circa  
1989 version
of S:  http://stuff.mit.edu/afs/athena/astaff/project/Sdev/S/  which  
made me wonder
whether there was any likelihood that one could recreate "S Thu Dec  7  
16:49:47 EST 1989".
Curiosity is one thing, time to dig through the layers of ancient  
civilizations is quite another.
But if anyone would like to offer a (preferably educated) guess about  
the feasibility of  such a project, like I said, I would be curious.

There are at least a couple of "gotchas" that should be noted, however:

1. The files = data.frames can only be rbind-ed (?is this the past tense of
rbind?) if the columns have the same names as well as numbers.

2. The corresponding column classes must be the same for all data.frames.
You may not get errors if this is not true, but silent coercions may end up
changing things from what you expect.

Editorial Comment: I find that both these issues often cause problems in
reading in spreadsheets due to a)typos and inconsistencies in column names
and character columns (especially with spaces and caps)-- which by default
become factors --  and stray characters (e.g., commas or "$" in American
numeric and financial columns). It's very easy for such little problems to
slip into Excel spreadsheets unless the creators are very fastidious, which
most of us aren't. My subjective estimate is that >50% -- and probably
closer to 90% -- of "uncurated" spreadsheets (as opposed to e.g. structured
databases) contain such problems.

Hopefully these issues will not bedevil you.

Subject: [R] Can you recover default argument values of a function?

Thank you, that's just what I wanted.  By the way, I found an interesting "gotcha" that can occur with expression arguments:

> x = 7
> z = 2
> mxy <- function( x = 4, y = x + z ) { return(x*y) }
> eval( formals( mxy )[[1]] )
[1] 4
> eval( formals( mxy )[[2]] )
[1] 9
> mxy()
[1] 24
> mxy( eval( formals( mxy )[[1]] ), eval( formals( mxy )[[2]] ) )
[1] 36
>

The problem is "confusion" about whether the "x" in the second argument expression refers to the first argument, or the environment variable.  When the function is evaluated, the argument value of x is used, but when the argument is evaluated (using eval and formals) the environment value of x is used.  This is a reasonable choice, and mixing up arguments and environment variables in a function definition probably should be considered bad programming.

Yes, that is what I was referring to. In fact my second example shows it can be
even worse than in your example since v is computed by f so you
can't get v's value without running f.

1. plot.zoo is passing the log= argument to the panel and in this case
panel=lines.  You can (a) ignore the warning, (b) use suppressWarnings
or (c) use a custom panel which excludes log:

lines2 <- function(...) { L <- list(...); L$log <- NULL; do.call(lines, L) }
z <- zoo(1:100)
plot(z, log = "y", panel = lines2)

2.  If you are using a single panel then try this:
plot(z, yaxt = "n")
axis(2, c(1, 10, 100))

Try using xyplot.zoo.  See:
  ?xyplot.zoo
for an example which specifically shows how to do it.

There is an example in the example section of ?plot.zoo .  That
example is for a multipanel plot but the same idea works for
a single panel plot -- in that case you don't have to define a panel
but can just use axis directly.

> The problem is "confusion" about whether the "x" in the second argument expression refers to the first argument, or the environment variable.  When the function is evaluated, the argument value of x is used, but when the argument is evaluated (using eval and formals) the environment value of x is used.  This is a reasonable choice, and mixing up arguments and environment variables in a function definition probably should be considered bad programming.

Yes, argument expressions are always evaluated in the evaluation frame 
of the function. Sometimes they even refer to quantities computed well 
into the evaluation of the function, like "p" in

 > anova.mlm
function (object, ..., test = c("Pillai", "Wilks", "Hotelling-Lawley",
    "Roy", "Spherical"), Sigma = diag(nrow = p), T = Thin.row(proj(M) -
    proj(X)), M = diag(nrow = p), X = ~0, idata = data.frame(index = 
seq_len(p)))
.....
        p <- ncol(SSD(object)$SSD)
.....

(p is the dimension of the covariance matrix, aka the number of columns 
in the response matrix. It makes no sense to pass it as a separate 
parameter, and obtaining it via extraction from "object" is kludgy and 
inefficient as it is needed three times.)

Another gotcha is if you modify a variable referred to in a default 
expression before using the expression.

The upshot is that you pretty much cannot in general figure out what the 
argument defaults will evaluate to without actually running the function.

There is more than one implemented, hence we can guess that there is no 
generally best one among these, i.e. it depends on your data what to use.

Which version of nlme? nlme is a contributed package that can be updated 
independently of R releases.

For sure you are not aware. And which version of nlme have you used in 2004?

Well, out error message is:

Error in apply(exprmat, 1, mouse.anova) : object "exprmat" not found


Guess why ... and re-read the posting guide, please.

How much memory is consumed in your workspace? If so, remove huge 
objects from your workspace
How big is upfmla? Are there factors in it? If so, how many levels? Then 
you can calculate the size of your design matrix.
64-bit is nice, but how much RAM is in your machine?

I guess you do not have really many observations in your dataset. Then 
it highly depends ion the cross validation sets which parameter is best. 
And therefore you get quite different results.

In order to get stable (I do not say "best") results, you could try some 
bootstrap with many replications or leave-one-out crossvalidation.

now it works again,

length gave the same resultat as 'numrows'=as.numeric(table(df$A)))

Try this:

Hello Ronggui Huang,

I am working with FreeBSD 8.0-CURRENT (i386) and R-2.6.1 (not built from 
ports). After loading version 0.99875-9 of lme4 and then executing the 
example

   library(lme4)
   example(lmer)

all works fine for me.

Assuming, that your R installation is correct (from math/R ?), you 
should consider to reinstall lme4 and its dependencies. It is possible 
that these package have been built on a prior version of R.

For installing the package 'Matrix' on FreeBSD you have to use
gmake instead of make. The following example will do it

setenv MAKE gmake
R CMD INSTALL Matrix_0.999375-3.tar.gz
unsetenv MAKE

If reinstalling packages not solves your problem, please try if 
reinstalling R does. (Under FreeBSD the R sources build and install 
fine, so there is no need to use the port at math/R ...)

Hope this helps,
Rainer

Dear Rainer,

Thanks for your suggestion.

The problem lies in the Matrix package. I installed it under R-2.5.0.
When I upgraded R to R-2.6.0, I didn't upgrade all the add-on
packages. I reinstall Matrix and lme4 packages, things are going fine.

Regards

Ronggui HUANG

Subject: [R] probability from different values
Message-ID: <429134.34206.qm@web34308.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

i'm new R user and i need some help:

i have two vectors (A and B) and i need create another vector (C) from the subtraction of A's values with the B's values. How can i estimate the probability of C's values if i have differents values combinations of A and B that can result in the same value? like 90 -20 = 70 and 91 - 21 = 70.

example:
B = {18      18    18     19      20      21      22      23      24      25      26      27   28....} 
A = {82     83     84     85      85     86       87     88       89      90      91     91    92 ....}

Considering C's values that were computed from different frequencies of the A and B, is it necessary any mathematical convolution to estimated the  probability more precisely?

Thanks a lot

Ricardo

If you do 

      sudo apt-get build-dep r-base

you get all build-dependencies automatically filled in by the system.

Subject: [R] how to remove paths from where library() looks for packages

Thanks, Henrique!  I'm not sure this will help since the paths are 
already unique.

This line in this particular installation of R 2.6.1 on my Ubuntu 7.10 
workstation reads:

R_LIBS=${R_LIBS-'/usr/local/lib/R/site-library:/usr/lib/R/site-library:/usr/lib/R/library'}

One question (for me, at least), is why did I start to get this warning 
message, to begin with?  I wasn't getting it with  an earlier version of R.

The warning I'm getting started to appear after I updated from 2.5.1 to 
2.6.1. I did this using the procedure described on:

http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/bin/linux/ubuntu/

I used Ubuntu's Synaptic Package Manager to install R initially on this 
particular machine, from what I can recall.  After updating to 2.6.1, 
the packages I had previously installed with 2.5.1 were in the directory 
/usr/local/lib/R/site-library.   When I now install additional packages 
in 2.6.1, they are installed to this directory, and not to 
/usr/lib/R/site-library, the directory library() gives warnings about.   
My hypothesis is that the default library configurations for the two 
versions were different for some reason.

Thanks, Henrique and Phil, for your help!

Cheers,

Lynd

Try this:

B = c(82,83,84,85,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,91,92)

Hello Ricardo,

another solution could be using package distr:

library(distr)
A <- c(18,18,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28)
DA <- DiscreteDistribution(A)
# maybe
# support(DA)
# plot (DA)

B <- c(82,83,84,85,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,91,92)
DB <- DiscreteDistribution(B)
# support(DB)
# plot(DB)

DC <- DB - DA# convolution with of DB with (-DA)
# support(DC)
# plot(DC)

hth,
Matthias

Subject: [R] Too many open files
Message-ID: <C3993560.443%markus@insightfromdata.com>

Dear all,
Did this problem that was posted in 2006 (see below) ever got fully resolved
?
I am encountering the exact same issue
; I have executed get.hist.quote() in a loop and now R not only refuses to
establish any further connections to yahoo, but, worse, it will not open any
files either. For example, I cannot even save my current workspace for that
reason.
I tried 
  closeAllConnections()
As well as 
  showConnections()
But I do not see any open connections.
Also, does get.hist.quote() not close its connection internally once it is
done ?

Any help would be immensely useful as I am quite stuck.
Thanks!

Markus

Inside your loop you need to close the connection object created by url().

for (i in 1:500) {

    con <- url(urls[i])
    ## ... stuff here ...
    close(con)
}

R only allows you to have a fixed number of open connections at one time,
and they do not get closed automatically when they go out of scope. These
commands may help make clear how things work...

Are there lots of missing values in the data? If so, my guess would be that
na.omit(h1) leaves you with no data. Have you checked this?

Hi,

I do have a file that has 500000 columns and 40 rows. I want to apply PCA on
that data and this is what I did

h1<-read.table("Ccode.txt", sep='\t', header=F) # reads the data from the
file Ccode.txt
 h2<-prcomp(na.omit(h1),center=T)
 
but I am getting the following error
 
"Error in svd(x, nu = 0) : 0 extent dimensions"


I appreciate if someone can help

Thanks

I agree with Wensui, if you have a low order ARIMA model it is possible

You probably have a missing value in every row.  But does PCA with 500000 
columns make sense: 4999961 of the PCs are constant and arbitrary?
It is possible you meant PC on the transpose (sometimes called Q-mode)

Most likely you have a mixed-up system, with some packages installed under 
an earlier version of R.  Please use update.packages(checkBuilt=TRUE) to 
fix this.  (The culprit is probably Matrix.)

Searching the archives just after the releases of R 2.6.0 will find
quite a few postings from people who had made the same mistake.

Subject: [R] Odd time conversion glitch
Message-ID: <185766.72287.qm@web60821.mail.yahoo.com>

Hello, all.

I ran across an odd problem while working in R 2.6.0. The command line text follows. Basically, I attempted to convert a character vector of length 13 (in a data frame with 13 rows) from a character representation of dates to a POSIX representation using strptime. strptime returned a vector of length 9, which appears to contain 13 values (!) in the appropriate format.

I can't find any way to convince the strptime output that it has 13 values . . . even though (for example) posixvector[1:13] returns 13 values, anothervectorof length13<-posixvector[1:13] produces a length mismatch error.

Can anyone help diagnose this, or work around it?

Many thanks,
~Pat Carroll.

Subject: [R] Running R from a CD on Windows?
Message-ID: <000c01c848c6$988a8b00$6400a8c0@DD4XFW31>

Greetings, R-ians:

Yes it's easy to run R from a CD: I copied my windows installation folder to
the CD, then copied my R working directory to the CD.

To run from the CD, I copy the working directory from the CD to the desktop,
and then create an R desktop icon that points to Rgui.exe on the CD, and
starts in the working directory folder I just copied to the desktop.

The problem is that to create the desktop R icon you need to know that
Rgui.exe is on the CD in the bin subfolder of the R-2.6.1 folder, which I
know but the person being introduced to R for the first time does not.  And
creating a desktop icon is busywork that some find annoying.  And then the
user needs to copy the basic working directory folder to the desktop, since
R needs to be able to write to it and writing to the CD can't work with a
write-once CD.  Alas, my uses just want to put the CD in the drive and have
the autorun facility take care all this:

1) If there isn't a folder named "R-project" on the desktop, copy the one on
the CD to the desktop.
2) Create a desktop icon for R that points to Rgui.exe on the CD.  The
installation must determine what drive is currently being accessed, since
"D:\R-2.6.1\bin\Rgui.exe" would only work if the CD was running from drive
D.
3) Have the icon Start in "desktop\R-project" which is legal if you create
the icon yourself, but apparently not legal to put on the CD since the
windows are erased and cannot be filled in if the icon is copied back from
the CD to the desktop.

Since the basic R installation on Windows can create a desktop icon, I know

There is a batch script, rgui.bat, in batchfiles, see home page at
batchfiles.googlecode.com, that will search the registry and a
few other places for R and start up R if it can find it.  It does
not search  CD's automatically but that would be simple to add.

Sounds like you want to write some VisualBasic script that sets up the 
link etc., started by the autorun.inf facility.
In any case, many virus and/or behavior checkers will shout when you 
implement things like that ... - and I have disabled auto-anything for 
CD/USB devices not only form security reasons.

Please read the posting guide and provide a simple reproducible example as
it asks you to. Very likely a loop is not even needed.

Hi,
I am trying a for loop from 1 to 100 by 1. However, if a condition does
not get met, I want to "throw away" that iteration. So if my loop is
for (i in 1:100)
and i is say, 25 and the condition is not met then I don't want i to go
up to 26.  Is there a way to do that? I can't seem to manually adjust i
because from what I understand, R creates 100 long vector and uses that
to "loops thru" and I'm not sure how to get at the index of that vector.
Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.

My first exposure to S was on an AT&T 3B2 (a 3B2/100,
I think), at the Auckland (Mt Albert) Applied Mathematics
Division Station of the NZ Dept of Scientific and Industrial
Research.  The AMD Head Office in Wellington had one
also.  There may have been one or more others; I cannot
remember. This would have been in 1983, maybe.

It was a superbly engineered machine, but the sofware
(System V, version 3.2) had its problems.  If you back
deleted too far along the command line, something
unpleasant (losing the line? or worse?) happened.
On typing 1+1 at the S command line, it took a second
to get an answer.

You're not being entirely clear. If you don't increment the loop 
counter, you generally get stuck in an infinite loop. That is, unless 
you rely on external input somehow, which you never told us about. You 
can easily do a while()-type loop in R, but whether that solves your 
problem is hard to tell.

Often the solution lies in whole-object thinking, and can end up quite 
different from index-fiddling, so it might help if you said what the 
actual problem is.

Is this the kind of effect you want?

 > x <- runif(10)
 > cbind(x, 1:10, cumsum(x < .7))
                x    
 [1,] 0.384165631  1 1
 [2,] 0.392715845  2 2
 [3,] 0.895936431  3 2
 [4,] 0.910242185  4 2
 [5,] 0.689987301  5 3
 [6,] 0.237071326  6 4

 [9,] 0.392034868  9 7
[10,] 0.655076045 10 8

If you insist on using a loop, you need to separate the loop control 
from the manipulation of i, as in (e.g.)

i <- 0
for (j in 1:10){
   i <- i + 1
   cat("initial i = ",i,"\n")
   x <- runif(1)
   if (x > 0.7){
      i <- i-1
   }   
   cat("second i = ",i,"\n")
}

Subject: [R] groupedData function not found
Message-ID: <BAY139-W10E5EF414B783C90B6749BC6540@phx.gbl>


Hello,
I'm trying to use the groupedData function and R is giving me the message: Error: can not find function "groupedData"
The code is coming from a textbook so I think it should be correct:

pigs<-data.frame(cbind(pig.time,pig.id,pig.wt))
pig.growth<-groupedData(pig.wt~pig.time|pig.id,data=pigs)

I have added the package "nlme" and to confirm that it was installed correctly I requested the list of functions included in the package (library(help=nlme)) and I do see groupData in the list.
I am using R 2.6.1 in Windows XP.

I'll appreciate your help.
Thanks,

Subject: [R] Conditionally incrementing a loop counter: Take 2
In-Reply-To: <477428CE.4000801@biostat.ku.dk>
Message-ID: <403593359CA56C4CAE1F8F4F00DCFE7D0CBECE20@MAILBE2.westat.com>

Since I didn't want the i to increment in the loop when the condition is not met, then in my example I wanted the loop to actually run 14 times instead of the 10 since I wanted 4 of the iterations to be thrown away, or ignored.  I still haven't been able to figure this out.  Going the "while" route doesn't seem to work for me either.


nums <- numeric(10)
i <- 1
garbage <- 0

while (i <= 10){
	x <- runif(1)
	cat("x = ",x,"\n")
	if (x < 0.1){
		nums[i] <- x
		i <- i + 1
	}
	else{
	        garbage <- garbage+1
	}    
cat("i = ",i,"garbage = ",garbage,"\n")
}

Is this the kind of effect you want?

 > x <- runif(10)
 > cbind(x, 1:10, cumsum(x < .7))
                x    
 [1,] 0.384165631  1 1
 [2,] 0.392715845  2 2
 [3,] 0.895936431  3 2
 [4,] 0.910242185  4 2
 [5,] 0.689987301  5 3
 [6,] 0.237071326  6 4
 [7,] 0.225032680  7 5

 [9,] 0.392034868  9 7
[10,] 0.655076045 10 8

If you insist on using a loop, you need to separate the loop control 
from the manipulation of i, as in (e.g.)

i <- 0
for (j in 1:10){
   i <- i + 1
   cat("initial i = ",i,"\n")
   x <- runif(1)
   if (x > 0.7){
      i <- i-1
   }   
   cat("second i = ",i,"\n")
}

I don't know wether I need to specify a training set and a testing set, I also don't know the error nor the classifier; shouldn't the lenght of class of var.can3 be 7 since  I only have 7 different classes?

	version)
Message-ID: <439173.59898.qm@web35604.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

(Apologies the previous version was sent as rich text)

Hello,
I'm new to R, but I've read the intro to R and successfully connected it to an instance of mysql.  I'm trying to perform multiple linear regression, but I'm having trouble using the lm function.  To start, I have read in a simply y matrix of values(dependent variable) and x matrix of independent variables.  It says both are data frames, but lm is giving me an error that my y variable is a list.

Any suggestions on how to do this?  It's not clear to me what the problem is as they're both data frames.  My actual problem will use a much wider matrix of coefficients, I've only included two for illustration.  

Additionally, I'd actually like to weight the observations.  How would I go about doing that?  I also have that as a separate column vector.

Thanks,
Aaron

tmp<-which(sas.def=="date")

sas.data[,tmp] <-

Hi,
   I just realized that in Matlab, as long as memory is pre-allocated, doing for-loop doesn't cost more time than doing things in vector form. 
   But it seems in R, it still cost a lot to do for-loop.  Is there any improvement in R that I missed. Thanks a lot. 

Merry Xmas Everyone !

while I move data between SAS and R all the time, personally I don't
think your recommendation is very practical. Instead, I feel SAS
transport file is much better than csv.

Plus, the sas dataset created on unix can't be opened by sas viewer on
windows. It is even undoable if the dataset is large.

Just my $0.02.

consider merging everything into a singe dataframe.  i haven't tried
it, but something like the following could work:

> reg.data <- cbind(margin, personcoeff)
> names(reg.data) <- c('margin', 'p1', 'p2')
> lm(margin~p1+p2, data = reg.data)

the idea here is that by specifying the data frame with the data
argument in lm, R looks for the columns of the names specified in the
formula.

for weights, see ?lm and look for the weights argument.

cheers,
tc

Mike,

A question about R from SAS Mecca ??? :-)

I would use Peter Dalgaard's suggestion of a 'while' type loop along with the 'next' loop control, something like this

i <- 1
iter_number <- 0
while(i<=10){
   iter_number <- iter_number + 1
   x <- runif(1)
   if (x > 0.7) next
   cat(iter_number, i, x, "\n")
   i <- i+1
}

Where iter_number allows you to print out loop number each time the condition is met (for instructional purposes only).  When the if condition is met, the next  construct skips back to the top of the while loop without executing the rest of the statements.

Hope this is helpful,

Dan

Exactly "what is the problem you are trying to solve"?  Could you
"provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code"?

A lot depends on what you are trying to do,  There might be other
ways, in R, than a 'for' loop to solve your problems.

My introduction to S was around 1984 on a 3B20 and VAX systems at Bell
Labs.  I still have a copy of the "brown" book written by Becker and
Chambers on the "S Interactive Language" (copyright 1984).  I remember
the "graphical" output on a daisy-wheel printer and using the HP
plotter that was connected in serial with the terminal you were using.
 When you wanted to plot, escape sequences were sent so the plotter
interpreted the output and plotted on paper that it moved back and
forth as the pens went horizontal.  It has changed a lot, but has also
stayed the same in a number of ways.

As I read it, it is the sequence of i's not the x's that are sought. The 
example suddenly skipped from something with x > .7 to something with x 
< .1, but it might be that Mike's while loop just needed to print i at 
the top of the loop rather than at the bottom. The result should 
(AFAICS) be equivalent to

 > rep(1:10, 1+rgeom(10, .7))
 [1]  1  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  8  9 10 10

HI,
   The question is meant to be a general one, I am trying to find out if there is new development in R that I might have missed. 

but here's a trivial example, 
       
To compute  y=sin(x) , x = 1,2,... 100000
 x=1:100000, 
1.  y =sin(x)
2.  for(i in 1:100000) y=sin(x[i])

1 is much faster than 2.  
Old Matlab also had this problem, but in new versions, 1 and 2 are mostly the same. 
I am just wondering if the same improvement has happened or will happen to R. 


Thanks .

I will venture a guess in that in the case of the 'for' loop, you are
calling 'sin' 100,000 times incurring the cost of individual function
calls at the interpreter level plus evaluating 'for' loop.  In the
vectorized case, you are only interpreting a single 'sin' call and
then internally evaluating the 'sin' function, which is a lot faster.
Also the results are different in the two cases.  In case 1) you get
100000 values back in 'y' and in 2) you only get the value of the last
loop through the 'for' loop.

R is typically optimized for vector type operations.

Tim (and others who responded privately),

Thanks for the help, this approach did work.  I have also reread ?lm a little more closely, I do see the weights functionality.

I have one last question: Now that I understand how to call this function and review the results, I want to extend it to my much larger real problem, with 100s of columns.  Is there a way to call the function in more of a matrix algebra syntax, where I would list the matrix(e.g. personcoeff) rather than the individual column names?  It seems like I might need to use lm.wfit, but per the help I'd rather use lm.

Thanks,
Aaron

consider merging everything into a singe dataframe.  i haven't tried
it, but something like the following could work:

> reg.data <- cbind(margin, personcoeff)
> names(reg.data) <- c('margin', 'p1', 'p2')
> lm(margin~p1+p2, data = reg.data)

the idea here is that by specifying the data frame with the data
argument in lm, R looks for the columns of the names specified in the
formula.

for weights, see ?lm and look for the weights argument.

Subject: [R] How to catch data from the different dataframes and lm problem?
Message-ID: <692075.69409.qm@web73608.mail.tp2.yahoo.com>



Dear all: 


I am a new R-user and I have 2 questions
about it.  


1) I have a dataframe.  Based on ?formulation? and ?subject?, a
dataframe is split into 4 dataframes.  The
example is as follows.  Moreover, I want
to calculate ?test? value for these 4 dataframes.  My question is that the ?test? values not
correct and I do not know where the problem is.




2) There are 12 ?test? (y) values from 1).  Then, I want to model the relationship
between ?concentration? (X) and ?test? (Y) by fitting the linear regression,
such lm(Y~X) and this is my target.  I
think that if I can catch ?test? (Y) values and ?concentration? (X) values into
a dataframe, then I can carry out regression.  So, how to catch all ?test? values from
different dataframes?  Or does anyone
have better way to get this target?


 


Example: 


w<-(c(1,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,2,2,2))


y<-(c(1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2))


z<-(c(1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3))


c<-(c(0.1,10,20,0.3,2.5,6,20,25,60,35,40,45))


df<-data.frame(formulation=y, subject=w,
time=z, concentration=c)


A.split<-split(df, list(df$formulation,
df$subject) )


 


for (j in 1:length(A.split)){


test <- 0


for(i in
2:length(A.split[[j]][["time"]])){


   
test[i] <- (A.split[[1]][["time"]][i] -
A.split[[1]][["time"]][i-1]) *
(A.split[[1]][["concentration"]][i] -
A.split[[1]][["concentration"]][i-1])* 0.5


   
test[i]<-test[i]+test[i-1]


 }


output<-data.frame(A.split[[j]][["subject"]],A.split[[j]][["formulation"]],A.split[[j]][["time"]],A.split[[j]][["concentration"]],test)


colnames(output)<-list("subject","formulation","time","concentration","test")


show(output) 


}


Best regards,
Hsin-Ya Lee

Hi Aaron,

if I understand your question correctly, you can use the "." in the  
formula, like so:

dat <- data.frame(x=1:10,y=rnorm(10),z=10:1)
lm(x~., data=dat)


The dot there stands for everything not already specified, so in this  
case that would be y and z (since x is already on the lhs). You can  
even omit things from . with the minus operator:

lm(x~.-y, data=dat)

This will do a regression of x on z only (and a constant of course).

You can see another approach in the examples section of the help  
entry on ?formula (I was led to that entry from reading the Details  
section of ?lm).

Subject: [R] warning on gamma option in par(args) or calling par(= new)?

You are calling par() *before* opening  and (in on.exit) *after* closing 
the pdf() device.  par() applies on a per-device basis, and if no device 
is open the default device will be opened.

As for why you get the warnings about 'gamma' and 'new', see ?par and read 
their entries.  Since you don't change any pars, I do not see why you are 
attempting to reset them.

What does the variable "test" represent?  It isn't clear from your code 
what it means.  (Currently it looks like a cumulative rate of change of 
concentration with respect to time; are you really sure you want this?)

Once you have all your "test" values, you probably want to perform a 
regression on all the data, in a single data frame, with "formulation" and 
"subject" as effects, e.g.
lm(test~concentration+formulation+subject, data=df)

If the subjects are drawn from a large population, it is better to 
represent them as random effects in a mixed effects model.
library(nlme)
lme(test~concentration+formulaion, data=df, random=~1|subject)

Hi Mike,
Is this what you want?

i<-1
while(i < 11) {
  if(runif(1) < 0.5) i<-i+1
  print(i)
}

This increments if the condition is met, doesn't if it is not met.

Hello,
I have the TCl/Tk command 
"tkmessageBox(titel="",message="x",icon="question",type="okcancel")" in my R 
script. Now I want to perform some operation in relation to the user's 
choice, something like
"if (okpressed) xxx else yyy"
What values does this command give and how are they used?
Thank you, Richard

Is it so hard to find out?

Your tcl documentation will tell you what tk_messageBox returns, and as it 
is tcl string, you need to call tclvalue() on the value of tkmessageBox()
to get an R character vector.

Why don't you test it yourself?

library(tcltk)
x <-  tkmessageBox(title="",message="x",icon="question",type="okcancel")
# press x or cancel
x
# <Tcl> ok or <Tcl> cancel

To get back from this Tcl-thing to an R-string, use

y <- tclvalue(x)

Message-ID: <20071228122036.91A5E594F1E@borg.st.net.au>

I was hoping for some advice regarding indexing,

 From a dataframe there are 27 variables of interest, with the prefix of "pre".

  [7] "Decision"  "MHCDate"   "pre01"     "pre01111"  "pre012"    "pre013"
[13] "pre02"     "pre02111"  "pre02114"  "pre0211"   "pre0212"   "pre029"
[19] "pre03a"    "pre0311"   "pre0312"   "pre03"     "pre04"     "pre05"
[25] "pre06"     "pre07"     "pre08"     "pre09"     "pre10"     "pre11"
[31] "pre12"     "pre13"     "pre14"     "pre15"     "pre16"

I want to combine these variables into new variables, using the 
following criteria :

(1) create a single variable PRE, when any of the 27 'pre' variables 
have a value >= '1'
(2) create a variable HOM, when any of the pre01, pre01111, pre012, 
pre013 variables have a value >= '1'
(3) create a variable ASS, when any of the pre02, pre02111, pre02114, 
pre0211, pre0212, pre029  variables have a value   >= '1'
(4) create a variable SEX, when any of the pre03a, pre0311, pre0312, 
pre03 variables have a value   >= '1'
(5) create a variable VIO, when any of the pre01 to pre06 variables 
have a value   >= '1'
(6) create a variable SERASS. If pre02111 or pre2114 >= '1', assign a 
value of 1, if there is a value of 1 or greater for pre0211 assign a 
value of 2; &  if there is a value of
1 or greater for pre0212: assign a value of 3;  if there is a value 
of 1 or greater for pre2029 assign a value of 4; everything else = 0. 
If a case has multiple values, 02111 prevails over 2114, 2114 
prevails over 0211, 0211 prevails over 0212; 0212 prevails over 2029.


I believe I can generate new variables (1) - (5) using code such 
as:  ASS <- (reoffend$pre02 | reoffend$pre02111 | reoffend$pre02114 | 
reoffend$pre0211 | reoffend$pre0212 | reoffend$pre029 >= '1')


I have three questions:

1. If this is correct, what is the most efficient way to generate (1) 
without having to type all the variable names. The following does not 
work: PRE <- reoffend [,9:35], >= '1'

2. I am unsure as to how to generate Example 6.

3. I wanted to exclude cases with a reoffend$Decision of value of 3, 
using the code below. However, I received a message saying there were 
NAs produced, however, the raw variable did not have NAs.

 > MHT.decision <- reoffend[reoffend$Decision >= '2',]
 > table(MHT.decision)
Error in vector("integer", length) : vector size cannot be NA
In addition: Warning messages:
1: NAs produced by integer overflow in: pd * (as.integer(cat) - 1L)
2: NAs produced by integer overflow in: pd * nl

 > table(reoffend$Decision)
    1    2    3
1136  445   66


Any assistance is much appreciated,

Bob Green

Try something like this (data frame simplified):
df <- data.frame(pre1=c(0,1,1,2),
                 pre2=c(0,0,1,0),
                 foo=c(0,0,1,3))
precols <- grep("pre", names(df))
gt1 <- function(x) x>=1
PRE <- apply(apply(df[,precols], 2, gt1), 1, any)


> 2. I am unsure as to how to generate Example 6.
SERASS <- rep(0, nrow(df))
SERASS[df$pre2029>=1] <- 4
SERASS[df$pre0212>=1] <- 3

I doubt that you want quotes around the '2' when defining MHT.decision.

Subject: [R] encoding question again
Message-ID: <005d01c84957$36654cd0$15b2a8c0@lifebook2>

 
Hi, 
I'm running the actual R version in JGR (version 1.5-8 ). 
Sys.getlocale(category = "LC_ALL") yields 
	[1] "LC_COLLATE=German_Germany.1252;LC_CTYPE=German_Germany.1252;LC_MONETARY=German_Germany.1252;LC_NUMERIC=C;LC_TIME=German_Germany.1252"

I want to write some HTML-Code enhanced by statistical results and labels encoded in Latin-1, which I pass to a function. Some label shall generate the filename. Although the labels are correctly handled in JGR they are somehow converted when they are written to the file. Also the filename is not constructed as wanted. The function definition is correctly sourced into R. The function is defined like this:

Itemtabelle.head <- function (abt ){
   # n?r z?m T?ST
   abt = iconv(abt,"UTF-8","LATIN1")   
   zz = file( paste("Itemtabelle/Itemtabelle", abt, ".html"), "wt", encoding = "LATIN1")
   cat(as.character("<html xmlns:o=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" xmlns:x=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:excel\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40\">  \n"),
       as.character("   <head>                                                                                                                                                \n"),
		.
		.
		.
       as.character("        <td colspan=5 class=xl28 width=727 style=\'width:545pt\'>Gesundheitsindikatoren:  "), abt, as.character("</td>                                   \n"),
       as.character("       </tr>                                                                                                                                               "), file = zz)
       close(zz)
       unlink(zz)
}
Setting abt as " ?rzte Innere, Gyn?kologie" and calling the function with this argument, yields a filename "Itemtabelle  ??rzte Innere, Gyn??kologie .html" and in the file a line 
         <td colspan=5 class=xl28 width=727 style='width:545pt'>Gesundheitsindikatoren:    ????rzte Innere, Gyn????kologie </td>  
is generated.                                 .
The problem remains the same in the rgui and rterm - except in rterm the resulting filename is "Itemtabelle ?rzte Innere, Gyn?kologie  .html".

Cheers,
Matthias

Subject: [R] logistic mixed effects models with lmer
Message-ID: <7b8a41740712280735u6e6a57f0tb640f37cbe987648@mail.gmail.com>

I have a question about some strange results I get when using lmer to
build a logistic mixed effects model.  I have a data set of about 30k
points, and I'm trying to do backwards selection to reduce the number
of fixed effects in my model.  I've got 3 crossed random effects and
about 20 or so fixed effects.  At a certain point, I get a model (m17)
where the fixed effects are like this (full output is at end of
message):

> print(m17, corr=F)
...
Fixed effects:
                       Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)
(Intercept)            -1.97887    0.19699 -10.045  < 2e-16 ***

poly(wfreq, 2)1      -119.72397   11.00516 -10.879  < 2e-16 ***
poly(wfreq, 2)2        17.35646    5.44456   3.188 0.001433 **
poly(wlen_p, 2)1      -13.60798    7.26926  -1.872 0.061208 .
poly(wlen_p, 2)2       -6.43167    5.24119  -1.227 0.219770
...

where poly(wlen_p,2)2 is the least significant factor left in the
model.  So I then build a model (m18) with exactly the same random and
fixed effects except removing poly(wlen_p,2)2.  Then I do an anova,
and I get:

> anova(m17,m18)
Data:
Models:
m18: is_err ~ sex + starts_turn + before_hes + after_hes + before_part +
m17:     after_part + first_rep + is_open + is_disc + poly(wfreq,
m18:     2) + wlen_p + poly(utt_rate, 2) + poly(dur, 2) + pmean +
m17:     poly(log_prange, 2) + poly(imean, 2) + poly(irange, 2) +
m18:     (1 | speaker) + (1 | corpus) + (1 | ref)
m17: is_err ~ sex + starts_turn + before_hes + after_hes + before_part +
m18:     after_part + first_rep + is_open + is_disc + poly(wfreq,
m17:     2) + poly(wlen_p, 2) + poly(utt_rate, 2) + poly(dur, 2) +
m18:     pmean + poly(log_prange, 2) + poly(imean, 2) + poly(irange,
m17:     2) + (1 | speaker) + (1 | corpus) + (1 | ref)
    Df    AIC    BIC logLik  Chisq Chi Df Pr(>Chisq)
m18 27  25928  26153 -12937
m17 28  25925  26159 -12934 5.2136      1    0.02241 *

So my first question is: Should I be concerned that the significance
level shown in the original m17 is so different from the one shown by
the anova?  It's hard for me to see how this could happen.  I noticed
that there is a post on the FAQ about significance levels in linear
mixed models, but I'm not sure whether it applies to the logistic
case and if so how.

Now, my second question is a result of removing one more factor
(is_disc) from the model, creating m19.  I do another anova:

> anova(m19,m18)
Data:
Models:
m19: is_err ~ sex + starts_turn + before_hes + after_hes + before_part +
m18:     after_part + first_rep + is_open + poly(wfreq, 2) + wlen_p +
m19:     poly(utt_rate, 2) + poly(dur, 2) + pmean + poly(log_prange,
m18:     2) + poly(imean, 2) + poly(irange, 2) + (1 | speaker) + (1 |
m19:     corpus) + (1 | ref)
m18: is_err ~ sex + starts_turn + before_hes + after_hes + before_part +
m19:     after_part + first_rep + is_open + is_disc + poly(wfreq,
m18:     2) + wlen_p + poly(utt_rate, 2) + poly(dur, 2) + pmean +
m19:     poly(log_prange, 2) + poly(imean, 2) + poly(irange, 2) +
m18:     (1 | speaker) + (1 | corpus) + (1 | ref)
    Df    AIC    BIC logLik Chisq Chi Df Pr(>Chisq)
m19 26  25925  26142 -12936
m18 27  25928  26153 -12937     0      1          1

and now it seems that m19 (which contains fewer parameters than m18)
is a better fit.  I don't see how it's possible to remove parameters
from a model and get a better likelihood, but I will confess that I
don't entirely understand how these kinds of models are estimated.
Does this have something to do with approximations that R is making to
fit the models, or numerical rounding errors?  Could either problem be
due to correlations among variables?  All my fixed effects are either
binary or numeric, and there are some fairly high correlations between
a few pairs of them (maybe as high as .6 or .65 using Kendall tau) but I
figured that this would be ok given the large number of data points.
I think each value of each binary feature is observed at least
70-100 times.

In case it matters, I'm running R 2.5.1 on Linux, with lme4 0.99875-8, and
below is a full printout of all my output:

> m17 <- lmer(is_err ~ sex + starts_turn + before_hes + after_hes + before_part + after_part + first_rep + is_open + is_disc + poly(wfreq,2) + poly(wlen_p,2) + poly(utt_rate,2) + poly(dur,2) + pmean + poly(log_prange,2) + poly(imean,2) + poly(irange,2)+(1|speaker)+(1|corpus)+(1|ref), x=T,y=T,family="binomial")

That's surprising.  I hoped that a "SAS Viewer" would read all formats 
of SAS binary files.

There is another definite limitation to SAS Viewer: SAS invested so 
little of their billions of $ into it that it only has 2 delimiters (tab 
and comma) and doesn't even check if character strings contain the 
delimiter so as to escape those occurrences.  So the Viewer often 
produces invalid csv files.

We have had that problem here, having received both 32 and 64 bit SAS
files from Linux and Solaris based SAS installations. The SAS System
Viewer was largely useless for the non-Windows SAS files that we have
had accessible to us, even though it will run quite nicely under Wine.

We have a 32 bit RHEL based SAS install here now, as I have noted in
prior posts. That has helped with certain aspects of SAS dataset
generation and transfer to and from clients.

DBMS/Copy, which also runs nicely under Wine, seems to be the only tool
that we have so far, that can provide for something of a universal SAS
"can opener". It will at least successfully _open_ SAS datasets
generated on a variety of platforms, when other approaches have failed.

However, as I have also noted in prior posts, the SAS datasets that
DBMS/Copy generates, are not guaranteed to be able to be opened by SAS
itself. Hence our need to install SAS here.

Theoretically, the .sas7bdat files are supposed to be cross-platform
compatible and I think Peter had commented on that in a prior thread on
this subject. However, hands on experience has suggested that this
expectation is not absolute.

I have had good success with Stat/Transfer (and its Windows version runs 
perfectly under Linux using wine) but haven't tested it as extensively 
as you've tested DBMS/Copy.

Hi list

How can I pause a loop (or any other function) for a defined time? E.g.

for(i in 1:5) {print(1:i); 'function to pause for 10 seconds'}

Thanks for help.

At least on Linux, see:

  ?Sys.sleep

Note the caveats regarding time resolution...

Subject: [R] unit attribute to list elements
Message-ID: <59FE4C0D-6FE2-4538-B801-F12D66C6C309@ex.ac.uk>

Hi,

I've started my own (first) package, part of which consists in  
listing common physical constants (Planck's constant, the speed of  
light in vacuum, etc). I'm wondering what would be a good way of  
dealing with pairs of value/unit.


> constants <- list( cel = 2.99792458e8 , #m/s
> Z0 = 376.730313461, #ohm
> eps0 = 8.854187817e-12,#F/m
> mu0 = 4*pi*1e-7,#N/A^2
> G = 6.67428e-11 # m^3 kg-1 s-2
> )


I thought I could include the unit in the names attribute of each  
element, as in :

> names(constants$cel)<- " speed of light in vacuum [m.s^-1]"


Writing this for every element is very redundant... Is there any way  
to access and set the name of each first level element of the list?

> namesFirstLevelElements(constants)<- c(" speed of light in vacuum  
> [m.s^-1]",
> "impedance of vacuum [some unit]",
> ...)


Quite possibly, I'm completely on the wring track;

- maybe such a package already exists

- a custom class or structure would be more appropriate? I don't  
really know how to deal with classes, though, and I'd like to keep  
the access to the constants' values as direct and generic as possible.

Many thanks in advance,

baptiste

It can happen that the significance levels reported by the different
tests will be different.  The test in the summary is based on a local
approximation to the conditional mean and assumes that the variances
of the random effects will not change substantially when fitting the
model with and without that term.  Did they?

One thing I noticed is your output (and thank you for including that)
is that it reports that corpus has only two levels.  Is that correct?
If so, I would not advise using a random effect for corpus.  It is
very difficult to estimate a variance from only two levels of a
factor.  I suggest using a fixed effect for corpus instead.

The difference could be due to approximations or due to poor
convergence.  For some models the Laplace approximation can be
generalized to a higher-order approximation, called adaptive
Gauss-Hermite quadrature (AGQ), but that isn't feasible when you have
crossed random effects (and, besides, I  still haven't written the
code for AGQ even in the case where you don't have crossed random
effects).

First I suggest that you check the value stored as the log-likelihood

dput(logLik(m17))
dput(logLik(m18))

to see how different they really are.

You could, if you are feeling brave, try the development version of
the lme4 package from http://r-forge.r-project.org.  To do that,
however, you will need to install a new version of R (R-2.6.1 is
preferred) and a new version of the Matrix package.  Then you can
install the new lme4 with

install.packages("lme4", repos = "http://r-forge.r-project.org")

If you prefer, you can contact me off-list and I can try to fit your
models for you using the development version.

Hi Andrea,

did you try

require(nlme)

?  Adding a package is not necessarily the same as loading it.

Cheers

Subject: [R] SAS to R - if you have SAS 8.2+
Message-ID: <381640.5627.qm@web36812.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi there,

the attached R function uses the SAS Integrated Object
Model (IOM) and it can deal with SAS dates and long
variable names. All you need to provide is the folder
where the SAS data file is and the data file name
without the extension. The function requires the rcom
package.

This is meant to be first cut...but improvements and
suggestions are more than welcome!

Gyula

 import.sas.data <-
function(inPath,inSAS,as.is=FALSE){
 # Function to read in a SAS data file
 # Packages needed: rcom
 # inPath: path to SAS file
 # inSAS: SAS data file name (no extension)
 # as.is: as per read.csv (FALSE - force all character
variables to be factors)
 # outputs a data.frame object
 # Created:  December 1, 2007
 # Modified: December 4, 2007
 # Author: Gyula Gulyas (gyula.gulyas at timberline.ca)
 # Use as is, no guarantees, liability due to data
loss is limited to the price you paid for this
function...
 
 require(rcom)

if needed

Dear Mike,

You could use a repeat loop and manage the index yourself:

i <- 0
repeat{
	x <- runif(1)
	if (x < .1){
	   i <- i + 1
	   cat("x = ", x, "\n")
	   }
    if (i == 10) break
    }

But if your example problem reflects your actual application, why not just
generate uniform random numbers on the interval (0, .1)?

I hope this helps,
 John

Message-ID: <101986.61022.qm@web56602.mail.re3.yahoo.com>

Hi all: The code below works well to print annotations
on base graphics but I can't make it work using the
ggplot2 package. I tried to use the capture.output
function but only prints the summary on the R console
and no on the graphic. Any ideas on how to print
output on ggplot2 graphs? For a powerpoint
presentation I basically just want to show viewers the
mean and Median on the graph since they won't be
seeing the data or the R console.
aa <- 1:10
plot(aa)
text(c(2,4),10, labels=c( "mean", "sd"),col=2)
text(c(2,4),9.5, labels=c(mean(aa), sd(aa)),col=4)
legend("topright",capture.output(sd(aa[1:2])))

m <- ggplot(movies, aes(x=rating))
m + geom_density()
capture.output(mean(movies[3]))

Hello,

maybe this info is helpful for someone else, at least it is a reminder 
for me if the problem should reoccur:

The last hours R drove me nuts because it wouldn't install new packages, 
or more irritating still: It would chose randomly which packages to 
install when given a list ("unable to move temporary installation" ). 
The solution was to turn of the indexation of folders.

  This almost deserves to be a FAQ, although it's a statistical rather than an R
issue:

http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/R/Rhelp02a/archive/46734.html
http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/R/Rhelp02a/archive/108660.html

  The one-sentence answer is that since probability *densities* can be >1,
log-likelihood *densities* can be >0 and hence negative log-likelihoods can be
<0 (so AIC/BIC can also be <0).  However, there's a potentially larger issue
with using AICs for mixed models, which is that it's not always entirely clear
what the right number of degrees of freedom is for a random effect ...

I have reset my windows and re-installed R (I explicitly asked for english)

I know I have an azerty french keyboard but even before the reset I had the
same azerty french
keyborad and the same XP settings and R was completely in english, now it's

Because glmod1 is of class "gls"

> class(glmod1)
[1] "gls"

so when you plot it you are invoking
plot.gls()

See the help for function plot.gls() in the nlme library.

> ?plot.gls

reports that the value of a call is

   Value

   a diagnostic Trellis plot.

so you are dealing with Trellis plots handled by the 
lattice package.  Trellis plots do not use
the par() settings used by regular plots.


Here's one way to do it.  (I substituted
an example from nlme since I don't have your
data and "upfmla" object.


library(nlme)

glmod1 <- gls(follicles ~ sin(2*pi*Time) + cos(2*pi*Time), Ovary,
           correlation = corAR1(form = ~ 1 | Mare))
summary(glmod1)

plot1 <- plot(glmod1, main="GLS Residuals vs. GLS Fitted")
plot2 <- qqnorm(glmod1)
print(plot1, split = c(1, 1, 1, 2), more = TRUE)
print(plot2, split = c(1, 2, 1, 2))



Try something like this.  The 'split' mechanism
works for me and I get both plots on one page.

Remember also that you can save the output of
trellis plot commands and print them later.  Trellis
plots do not always print right away - in many situations
you must explicitly wrap your trellis plot
command with print() before it will render on a
graphics device.


You can read more about putting multiple trellis plots on a
page in the help page for 
print.trellis 
in the lattice package.

Hope this helps.

After you master the lattice package
you can go to that New Years party
and celebrate!

See the rw-FAQ Q4.8.
It is not normal for the Windows' Indexing Service to cause any problems 
here, but enhanced versions can.

This is rw-FAQ Q3.2, Q3.4.

But the underlying problem is that Windows is telling R it is in French, 
and perhaps you need to sort that out.

Subject: [R] ASUS Eee R cookbook
Message-ID: <477625B7.8020201@bitwrit.com.au>

Hi all,
Having seen a few messages regarding the ASUS Eee PC (p701) and R, and 
then buying one and trying to get R installed on it, I thought there 
might be a few people on the list who would appreciate a cookbook on how 
to do it. It's a nice little piece of machinery, running Xandros 4 Linux 
(seems to be compatible with Debian Etch) and set up for the person who 
wants to do all those Webby things plus maybe a bit of office type work. 
All that works right out of the box. However, getting R going took me a 
few tries.

First get your Eee an internet connection. This was embarrassingly easy 
for me, I just plugged it into the D-Link router, clicked the LAN option 
and in a few seconds I was online. It also has wireless and even yer old 
bleep-buzz modem options.

You may be able to run R on the Easy Desktop, but I went straight to the 
Full Desktop (KDE). There is an excellent description of how to download 
the necessary files and enable KDE at:

http://wiki.eeeuser.com/howto:getkde

This gives you what most people who use Linux are used to (you can 
apparently enable GNOME, too). Now for the fun. I wasn't able to compile 
R from source as gcc wouldn't go. I'll let you know if I get it working.

As in setting up KDE, you have to add a repository.

1a. Applications|System|Synaptic Package Manager

OR

1b. Start a console, su to root and enter "synaptic"

2. Alt-S (Settings) | R (Repositories)

3. Alt-N (New)

4. Enter the URI of the repository, the distribution and the section(s)

This is where I ran afoul of the Debian voodoo. You don't actually enter 
the URI, just the bit before "dists" (I think). Then you enter the 
distribution (etch) and then "main". After many tries, my entry looks 
like this:

URI: ftp://ftp.au.debian.org/debian/
Distribution: etch
Section(s): main

while the actual URI is:

ftp://ftp.au.debian.org/debian/dists/etch/Contents-i386.gz

Maybe there is a better way. I'm happy to be corrected. The package 
listing will then download. When complete:

5. Scroll down to the "r-base" package, right click and select "Mark for 
Installation".

6. Click "Apply" near the top of the window.

7. Confirm in the dialog that appears and it should all happen.

At this point, I went off for lunch, as it looked like taking half an 
hour or so. The power pack on the Eee has those annoying half-shielded 
prongs and it had come loose at some point. When I returned, the Eee had 
shut down. Every time I powered it up, it would shut down again. I 
reverted to the factory settings using F9 on bootup (thereby losing all 
my upgrades) and it still kept shutting down, faster each time. I 
finally worked out that the battery had gone critically flat, recharged 
it, went through the whole process again and it works fine.

One thing that helps a lot is to resize the graphics window as the 
screen is kind of small. I tried:

x11(width=5,height=5)

and it didn't quite work, but then something I did (hit the wrong key? 
unintentionally clicked on something?) worked and it seemed to remember 
whatever I had done. Now my plots fit on the screen.

I have installed a few source packages, but until I get gcc to go, I 
will have to use synaptic to install anything that requires compilation. 
If I have made any gross mistakes or any of this doesn't appear to work, 
please let me know. I think it's absolutely fantastic to have R running 
on something that I can stick in a large pocket.

Jim

computers. The key was to realize that the number of processes should be 
one when launching Rgui using mpiexec and not the number of 
master+slaves, as I had first wrongly understood.

However, I seem to have a new problem which I have not been able to 
figure out:

After loading Rmpi, the first attempt to mpi.spawn.Rslaves() always 
spawns the slaves on the local machine instead of on both machines. If I 
close the slaves and spawn again, then one slave gets spawned on remote 
machine. Each time I close and then spawn againg, the order of machines 
is different, and eventually I get back to the situation where all 
slaves are on the local machine. Continuing to do spawning and closing 
seems to reveal a pattern. I can see similar behavior if I have more 
than two machines, and it takes more spawn-close cycles to get all my 
slave machines spawned on.

Below is an example session with two machines. This pattern shows 
everytime I start R and run this script. How to control the spawning so 
that I get everything right at the first call of mpi.spawn.Rslaves()?

Regards,

Samu

Subject: [R] another index question
Message-ID: <20071229123500.71F44595578@borg.st.net.au>


I am hoping for some advice regarding another index problem. The code 
below is intended to assign a value of 'V' if values on certain 
variables are >= 1, assign a value of 'N' if values on certain 
variables are >= 1  on other variables and assign a 'O' if values on 
any variable which have a value <= 0.

The outcome of this code is to assign a single 'O'. Clearly I have 
made a mistake somewhere.

pre_  <- new <- rep(0, nrow(reoffend))
 > pre_  <- new[reoffend$pre01111 | reoffend$pre012 | 
reoffend$pre013>= 1] <-'V'
 > pre_  <- new[reoffend$pre02111>=1 | reoffend$pre02114>=1 | 
reoffend$pre2029>=1 | reoffend$pre0212>=1 | reoffend$pre0211>=1]<- 'V'
 > pre_  <- new[reoffend$pre03a >=1 | reoffend$pre0311 >=1 | 
reoffend$pre0312 >=1| reoffend$pre03 >= 1] <- 'V'
 > pre_  <- new[reoffend$pre04>=1 | reoffend$pre05 >=1 | 
reoffend$pre06 >=1] <- 'V'
 > pre_  <- new[reoffend$pre07 >=1 | reoffend$pre08 >=1 | 
reoffend$pre09 >=1| reoffend$pre10 >= 1 |reoffend$pre11 >=1 | 
reoffend$pre12 >=1 | reoffend$pre13 >=1| reoffend$pre14 >= 1 
|reoffend$pre15 >=1| reoffend$pre16 >= 1 ] <- 'N'
 > pre_  <- new[reoffend$pre01111 | reoffend$pre012 | reoffend$pre013<=0] <-'O'
 > pre_  <- new[reoffend$pre02111<=0 | reoffend$pre02114<=0 | 
reoffend$pre2029<=0 | reoffend$pre0212<=0 | reoffend$pre0211 <=0] <-'O'
 > pre_  <- new[reoffend$pre03a | reoffend$pre0311 | reoffend$pre0312 
| reoffend$pre03<=0] <- 'O'
 > pre_  <- new[reoffend$pre04 | reoffend$pre05 | reoffend$pre06<=0] <- 'O'
 > pre_ <- new[reoffend$pre07| reoffend$pre08 | reoffend$pre09 | 
reoffend$pre10 |reoffend$pre11 | reoffend$pre12 | reoffend$pre13 | 
reoffend$pre14 |reoffend$pre15 | reoffend$pre16<= 0 ] <- 'O'

Secondly, once this is resolved I was hoping to change the prefix 
"pre_)" to "mhc_", repeat this code and join the pre_ and mhc_ 
variables - so the new variable would have values such as 'VO" or 
'NV' etc. I was hoping something like :  total <- c(pre_ , mhc_) 
would do this or am I misguided.

Any assistance is much appreciated,

Bob Green

First of all, your last statement:

 > pre_ <- new[reoffend$pre07| reoffend$pre08 | reoffend$pre09 |
reoffend$pre10 |reoffend$pre11 | reoffend$pre12 | reoffend$pre13 |
reoffend$pre14 |reoffend$pre15 | reoffend$pre16<= 0 ] <- 'O'

says that if any of the variables except pre16 are non-zero, the
result will be "O".  It is not saying is any of the variables are less
than or equal to zero; only the last one.  You probably want:

pre_ [reoffend$pre07 <= 0| reoffend$pre08 <= 0 | reoffend$pre09 <= 0 |
reoffend$pre10 <= 0 |reoffend$pre11  <= 0| reoffend$pre12 <= 0 |
reoffend$pre13 <= 0 |
reoffend$pre14 <= 0 |reoffend$pre15 <= 0 | reoffend$pre16<= 0] <- "O"

You really don't need 'new'.

I think you also have the same problem in:

> pre_  <- new[reoffend$pre01111 | reoffend$pre012 |
reoffend$pre013>= 1] <-'V'

pre01111 and pre012 only have to be non-zero to make the statement
TRUE. you probably want:

pre_[reoffend$pre01111 >=1 | reoffend$pre012 >=1|
reoffend$pre013>= 1] <-'V'

About a year ago I looked at running R (and the Rmetrics packages) on
an early UMPC Samsung Q2  with 512 GB of memory.  I ran R from a USB
flash memory drive and execution times were about twice that on my
current desktop PC with 2 GB memory and an Intel Core 2 Duo E6600
(2.4GHz).  I know that the relative results are probably specific to
the particular program that I was testing but they speak volumes for
the CPU in the Samsung Q2 which is the same as that in the Asus EEE
PC.  My desktop is running Windows XP Professional and the Samsung was
running the tablet version of Windows XP.

Given the small internal flash memory on the EEE PC I wonder if anyone
has tried to run R from an external flash drive in Linux.  Could one
expect as good a performance from the EEE PC as I got from the
Samsung.  (I also tried some TeX compilations from flash memory on the
Samsung with satisfactory results.  The Samsung  is about the same
size as the EEE PC but is a multiple of the cost.  I suspect that the
current price of the EEE PC will fall as soon as supply increases and
some other manufacturers enter the market. It would be great to be
able to have so portable a device that was capable of running R,
LaTeX, Octave, Mathematica etc, as well as open office and firefox.

Sorry... the function is qplot from ggplot2 package.

i checked the R's documentation and the problem was solved with a simple command to load the package and its dependencies: library(ggplot2)

Thanks

It's not easy on Linux!  There is a src/Makefile that ignores most of the 
info from how R was built, including CC, CFLAGS andlibrary pats such as 
/usr/local/lib64.  And that's if you can get dieharder built: it gave me 
lots of errors before succeeding.  I managed to build from the SRPM, but 
that installed with the include files without read permissions.

But I've succeeded on Windows, and RDieHarder is now in the CRANextras 
collection (and so can be installed from the menus etc). I'll send Dirk

Subject: [R] tcltk again
Message-ID: <200712291817.42974.r.mueller@oeko-sorpe.de>

Hello,
the admonition of Prof. Ripley to search the documentation to solve my problem 
helped, today I read a lot more on Tcl/Tk than before ;-)
But now I'm stuck again. With the help of my script some functions are plotted 
on the display, then I ask if the user wants to save it as pdf. In windows I 
use winDialog and it works. But I can't succeed in Linux. In short:
----------------------------------------------------
X11()
...
res <-    tkmessageBox(title="Beenden?", 
      message="Vor dem Beenden als PDF speichern?", 
      icon="question", type="okcancel")
if (tclvalue(res) == "ok")
...
-----------------------------------------------------
So far every thing is OK. Now I want a box the user should fill in the choosen 
filename (with a default)
and then
--------------------
pdf(filename)
...
--------------------
I experimented with tkgetSaveFile(). But in the moment the user gives the 
filename the file is not yet generated! And I can't generate it in advance, 
because the filename is not yet specified.
So I looked for a dialog box. [Some boxes are called "dialog boxes" though 
they only talk _to_ the user (besides the user's "yes" or "no")]. Just a 
simple box with a text field the user can type in and the value of this field 
given back.
One option was the "modal dialog", but I was not able to pick the essentials 
out of it. I did not want to press several buttons until the necessary window 
appears. Also the "editable text window" was not really a solution.
Perhaps a small hint again?
Richard

Thank you for your quick reply Prof. Ripley.
I thought I am modifying par() in par(mfrow = c(4,2)). This is not clear for 
me.
But I do understand now that par() applies to each device.
Thanks again.

I don't see what the problem is here.

fn <- tkgetSaveFile() allows you to select an existing file OR navigate to a directory and type in the name of a new file. In either case, you can feed tclvalue(fn) to pdf(). 

If you cancel the operation, then tclvalue(fn)=="", so test for that first.

I can't remember the exact details, but I do remember that the issue is 
discussed in

@ARTICLE{LMM:Vaida+Blanchard:2005,
   author = {Florin Vaida and Suzette Blanchard},
   title = {Conditional Akaike information for mixed-effects models},
   journal = {Biometrika},
   year = {2005},
   volume = {92},
   pages = {351?370},
   abstract = {This paper focuses on the Akaike information criterion,
               AIC, for linear mixed-effects models in the analysis of
               clustered data. We make the distinction between questions
               regarding the population and questions regarding the
               particular clusters in the data. We show that the AIC in
               current use is not appropriate for the focus on clusters,
               and we propose instead the conditional Akaike information
               and its corresponding criterion, the conditional AIC,
               cAIC. The penalty term in cAIC is related to the effective
               degrees of freedom p for a linear mixed model proposed by
               Hodges & Sargent (2001); p reflects an intermediate level
               of complexity between a fixed-effects model with no
               cluster effect and a corresponding model with fixed
               cluster effects. The cAIC is defined for both maximum
               likelihood and residual maximum likelihood estimation. A
               pharmacokinetics data application is used to illuminate
               the distinction between the two inference settings, and to
               illustrate the use of the conditional AIC in model
               selection.},

Subject: [R] non-ascii characters in TclTk
Message-ID: <00e201c84a92$c706a040$6400a8c0@DD4XFW31>

Greetings, R-Helpers:

A year ago or so I was able to use the non-ascii character ? in my TclTk.
(You can type it on Windows as <alt>0226)  I can use something like
expression(hat(a)) elsewhere in R, but I seem to be doing something wrong
when I try that syntax in TclTk.  The widget will run but it displays
something frightening like R-call_lang 019C8480 019A7724 where I expected to
see ?.

Can anyone suggest how to use the a with caret in a TclTk widget?

Thanks.

It would seem more natural to me if a date produced
the same format in an if and an ifelse function.
Moreover, as far as I can see the ifelse function
consists of hardly anything but two if functions.

Nothing frightening or unexpectable about that.... If you pass an 
expression, Tcl will think it is a callback. You shouldn't expect 
plotmath features to work outside of plots.

Can't you just type it in inside a string? Otherwise, Unicode escapes 
like "\u00e2" should do it.

Yep.

And, yes, it is annoying that ifelse() strips attributes, including 
class, but it is one of those things that have been in the S languages 
"forever", and nobody really wants to  mess with. The fundamental issue 
is that you need the result to be able to hold values from both of the 
"yes" and the "no" arguments and there is no guarantee that that is 
possible outside of the R base types.

You'd like to have things like these "work"

d <- as.Date(c("1994-3-4", "1996-3-1"))

ifelse(d > "1996-1-1", "1996-1-1", d)

ifelse(d <= "1996-1-1", d, "1996-1-1")

in the sense that the result is a Date object, but once you start 
thinking about the details of how it _might_ work, you find that things 
aren't all that simple. If there was a general mechanism for coercion 
between classes, then maybe it could be done, but there isn't any.

Thank you, Peter!

The Unicode sequence "\u00e2" for "?" is the ticket.  

While it is true that I can just use ? in my TclTk code, when I use
package.skeleton(name="unicode test"), the R code changes my unacceptable ?
to <e2> to indicate an error.  My code will still run, of course, but
doesn't display as expected (or does display as expected, depending on your
expectations).  ~:-)

Your Unicode suggestion fixes all that.  The package.skeleton() likes the
escape sequence and the resulting TclTk widget displays the ? as desired.

Thank you!

But wouldn't it be better/simpler to say that the yes and no arguments
should be of the same "type"? (I realise that this would be difficult
to enforce in R).  In what cases is it actually sensible/useful to
have different types in the yes and no arguments?

Wrt the dates, I have always wondered if it would be nice to have a
date primitive - e.g. in microsoft access sql, #1996-1-1# is a date
(vs "1996-1-1" the string).  (Although access uses your system dates
settings to determine whether #1/4/07# is 4 Jan or 1 Mar, which makes
portability a real pain)

Subject: [R] apply in zoo
Message-ID: <4777B221.7050706@yahoo.co.uk>

Hi R users,

could anyone guide me in the right direction reg. the column-wise 
application of a function on a zoo dataframe.

The tseries function sharpe() can only be applied to a univariate time 
series. Suppose you have merged the returns of two assets with 
get.hist.quote(), i.e.

set <- merge(log(ibm), log(ge))

is it possible to apply the function sharpe(), in this case with the 
argument

scale=sqrt(52)

since I am using weekly close prices

to the dataset "set" column per column?

I tried apply() with no result:

 > apply(set, 2, sharpe(set, scale=sqrt(52)))
Fehler in sharpe(zz) : x is not a vector or univariate time series

In the case of two securities, I could easily do it by hand, but for say 
100 or even 500, I am looking for an automated solution.


Many thanks in advance!

Bernd

1. Please read the last line on every message to r-help and in particular
the part about providing reproducible code when you post.

2. Your third argument to apply is wrong.  sharpe is a function but
sharpe(...whatever...) is not.  Suggest you carefully review the
examples on the ?apply page if the difference is not clear.

Subject: [R] Trying to install rjags on Mac OS X 10.5
Message-ID: <20071230162711.s4q4h4pkg04o8c84@webmail.manchester.ac.uk>

Greetings,

I wonder if anyone can offer any help or advice--even direction to an
appropriate source of advice. I am trying to install rjags 1.0.1 on Mac OS X
10.5 (see http://www-fis.iarc.fr/~martyn/software/jags/). I have R.app 2.6.1
installed.

JAGS 1.0.1 is apparently successfully installed. I (think I) know this because
when I type 'jags' into Terminal, I get the following:

Macintosh:Desktop ljs$ jags
Welcome to JAGS 1.0.1 on Thu Dec 27 20:56:09 2007
JAGS is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY
Loading module: basemod
Loading module: bugs
.

However, when I try to install rjags, I get the following problem.

Macintosh:Desktop ljs$ sudo R CMD INSTALL rjags_1.0.1-1.tar.gz
Password:
* Installing to library '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library'
* Installing *source* package 'rjags' ...
checking for pkg-config... /opt/local/bin/pkg-config
checking pkg-config is at least version 0.9.0... yes
checking for JAGS... configure: error: Package requirements (jags = 1.0.1) were
not met:

No package 'jags' found

Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
installed software in a non-standard prefix.

ERROR: configuration failed for package 'rjags'
** Removing '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/rjags'

I am really not sure what the problem is. I have (I think) set the proper
environment variables correctly. See below:

Macintosh:Desktop ljs$ which jags
/usr/local/bin/jags
Macintosh:Desktop ljs$ echo $PKG_CONFIG_PATH
/usr/local/bin

I should say that I had many other problems
along the way--gfortran not originally installed properly, R CMD INSTALL
couldn't find pkg-config. However, the above description shows the problems
remaining even after I have done a little homework.

Best wishes,

Lindsay Stirton

Thank you, Charilaos, for your posting.
I wrote the following:
--------------------------------------------------
require(tcltk)
#Tcl/Tk - Texteingabe
Datei <- tkgetSaveFile(initialdir="temp/",defaultextension=".pdf",
initialfile="Haupt_Chl_ Phaeo.pdf")
fileName <- tclvalue(Datei)
pdf(fileName) # graphical device driver with filename
...(code for the graphics)...
---------------------------------------------------
As expected, I get an empty pdf-file. Specifying the pdf-device-driver results 
in automatically saving the generated pdf. The tkGetSave-function isn't 
helpful in this case. I must have the possibility to input a filename and 
then give this filename as an argument to the device-driver.

is unlikely to be correct.  A typical Linux setting is

PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib64/pkgconfig:/usr/lib64/pkgconfig

and on my Mac the pkg-config files are in /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig and 
/usr/lib/pkgconfig.  Most likely it would work if PKG_CONFIG_PATH is not 
set, so try that first.

Oops, I just sent the wrong mail. It should be the following one. Please 
delete my mail from 30.Dez. 17:51


Sorry, but I don't really understand the recommended method using the tk-Box 
"tkGetSaveFile".
I wrote the following code:
X11()
# some code to generate a plot on the screen omitted

res <-    tkmessageBox(title="Finish?", 
      message="save as PDF?", 
      icon="question", type="okcancel")

if (tclvalue(res) == "ok") 
    Datei <- tkgetSaveFile(initialdir="temp/",defaultextension=".pdf",
    initialfile="Haupt_Chl_Phaeo.pdf")
    dev.copy(pdf, tclvalue(Datei))
else graphics.off()
graphics.off()

In the moment I'm saving I dont have the pdf generated yet. If I put it the 
other way round:
dev.copy(pdf, tclvalue(Datei))
if (tclvalue(res) == "ok") 
    Datei <- tkgetSaveFile(initialdir="temp/",defaultextension=".pdf",
    initialfile="Haupt_Chl_Phaeo.pdf")
I don't have the filename specified when it is needed.
(But today I could finish the Windows versions at last, using WinDialog ;-)

You need to specify the arguments using their explicit names, namely:
	dev.copy(pdf,file=tclvaue(Datei))
And that should be followed by closing the pdf device (since dev.copy  
leaves the device open). So I would follow that by
	dev.off()

Subject: [R]  Bayesian Integration (stat question)
Message-ID: <14549095.post@talk.nabble.com>


This may be far-fetched:
In Bayesian analysis to find the marginal posterior distribution of a
parameter it requires integration out of the so-called nuisance parameters.
Is there in R (like an equivalent to the deriv function) but to find the
expression of the integration (or an anti-derivative)? Like for example I
want to integrate out mu in the normal distribution, I would introduce
(note:punctuation marks are made up):
integral(prod[i to n] 1/sqrt(2*pi*s^2)*exp(-(xi-mu)/2*s^2), dmu)
and it would give me:
1/(sqrt(n)*(2*pi*s^2)^((n-1)/2))*exp(-sum[i to n]((xi-xbar)^2)/2*s^2)
?

I am trying to refer to a variable name in a lm regression where the variable name is in another variable, but it does seem to work.  Here is an example:

y<-rnorm(10)
dat<-data.frame(x1=rnorm(10),x2=rnorm(10),x3=rnorm(10))
nam<-c('x1','x2','x3')
library(gtools)
com<-combinations(3,2,1:3)
mod<-lm(y~nam[com[1,1]],data=dat)

#error in model frame....:variable lengths differ().

I also get the error if i just refer to variable x1 as nam[1] in the lm. any suggestions.  I am trying to set up a for loop that will perform an all subsets regression and calculate the AIC for each.

Dear Rusers,
I would like to color different sections of a histogram different colors.
I have an example that was done by "brute force" given below.  Has anyone

Subject: [R] adding a function after package.skeleton()
Message-ID: <878BE177-8F3F-409F-B32B-6B4A7BDFA339@ex.ac.uk>

Dear R helpers,

I've successfully created a package 'constants' using package.skeleton 
() with one dataframe and a few functions. However, now that I want  
to add some functions and data to the package, I run into a problem.

I ran prompt(...) and moved + edited the resulting .Rd files as  
appropriate (I believe). The log file from RCMD check constants does  
indicate a few problems (full log below).

As far as I understand, the real problem would be on the lines:

> * checking R code for possible problems ... NOTE
> L2eV: no visible binding for global variable 'Constants'
> eV2L: no visible binding for global variable 'Constants'


These two functions use the dataframe "Constants", part of this package:

> `L2eV` <- function(lambda)
> {
> 	data("Constants")
> 	Constants$h*Constants$cel/Constants$ee/lambda ->eV
> 	eV
> 	}


and

> `eV2L` <- function(eV)
> {
> 	data("Constants")
> 	Constants$h*Constants$cel/Constants$ee/eV ->Lambda
> 	Lambda
> 	}


After searching the R archives about "no visible binding for global  
variable ", I added the quotes around "Constants" but it doesn't seem  
to help. What would be the correct way to use this data inside the  
package?

Best regards,

baptiste

There's probably a number of ways to go about it. The problem is that  
nam[1] is a string vector, while you want the underlying "symbol". In  
your case, I think the simplest solution would be:

frm <- formula(paste("y~",nam[1]))
mod<-lm(frm,data=dat)

This would also work:

frm <- bquote(y~.(var1), list(var1=as.name(nam[1])))
mod<-lm(frm,data=dat)

This however does have a possible sideeffect, as in the following:
frm <- bquote(y~.(var1), list(var1=as.name(nam[2])))
mod2 <- update(mod)

mod2 is now the model for x2, even though we didn't give it an  
explicit new formula (The old formula had kept the difference in frm.

You can probably avoid this by:
mod<-lm(bquote(y~.(var1), list(var1=as.name(nam[1]))),data=dat)

Though again the name of the formula is not very pretty. The best  
one, from the point of view of getting the correct call in lm,  
probably is:

eval(bquote(lm(y~.(var1), data=dat), list(var1=as.name(nam[1]))))

This does not answer your question but note that you can do this:

Yep.

And, yes, it is annoying that ifelse() strips attributes, including 
class, but it is one of those things that have been in the S languages 
"forever", and nobody really wants to  mess with. The fundamental issue  
is that you need the result to be able to hold values from both of the 
"yes" and the "no" arguments and there is no guarantee that that is 
possible outside of the R base types.

You'd like to have things like these "work"

d <- as.Date(c("1994-3-4", "1996-3-1"))

ifelse(d > "1996-1-1", "1996-1-1", d)

ifelse(d <= "1996-1-1", d, "1996-1-1")

in the sense that the result is a Date object, but once you start 
thinking about the details of how it _might_ work, you find that things  
aren't all that simple. If there was a general mechanism for coercion 
between classes, then maybe it could be done, but there isn't any.

Yacas and Ryacas does exactly what I want. Actually I had asked previously a

Hi all.

This is my first post in this forum. Finally I find a forum in the web about
R, although is not in my language. 

Now I'm working with Bootstrap CI. I'd like to know how I can calculate a
Bootstrap CI for any statistic, in particular, for Kurtosis Coeficient. I
have done the following code lines:

> library(boot)
> x=rnorm(20)
> kurtosis=function(x) (mean((x-mean(x))^4))/(sd(x)^4)
> z <- numeric(10000)
> for(i in 1:10000)
> z[i]=kurtosis(sample(x, replace=TRUE))
> boot.ci(z, conf = 0.95,type = c("norm","basic","perc","bca"))

But the output shows the next error:

Error en if (ncol(boot.out$t) < max(index)) { :

Subject: [R] Text over the plot and the margins
Message-ID: <alpine.LNX.1.00.0712301420290.13822@octet.ca>

Hi,

I am having problem to display text that goes start inside the 
plot but should go over the margins of the plot.

You can have an example of what I mean by looking at the graphs on this 
page:
http://ptaff.ca/soleil/?l1pays=Canada&l1etat=Qu%C3%A9bec&l1ville=Montr%C3%A9al&year=2007&month=12&day=30&l1cityname=Montr%C3%A9al%2C+Qu%C3%A9bec%2C+Canada&l1ltd=45&l1ltm=30&l1lts=0&l1ltx=N&l1lgd=73&l1lgm=34&l1lgs=47&l1lgx=W&l1tz=-5.0&l1dst=US&l2ltx=N&l2lgx=E&l2tz=0&lang=en_CA&go=Voir+le+graphe%21
or
http://tinyurl.com/3ykaha

The sunset and sunlight values near the bullets should be displayed but 
they are truncated in the middle.

For what I understand, the "text" method is used to write inside the plot 
area while the "mtext" is used to write in the margins, i.e. outsite the 
plot.

Is there a way to start writing in the plot area and to indicate that if 
the strings goes outside the area, it can continue to write there?

Thanks,

Miguel Tremblay

(No, it will not work.)

If you select the Bioconductor repository (from Packages -> Set 
Repositories) Rgraphviz will be found: it works for me.

If you need more help, please ask on the Bioconductor list (see the R 
posting guide).

Hi Ravi -- this is a Bioconductor package, so please ask on the
Bioconductor mailing list.

There is a windows binary available

http://bioconductor.org/packages/2.1/bioc/html/Rgraphviz.html

The best way to install this and all Bioconductor packages is

> source('http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R')
> biocLite('Rgraphviz')

You need to call boot() to create an object to pass to boot.ci().

There are lots of examples in the help pages and in the book that package 
'boot' supports. From the help:

Usage:

      boot.ci(boot.out, conf = 0.95, type = "all",
              index = 1:min(2,length(boot.out$t0)), var.t0 = NULL,
              var.t = NULL, t0 = NULL, t = NULL, L = NULL, h = function(t) t,
              hdot = function(t) rep(1,length(t)), hinv = function(t) t, ...)

Arguments:

boot.out: An object of class '"boot"' containing the output of a
           bootstrap calculation.

and try class(z) .

Hi,

Thanks for this tip, I'm always amazed at the number of clever  
functions built-in in R ?? just wish i could think of their name  
rather than reinventing the wheel.

However, I'm still stupidly stuck with this basic question: how  
should a function access data in its own package?

Hi Miguel,

Some sample code would help but I think xpd in ?par
may be what you're looking for however it probably
would be easier/better to set  the xlim values to give
more space on the right hand side of the graph or just
modify the text( at=) value to keep the numbers inside
the plot area.

Hi Lindsay,

Did have some difficulties as well, but got it to work using Xcode3.0,  
Apple's gcc4.2preview release and gfortran 4.2.1 from Simon's web  
site. This was on R-devel though, on a Mac Intel.

Can it find the jags executable say from your home directory? Have you  
tried 'make check' in the classic-bugs/vol1 or vol2 example dirs (in  
the Terminal)? That would indeed confirm jags is running fine.

For rjags, I am a bit worried about the /opt/... . Did you at some  
point install software from Fink or Darwin ports? Until I installed  
the above newer toolset, I had never been able to get rjags to work.

Of course you don't really need rjags, only coda. I have also  
installed the package 'arm' and the packages arm depends on (Matrix,  
lattice, lme4, R2WinBugs). If it would help I can send you a  
'template' dir for the line example that does not use rjags.

A dependency I ran into was coda v 13.1, as of a couple of days ago  
not available as a binary package,
but available as a source package on CRAN.

Subject: [R] plot multiple data sets on same axis
Message-ID: <477817A2.6080206@slamb.org>

I'm new to R and struggling to reproduce graphs I've made with gnuplot.
Example here:

    http://www.slamb.org/tmp/one-active.png

I have three different data sets plotted on the same axis. (I also have
a number of samples for each X value which I displayed with quartiles
rather than plotting every point; that will likely be the subject of my
next question.)

My attempts to do this in R: I've put the data into a frame with (x, y,
dataset) columns; dataset is a categorical variable. I can get a coplot
which sort of shows the information:

    attach(myframe)
    coplot(y ~ x | dataset)

but not on the same axis with a legend. I'd like to start by getting
that in a scatterplot form:

    # XXX: datasets hardcoded in here...
    # is split() supposed to do something similar to this?
    # or how do I get a list of datasets to feed into subset?
    myframe_a <- subset(myframe, dataset=='a')
    myframe_b <- subset(myframe, dataset=='b')
    ...

and then I can apparently plot one and add points from others to it:

    # XXX: more hardcoding...
    attach(myframe_a)
    plot(x, y, col='red')
    detach(myframe_a)
    attach(myframe_b)
    points(x, y, col='blue')
    detach(myframe_b)
    ...
    legend("topleft",
           legend=c("a", "b", ...),
           fill=c("red", "blue", ...))

but there are several things I don't like about this solution:

* there probably is an existing function which does this? I can't find it.

* obviously I don't want to duplicate code for each dataset. I'd rather
loop based on whatever datasets are in the frame, but I'm missing how to
do that here.

* points() appears to not alter xlim and ylim. Is there a convenient way
to autodetermine them based on all the points?

* I've hardcoded the colors. This is the sort of thing I'd rather leave
to an expert. (I.e. someone who has looked at colorblindness studies and
knows which colors are easiest to distinguish.)

Any ideas?

Cheers,
Scott

I'd like to be able to modify axlab in (C) below so that 'Inf'
is replaced by the infinity symbol.

y <- rnorm(40)
breaks <- c(-Inf, -1, 1, Inf)
x <- cut(y, breaks=breaks)
plot(unclass(x), y, xaxt="n", xlab="")

## A: The following gives the axis labels "(-Inf, 1]", etc.
axis(1, at=1:3, labels=expression("(-Inf,-1]", "(-1,1]", "(1, Inf]"))

## B: The following replaces Inf by the infinity symbol
axis(1, at=1:3, labels=expression("(" * -infinity * ", " * -1 * "]",
                                 "(" * -1 * ", 1]", "(1, " * infinity  
* "]"),
    line=1.25, lty=0)

## C: The following gives the axis labels "(-Inf, 1]", etc.,
## in a more automated manner.
axlab <- lapply(levels(x), function(x)substitute(a, list(a=x)))
# Can alternatively use bquote()
axis(1, at=1:3, labels=as.expression(axlab), line=2.25, lty=0)

However I have been unable to modify axlab so that the infinity
symbol appears in place of 'Inf'.  Is there is some relatively
straightforward way to do this?  The issue is of course more
general than this specific example.

Thank you - that was exactly what I needed. I just discovered read.csv
understands URLs, so here it is with my actual data and formatting:

    df <- read.csv("http://www.slamb.org/tmp/one-active.csv")
    split.df <- split(df, df$method)
    plot(0, xlim=range(df$inactive), ylim=range(df$elapsed), type="n",
         ylab="time (?s)", xlab="inactive file descriptors", log="y",
         main="1 active descriptor, 1 write", bty="l")
    grid()
    for (i in seq_along(split.df)) {
        lines(split.df[[i]]$inactive, split.df[[i]]$elapsed, col=i)
    }
    legend("topleft", legend=labels(split.df),
           fill=seq_along(split.df), bty="n")

Next question. Rather than plot each point, I'd like to use boxplots to
show the interquartile range for each x.

I've tried replacing the for loop body with this:

    this_method <- split.df[[i]]
    boxplot(elapsed~inactive, data=this_method,
            add=TRUE, border=i, boxfill=i, outline=FALSE)

but it has two problems:

* it doesn't plot at the correct x values. It looks like I need to
supply a list of the x values as the "at" parameter, and I don't know
how to get unique values from this_method$inactive. (I tried the clunky
labels(split(this_method, this_method$inactive)), but it returns them as
strings.)

* it redraws the graph's frame, and it ignores bty="l" when doing so.

Not sure how to correct either.

Cheers,
Scott

Here's an idea, leaving some tinkering for you:

breaks <- c(-Inf, -1, 1, Inf)

zz <- lapply(breaks, function(x) 
      if(x==-Inf) quote(-infinity) else
      if (x==Inf) quote(infinity) else 
      format(x))

lbl <- mapply(function(x,y)
                 bquote("(" * .(x) * "," * .(y) * "]"),
              zz[-4], zz[-1], SIMPLIFY=FALSE)

Ahh. I missed the obvious answer - there's a function called unique.
at=unique(this_method$inactive) works.

also the x axis tics and labels...they're totally unreadable now.

I'm trying to fit a Cox proportional hazards model to some hospital 
admission data.  About 25% of the patients have had at least one 
admission, and of these, 40% have had two admissions within the 12 
month period of the study.  Each patients has had one of 4 
treatments, and one of the treatment groups has had no admissions for 
the period.  I used:

surv.obj<-Surv(time=time1,time2=time2,event=event,type="counting")
model<-coxph(surv.obj~Treatment+cluster(Subject))

and, as explained in the coxph help page, I get a warning message 
about convergence because the MLE of one of the coefficients is 
infinite since there are no admissions in one group.

I'm looking for suggestions about how to proceed with an analysis of 
these data.  I'd prefer not to ignore the fact that there are 
multiple admissions, but any alternative ideas I have at the moment do this.

Hi John,

I am on the slow side - can you provide sample code. How can one treatment
group have no admissions? 

Let's say there are treatments W, X, Y, Z. Do you mean that NONE of the
patients who got admitted the first time and, say, received treatment X
during the first admission, have ever had a second admission (in your data).
And for the other treatments W, Y, and Z some of those who got admitted the
first time came in a second time?

Cheers and a happy new year's eve,
Daniel

Hi Daniel,

Sorry, it may have been clearer if I had used 
"subjects" instead of "patients".  The treatments 
were administered to all subjects, and then in 
the succeeding 12 months, some were hospitalised 
and some were not.  Hence only about 25% of the subjects were hospitalised.

The start of the data:
subj    time1   time2   event Treat
1       0       6.2     1       A
1       6.2     12      0       A
2       0       12      0       A

so subject 1 was hospitalised at 6.2 months, subject 2 not at all.

Hope this makes it clearer.
Regards,
John

Does this give you want you want?  I assume that you have to also
ignore the first column in matrixC or else you don't have a reasonable

be.

Ahh. There is an "axis=FALSE" parameter to bxp, which boxplot passes
along. Thanks again, and sorry for all the list noise.

For the record, here's exactly what I did to duplicate the original graph:

df <- read.csv("http://www.slamb.org/tmp/one-active.csv")
png(filename="one-active.png", width=800, height=600)
split.df <- split(df, df$method)
plot(0, xlim=c(0, max(df$inactive)), ylim=range(df$elapsed),
     ylab="time (?s)", xlab="inactive file descriptors", log="y",
     main="1 active descriptor, 1 write", bty="n", type="n")
grid()
for (i in seq_along(split.df)) {
    this_method <- split.df[[i]]
    unique_inactive <- unique(this_method$inactive)
    boxplot(elapsed~inactive, data=this_method,
            at=unique_inactive, axes=FALSE,
            add=TRUE, border=i, boxfill=i, outline=FALSE, bty="l",
            whisklty="solid", staplelty="blank", medlty="blank",
            boxwex=max(unique_inactive)/length(unique_inactive)/2)
}

Subject: [R] Survival analysis with no events in one treatment  group
In-Reply-To: <6.2.3.4.2.20071231133536.02ebaba0@pop.ozemail.com.au>
Message-ID: <200712310504.CJA69507@md2.mail.umd.edu>

Hi John,

to me it still seems that you have two "problems", given your first email.
The first one, if I am correct, is that you have NO admissions in one of the
groups. That is, you have Treat A, B, C, D and for one of these treatments
there is not a single admission. Then you cannot estimate a survival
function for this group because nobody died (got hospitalized). I think you
have to exclude this group because your survival rate is 100% and your
hazard rate 0%. But more proficient people may have better advice with that.

That subject 2 did not get hospitalized is not a problem though. The
observation is censored at 12 months. Since there are more patients in his
treatment group (subject 1) who had an event, the survival function can be
estimated. 

To the multiple admissions problem: To account for the fact that some have
more than one event you may create a "number of events" variable, say
numEvents, and include that in a strata() argument to your regression call:

surv.obj<-Surv(time=time1,time2=time2,event=event,type="counting")
model<-coxph(surv.obj~Treatment+strata(numEvents))

Use strata if you think that your baseline hazard is different in the
different strata (in your case: if you think that the baseline hazard of
having an event differs with having had prior event(s)). At the same time
you assume that your treatment effect  - the beta on your Treat variable -
is the same across all strata. If you have reason to assume that the effect
of your treatment varies (interacts) with the number of prior events, then
it is not the correct approach. In addition you may include the
cluster(Subject) or frailty(Subject) commands.

Instead of strata you might also consider using a dummy variable, coding the
number of prior events (if the maximum number admissions per patient is
reasonably small and the number of cell frequencies reasonably large).

Finally, you may want to consult Terry Thernau and Patricia Grambsch's book
"Modeling survival data". It shows how to apply the techniques in R/S-Plus.
I find it invaluable.

Does that help you?

Daniel

Betreff: Re: AW: [R] Survival analysis with no events in one treatment group

Hi Daniel,

Sorry, it may have been clearer if I had used "subjects" instead of
"patients".  The treatments were administered to all subjects, and then in
the succeeding 12 months, some were hospitalised and some were not.  Hence
only about 25% of the subjects were hospitalised.

The start of the data:
subj    time1   time2   event Treat
1       0       6.2     1       A
1       6.2     12      0       A
2       0       12      0       A

so subject 1 was hospitalised at 6.2 months, subject 2 not at all.

Hope this makes it clearer.
Regards,
John

Joyful.

I'm adapting a FORTRAN 77 package for use with R.  Pretty
straightforward.  

Except for a glitch it took me some time to figure out.  This existing
package has subroutines which have parameters called "NA". So, I called
subroutines like

bnodes <- function(n, lst, lptr, lend, nodes, nb, na, nt)
{
  ensure.all.numeric(list(n, lst, lptr, lend, nodes, nb, n.a, nt), 
                     "all arguments to -bnodes- must be numeric")
  out <- .Fortran("bnodes", N=as.integer(n), LIST=as.integer(lst),
                  LPTR=as.integer(lptr), LEND=as.integer(lend),
NODES=as.integer(nodes),
                  NB=as.integer(nb), NA=as.integer(na),
NT=as.integer(nt))
  return(out[5:8])
}

I had called routines successfully before, so I couldn't figure out what
was wrong.  By elimination, I discovered that the parameter pass

    NA=as.integer(na)

was to blame.  So, thinking the right-hand-side (R's world) was the
problem, even if "na" wasn't recognized as "not available", I changed
to:

bnodes <- function(n, lst, lptr, lend, nodes, nb, n.a, nt)
{
  ensure.all.numeric(list(n, lst, lptr, lend, nodes, nb, n.a, nt), 
                     "all arguments to -bnodes- must be numeric")
  out <- .Fortran("bnodes", N=as.integer(n), LIST=as.integer(lst),
                  LPTR=as.integer(lptr), LEND=as.integer(lend),
NODES=as.integer(nodes),
                  NB=as.integer(nb), NA=as.integer(n.a),
NT=as.integer(nt))
  return(out[5:8])
}

No win.  I would only be happy if I used

bnodes <- function(n, lst, lptr, lend, nodes, nb, n.a, nt)
{
  ensure.all.numeric(list(n, lst, lptr, lend, nodes, nb, n.a, nt), 
                     "all arguments to -bnodes- must be numeric")
  out <- .Fortran("bnodes", N=as.integer(n), LIST=as.integer(lst),
                  LPTR=as.integer(lptr), LEND=as.integer(lend),
NODES=as.integer(nodes),
                  NB=as.integer(nb), NAA=as.integer(n.a),
NT=as.integer(nt))
  return(out[5:8])
}

and had to actually change the FORTRAN code to comply.

Sounds to me like there's a little room for improvement here.  Should be
documented anyway.

Dear Richie:

1) I have a mistake in the code that ?A.split[[1]][["time"]][i]? should
replace with ?A.split[[j]][["time"]][i]?.  The ?test? value is ?auc? which
is a cumulative rate of change of concentration with respect to time.  

for (j in 1:length(A.split)){
test <- 0
for(i in 2:length(A.split[[j]][["time"]])){
    test[i] <- (A.split[[j]][["time"]][i] - A.split[[j]][["time"]][i-1]) *
(A.split[[j]][["concentration"]][i] - A.split[[j]][["concentration"]][i-1])*
0.5
    test[i]<-test[i]+test[i-1]
 }
output<-data.frame(A.split[[j]][["subject"]],A.split[[j]][["formulation"]],A.split[[j]][["time"]],A.split[[j]][["concentration"]],test)
colnames(output)<-list("subject","formulation","time","concentration","test")
show(output) 
}

subject formulation time   concentration(X) test(Y)
1       1           1    1           0.1  0.00
2       1           1    2          10.0  4.95
3       1           1    3          20.0  9.95
  subject formulation time concentration(X) test(Y)
1       1           2    1            20  0.0
2       1           2    2            25  2.5
3       1           2    3            60  20.0
  subject formulation time concentration(X) test(Y)
1       2           1    1           0.3  0.00
2       2           1    2           2.5  1.10
3       2           1    3           6.0  2.85
  subject formulation time concentration(X) test(Y)
1       2           2    1            35  0.0
2       2           2    2            40  2.5
3       2           2    3            45  5.0

2) Then, I want to pool all "concentration" (X) and pool all "test" (Y) to
perform a 
regression.  For example, I used the ?regression? function of Microsoft
Excel 2003 and intercept is -0.01894 and X is 0.185758.  I think that if I
can catch ?test? (Y) values and ?concentration? (X) values into a dataframe,
then I can use ?lm? to fit linear models.  So, how to catch all ?test?
values from different dataframes?  Or what should I do? 

Best regards,

Hsin-Ya Lee

Dear all:

I used lm to perform a regression in R and and intercept is -0.01894 and X
is 0.185758.  This is my target.  
Y<-(c(0,4.95,9.95,0,2.5,20,0,1.1,2.85,0,2.5,5))
X<-(c(0.1,10,20,20,25,60,0.6,2.5,6,35,40,45))
lm(Y~X)
anova(wnlm<-lm( Y~X))
summary(wnlm<-lm( Y~X))

I catch test (Y) values and concentration (X) values by myself.  Then, here
is my question.  How to ?auto-catch? test (Y) values and concentration (X)
values from the split dataframes?  Because I think that if I can catch
?test? (Y) values and ?concentration? (X) values into a dataframe, then I
can use ?lm? to fit linear models.  So, how to catch all ?test? values from
different dataframes?  Or what should I do?

I had the same issue on my Mac. After install pkg-config from MacPorts
Martyn suggested to add the following 2 lines to my .bashrc file:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig"

Everything worked after that.

Best,

Vincent

Hi,

I need some instructoins about:

Given two larger vectors(A and B) with discrite time values, and considering that each vector was ordered previously.  how to compute the joint probability for each pair of values, considering the restriction that each element in A(Ai) is combined only with elements in B(Bi) that are lower than Ai? what is the more appropriate package/function to manipulate this kind of probability?

Thanks a lot

I fitted the following model:
dgr.lme2 <- lme(Average ~ poly(Time, 2) * Treatment, random = ~1|Replicate,
data = dgr, correlation = corAR1(), method = "ML")

I plotted the data in separate panels for each Treatment:
xyplot(Average ~ Time|Treatment, groups = Replicate, data = dgr, type =
c("p","l"), ylab = expression(paste(Delta, G)))

I would now like to overlay the population-level predictions from dgr.lme2
onto each Treatment-level panel.

How can I tell plot.augPred to do this? Or do I need a bespoke panel
function?
(plot.augPred gives panels for each Replicate by default)

Many thanks,

Do the argument names even get used on the Fortran side?? AFAIK, it only 
matters for labeling the result.

Anyways, this has nothing to do with "not available", a name like PACK 
would get you equally confused. You are being bitten by partial argument 
matching: NA matches NAOK. One workaround is to add NAOK=FALSE 
explicitly to the call. Or just use lowercase names.

You are assuming a bit much of your readers.

What exactly are you doing? Is it a value, a value label, or perhaps a 
variable name. How do the results of read.spss look on the R side? How 
did you apply iconv and utf8ToInt? What is your locale?

I mean, we could try and guess all those details, but you are the one 
with the hard info, and the motivation...

This _is_ Mac-specific, so please use R-sig-mac.

It looks like changing the time zone is changing the behaviour of the 
system function strptime.  But we need a reproducible example (see the 
footer of this and every message).  You can probably create one by 
debugging the failing call and seeing what string it is that fromchar() is 
trying to interpret (and if this is called from as.Date.character or 
as.POSIXlt).  If that's beyond you, you will need to make your file 
available to us.

Please post full details as requested in the posting guide and the 
requested example on R-sig-mac.

There is no such R version: that is the version of R.app.  Please see the 
posting guide for the information we do need.  I don't think this the 
devel version of R.

Thanks Rob,

Since I already had Xcode 3.0, I re-installed gfortran (from the R 
website, not
from the .dmg) and gcc4.2.1 preview. I am afraid the outcome was the 
same, i.e.
jags 1.0.1 not found.

Yes I do use Macports (and formery used Fink, which is still installed). What
issues does this raise? On your suggestion, I made sure that both were up to
date--still no success.

Your offer to send me a template directory to figure things out from is very
much appreciated. Yes please!

Lindsay

Depending on the ultimate need, you can also use the csv.get function in 
the Hmisc package.  csv.get keeps the original column names as variable 
labels, then transforms the names to become legal R names as with 
read.csv.  In the new version there is also an option to read the 
variable labels from another row.

The semantic gymnastics below aren't necessary (nor are necessarily they a
bad idea). This is basically FAQ 7.21. So, e.g.

z <- c("x1","x2")
mod <- lm(y ~ get(z[1]) + get(z[2]))

There's probably a number of ways to go about it. The problem is that  
nam[1] is a string vector, while you want the underlying "symbol". In  
your case, I think the simplest solution would be:

frm <- formula(paste("y~",nam[1]))
mod<-lm(frm,data=dat)

This would also work:

frm <- bquote(y~.(var1), list(var1=as.name(nam[1])))
mod<-lm(frm,data=dat)

This however does have a possible sideeffect, as in the following:
frm <- bquote(y~.(var1), list(var1=as.name(nam[2])))
mod2 <- update(mod)

mod2 is now the model for x2, even though we didn't give it an  
explicit new formula (The old formula had kept the difference in frm.

You can probably avoid this by:
mod<-lm(bquote(y~.(var1), list(var1=as.name(nam[1]))),data=dat)

Though again the name of the formula is not very pretty. The best  
one, from the point of view of getting the correct call in lm,  
probably is:

eval(bquote(lm(y~.(var1), data=dat), list(var1=as.name(nam[1]))))

Subject: [R] R to LaTeX Univariate Analysis
Message-ID: <47790994.2010006@u-paris10.fr>

Hi all

Well, first: happy new year...

Second: I write a function in R that might interest some other people. 
On the other hand, I am closer to beginners than experts; I don't know 
how valuable my code is. I don't know how long it will take to me to 
create a library and I don't know if it's worth to. So before starting 
this long process, I would like some advices, both on the interest it 
present, on the way of using it and on the inner R code...

My function is called "r2lUniv" for "R to LaTeX, Univariate analysis". 
Given a variable, it performs some basic analysis in R and generates 
LaTeX code to include in a document that print the analysis in a clean 
LaTeX way. The basic analysis depends of the variable type. 4 types are 
considered:
  - Nominal: modality, size, barplot
  - Ordinal: modality, size, quartile, barplot
  - Discrete: modality, size, mean, var, quartile, boxplot, barplot
  - Continuous: mean, var, quartile, boxplot, barplot

A generalization of r2lUniv deals with data.frame by runnig the basic 
analysis on every column. So to use it:
 > dataFrame <- read.csv("myData.csv")
 > r2lUniv(dataFrame,"fileOut.tex")

It performs the basic analysis and creates all graphs. Then I add 
\input{fileOut.tex} in my main.tex file.

My source file is available at: 
http://christophe.genolini.free.fr/r2lUniv/mySource/
It is definitely NOT a code ready for a library, there is probably bugs 
in it, all comments and all variables used for testing are in. But 
still, any advices will be welcome...

Christophe

PS: Does the  manual "Writing R Extensions" exists in French? Or 
anything equivalent?

Subject: [R] Survival analysis with no events in one treatment group
Message-ID: <200712311529.lBVFTHF27739@hsrnfs-101.mayo.edu>

John,
   The key issue with a data set that has no events in one group is that the 
usual Wald tests, i.e., beta/se(beta), do not work.  They is based on a Taylor 
series argument of the usual type: f(x) = f(x0) + a polynomial in (x-x0), and 
for infinite beta "x" and "x0" are so far apart that the approximation isn't 
even close.  The score and likelihood ratio statistics are just fine, however. 
So if you completely ignore any printout that involves the "infinite beta" 
columns of the estimated variance matrix all should be well.
   
   In your case, a second issue is that the likelihood ratio test is not valid 
for data sets with multiple events per subject. You have to account for the 
within subject correlation in some way, either by moving to a random effects 
model or a gee type variance.  You have done the latter by adding "cluster" to 
your coxph call.  Thus, only the "robust score test" line of your final output 
is reliable.  The LR test is tainted by multiple events, and the robust Wald by 
the infinite beta.  Use summary() to print all the test statistics.
   
  Assume you have variables x1 and x2 in a model, and want to test the 
importance of adding x3.  Stepwise regression programs often use score tests for 
this, but most users have never done it and don't know how. 
   	> fit1 <- coxph(Surv(time1, time2, event) ~ x1 + x2 + cluster(subject),
   		               subset= (!is.na(x3)))
   	> fit2 <- coxph(Surv(time1, time2, event) ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + 
   		              cluster(subject), init=c(coef(fit1), 0))
   		              
Now the "robust score test" in fit2 is a test of (coef1, coef2, 0) [no need for 
x3] vs the model with x3.  If you have no missing values you can skip the subset 
argument, but make sure that the two fits are actually on the same data set: 
always check that the "n=" part of the printout matches.

Hi, ZJ,
In verification package, there is a function that takes observed
response and predicted probability and then calculate the ROC.
I am not sure if it is what you are after.

Forming the ROC curve can lead to bad statistical practice, e.g., use of 
non-pre-specified cutpoints and use of cutpoints in general.  The area 
under the ROC curve is a valid measure of predictive discrimination 
though (even though it cannot be used to compare 2 models as it is not 
sensitive enough).  To get the ROC area you can use the simple somers2 
function in the Hmisc package.

Subject: [R] Different number of labels in different panels
Message-ID: <BFCE4071-0AA1-4E15-94B8-F411908E713D@web.de>

Hi,

I would like to put a number to each of the plotted curves in each  
panel. The problem is that there are different numbers of curves in  
different panels, so as you can see from the code below, I could put  
the correct numbers to the curves in the first panel, but for the  
second panel, both location and number of labels are incorrect (I  
would like to have "(1)" at location x=3.5, y=211 and of course no  
label "(2)" in the second panel). What is the correct way to solve  
this? I have a vector where the i-th entry specifies the number of  
curves in panel i, so I somehow have to bring this vector into play...

Thanks very much in advance.

    grps <- as.character(sort(unique(dataframe[subscripts,2])))
    draw.key(simpleKey(grps), TRUE, vp = viewport(0.15, 0.9))
}

The code below is the same as in your post except we have added
library(grid) and replaced the panel function with the above one:

library(lattice)
library(grid)
column1=c(1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2)
column2=c(1,1,1,2,2,2,1,1)
column3=c(1,2,3,1,2,3,4,5)
column4=c(111,112,113,121,122,123,211,212)
dataframe=data.frame(panelnumber=column1,curvenumber=column2,x=column3,y=column4)
xyplot(dataframe[,4]~dataframe[,3]|dataframe[,1],type="l",lty=1,groups=dataframe[,2],layout=c(2,1),aspect=1,
  panel=function(x,y,subscripts,...){
    panel.superpose(x, y, subscripts, ...)
    grps <- as.character(sort(unique(dataframe[subscripts,2])))
    draw.key(simpleKey(grps), TRUE, vp = viewport(0.15, 0.9))
  }
)

try this to get them to butt up against each other:

layout(rbind(1,2))
par(mar=c(0,4,3,2))
plot(rnorm(1:3),xaxt="n",xlab="")
par(mar=c(4,4,0,2))

A common legend is the usual approach, but take a look at

?panel.number

We cannot reproduce: We do not have "b.txt". See the posting guide.



>> dados1<-as.matrix(dados[,-1],nrows=30000,ncol=13,type=numeric)

Why do you specify nrows, ncol and type=numeric?


>> dados2<-as.vector(dados[,1])

Well, as.vector() strips attributes, particularly it removes the 
"factor" attributes!


>> model<-svm(scale=TRUE,type=C,dados[,-1],y=dados[,1],kernel=RBF)

type=C and kernel=RBF cannot make sense, I guess you mean

     model <- svm(x=dados[,-1], y=dados[,1], scale=TRUE,
                  type="C", kernel="RBF")

Same as before.

Please do read "An Introduction to R" - particularly on how to specify 
arguments in function calls before proceeding.

Subject: [R] Optimize jackknife code
Message-ID: <20071231180013.60620@gmx.net>

Hi, 

I have the following jackknife code which is much slower than my colleagues C code. Yet I like R very much and wonder how R experts would optimize this.

I think that the for (i in 1:N_B) part is bad because Rprof() said sum() is called very often but I have no idea how to optimize it.

 
#O <- read.table("foo.dat")$V1
O <- runif(100000);

k=100 # size of block to delete
      # the jacknife block has size N-k

total_sum=sum(O);

for (k in 1:2) {

    N_B = length(O) %/% k;
    N = N_B*k; # truncate data size to multiple of k
               # data beyond O[N] is not used

    #total_sum = sum(O[1:N]) # truncate data size N (which is a multiple of k)

    delete_block_sums = rep(0, N_B);
    for (i in 1:N_B)
    {
        # calculate indizes of the block boundaries
        a = 1+k*(i-1);
        b = k*i;

        # sum of block to delete
        delete_block_sums[i] = sum(O[a:b]);                      
    }

    v = (total_sum - delete_block_sums) / (N-k)

    # The Jackknife error is given by
    # eps^2 = (N_B-1)/N_B sum( (O_J - \bar{O})^2 )
    # I don't understand the prefactor 

    #c(k, (N_B-1)**2/N_B * var(v));
    print(c(k, total_sum/N, sqrt( (N_B-1)/N_B * sum( (v-mean(v))**2 )) ));
}

Subject: [R] Program output to file using a batch command file
Message-ID: <BAY111-F21746ADC992400F783466BD9500@phx.gbl>


If I copy the following commands in my batch file to the R console, R 
creates a file named "basicStatsIBM.lis" with the program output in it:

Sortie <- file(description = "basicStatsIBM.lis", open = "wt", blocking = 
TRUE,
     encoding = "UTF-8")
sink(file = Sortie, append = FALSE, type = "output", split = FALSE)
basicStats(ibm)
close(Sortie)

However, the same commands in a text file (named batch.txt, for instance) 
referred to from the R console by the command source("batch.txt") yields an 
empty "basicStatsIBM.lis" file.

Why the discrepancy in processing?
How to make the batch commands work as if the commands were pasted directly 
in the R console?
A solution to this problem would save time and aggravation to many people.  
Thank you.

To make the charts the same size, try setting the top and bottom
margins to be the same; e.g.,

layout(rbind(1,2))
par(mar=c(0,4,4,2))
plot(rnorm(1:3),xaxt="n",xlab="")
par(mar=c(4,4,0,2))
plot(rnorm(1:3))

Dear all,
  I have a data which is in text file and i would like to import the data to R. From the manual, i?ve found the read.table command function is the most appropriate but when i wrote the command an error had occur. It say ?Error in read.table"C:/Users/user/Documents/cfa-1.txt", header = T, sep = "\t",skip=10) :more columns than column names?. Please help me with this as i?m a first time user to R.
