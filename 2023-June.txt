I think your proposal of modifying plot.ts() to allow 'log' to be
vectorized would be the most natural solution here.

For what it's worth, the details of the implementation and the fact
that you can supply a panel function allows an ugly hack:

pfun <- function(...) {
    e <- parent.frame()
    e$log <- ""
    lines(...)
}
plot(DAX., log = "y", panel = pfun)

This would need to be modified to include a counter in more
complicated cases; we can do without because only the first panel has
a log scale in this example.

Well, as I am the maintainer of the *fracdiff* package,
I'm trying.  OTOH, as we will see below, you did not give us enough

Note that your error message pointed me to my (old, but still
fine) package {fracdiff} with its principal function fracdiff()
around which   arfima()  is a user-friendly and
generalization wrapper.

In other words arfima() calls fracdiff::fracdiff() and the error
happens there --- for you, but not for me, if I try to use the
same data as you.
I see that you must have found that too, because you mentioned
   View(environment(fracdiff)$.fdcov)

Maybe you need to

      update.packages()

{which should re-install R packages you have installed but which
 have become outdated in the mean time}

If the error persists, please send us the output of

1)
   dput(LYGH[[202]])

   so we get your exact data

2)
   sessionInfo()

   so we get much info about your R "setup"

.... last but not least:  If you are really calling arfima()
with a time series of length 4  (which your LYGH[[202]] above
seems to suggest)
then you really need to learn a bit about the tools you are
using: It really does not make any sense to fit a somewhat
sophisticated time-series model (or *any* time-series model, I'd say) 
to a "series" with 4 values.

Best regards,
Martin

R-experts,

I am trying to find the exact 95% confidence intervals of the mean (and the median) for the weibull distribution. Here below I have the exact 95% CIs of the meanlog and the median for a lognormal using EnvStats library (ready-to-run function in library) but I don't find how to get the exact 95% CIs of the mean and median for the weibull. Indeed, the ready-to-run function in EnvStats library is not available for weibull.

Any help would be appreciated.


#Exact 95% CIs for the meanlog lognormal distribution
library(EnvStats)
x=rlnorm(100000,0,1)
elnorm(x,method="mvue",ci=TRUE,ci.type="two-sided",ci.method="exact",conf.level=0.95)
?
#Exact 95% CIs for the median lognormal distribution

?

#Exact 95% CIs for the mean weibull distribution

Another suggestion:
     The statistics does not care where the numbers come from. The values 1, 2, 3 have a mean of 2 no matter if these are weights of a bird, plant heights, or concrete tensile strength. Your interpretation might change, but the mean is still 2.

Try synthetic data.
X<-rnorm(1000, mean=4, sd=2)
Y<-14+12*X
cor(X,Y)

That is too simple, but it is the start.
Y<- rnorm(1000, mean=14, sd=2) + 12*X
cor(X,Y)

look at the result in something like ggplot2
Dataf <- data.frame(X,Y)
ggplot(Dataf, aes(X, Y)) + geom.point() + stat_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE)


This approach has a few advantages:
1) I know that X and Y are samples from the Gaussian (Normal) distribution.
2) I know that the data are homoscedastic.
3) I can change 1 and 2 in whatever way I want. Possibly useful if you want to understand how violations in model assumptions influence outcomes.
4) I can look closely at the influence of sample size when assumptions are met and when they are not.

Note that ANOVA and regression do not assume that the independent or dependent variables are normally distributed. The assumption of Normality is for the error term in the model. However, if both dependent and independent variables are normally distributed then it is likely that the error term will also be normally distributed.

What should I get here?
Y<- rnorm(1000, mean=14, sd=2) + X*rnorm(1000, mean=12, sd=27)

Dear Martin,
                     REgrets to reply this late....

I am staring at a conundrum never before encountered in my experience with R:

LYGH[[201]]
[1] 45.40  3.25  6.50  2.15
> arfima(LYGH[[201]])
 Error in .fdcov(x, fdf$d, h, nar = nar, nma = nma, hess = hess, fdf.work = fdf$w) :

Well, as I am the maintainer of the *fracdiff* package,
I'm trying.  OTOH, as we will see below, you did not give us enough

Note that your error message pointed me to my (old, but still
fine) package {fracdiff} with its principal function fracdiff()
around which   arfima()  is a user-friendly and
generalization wrapper.

In other words arfima() calls fracdiff::fracdiff() and the error
happens there --- for you, but not for me, if I try to use the
same data as you.
I see that you must have found that too, because you mentioned
   View(environment(fracdiff)$.fdcov)

Maybe you need to

      update.packages()

{which should re-install R packages you have installed but which
 have become outdated in the mean time}

If the error persists, please send us the output of

1)
   dput(LYGH[[202]])

   so we get your exact data

2)
   sessionInfo()

   so we get much info about your R "setup"

.... last but not least:  If you are really calling arfima()
with a time series of length 4  (which your LYGH[[202]] above
seems to suggest)
then you really need to learn a bit about the tools you are
using: It really does not make any sense to fit a somewhat
sophisticated time-series model (or *any* time-series model, I'd say)
to a "series" with 4 values.

Best regards,
Martin

How do I add a numeric class to a data .frame. 

 

For example, I have calculated the following probabilities

 

           1            2            3

0.0011566127 0.0009267028 0.0081623324

 

How would I add them back into my data.frame for example

 

My_df <- data.frame(col_1 = c('A', 'B', 'C')) such that I end up with

 

col_1                   col_2

        A  0.0011566127

 

Though I could use a cbind.

The obvious answer is

My_df$col_2 <- prob_result

but whether that would work might depend on the structure of prob_result.

What does

dput(prob_result)

return?

Jeff R, it would be helpful if your intent was understood.

For example, did you want output as a column of labels c("A", "B", "C") and
another adjacent of c(0.0011566127, 0.0009267028, 0.0081623324) then you
could do:

data.frame(labels=c("A", "B", "C"), data=c(0.0011566127, 0.0009267028,
0.0081623324))
  labels         data
1      A 0.0011566127
2      B 0.0009267028
3      C 0.0081623324

If you wanted your columns labeled with the data in multiple columns, try
this:

> result <- data.frame(t(c(0.0011566127, 0.0009267028, 0.0081623324)))
> result
           X1           X2          X3
1 0.001156613 0.0009267028 0.008162332
> names(result) <- c("A", "B", "C")
> result
            A            B           C
1 0.001156613 0.0009267028 0.008162332

But these are not solutions to your specified problem unless you explain
properly what you want to do and the exact expected output.

Yes - I could have done that but I have over 5,000 calculated probabilities.
So yes a little more detail would have helped. I'm needing to add those
probability back into the original data.frame from which the model was
created as I'm going  to be using ggplot2 so I need the probabilities and
original dataframe to be one.

Jeff R, it would be helpful if your intent was understood.

For example, did you want output as a column of labels c("A", "B", "C") and
another adjacent of c(0.0011566127, 0.0009267028, 0.0081623324) then you
could do:

data.frame(labels=c("A", "B", "C"), data=c(0.0011566127, 0.0009267028,
0.0081623324))
  labels         data
1      A 0.0011566127
2      B 0.0009267028
3      C 0.0081623324

If you wanted your columns labeled with the data in multiple columns, try
this:

> result <- data.frame(t(c(0.0011566127, 0.0009267028, 0.0081623324))) 
> result
           X1           X2          X3
1 0.001156613 0.0009267028 0.008162332
> names(result) <- c("A", "B", "C")
> result
            A            B           C
1 0.001156613 0.0009267028 0.008162332

But these are not solutions to your specified problem unless you explain
properly what you want to do and the exact expected output.

How do I add a numeric class to a data .frame. 

 

For example, I have calculated the following probabilities

 

           1            2            3

0.0011566127 0.0009267028 0.0081623324

 

How would I add them back into my data.frame for example

 

My_df <- data.frame(col_1 = c('A', 'B', 'C')) such that I end up with

 

col_1                   col_2

        A  0.0011566127

 

Though I could use a cbind.

 

Jeff

Jeff,

The number of items is not relevant except insofar as your vector of
probabilities is in the same order as the other vector and the same length.

If for example you had a vector of test scores for 10,000 tests and you
calculated the probability in the data of having a 100, then the probability
of a 99 and so on, then you could make another vector of 10,000 giving the
probability of the corresponding entries.

So before calling ggplot, assuming you have two vectors called orig and
prob, you make a data.frame like

Df <- data.frame(orig=orig, prob=prob)

You use that in ggplot.

You can of course add additional columns. Or if your data is in another
format, do things like long to wide conversion and many other things.

If you already have a data.frame with one or more columns including orig,
you can attache the probabilities with something as simple as:

Df$prob = prob

If you are using ggplot, you may as well be using elements of the tidyverse
that provide a different take on how to do some things compared to base R
but that is not something easily discussed here.

Hmm... indeed, "conundrum" may be a euphemism for the
situation..... which clearly points to a bug *somewhere*.
As your dput() shows, the argument *is* a simple vector .. and
even if the default dput() may loose a few bits in
precison... you did show that with (possibly only almost)
identical argument, the error did not happen.

I really have no idea what's going on, ....
Some musing/ideas: the  NA/NaN/Inf  warning
may come from a memory corruption problem somewhere because some
of the involved packages using compiled code or the old version of R/lapack/??? 
or ??? cause it.

Does the error only happen occasionally?
If you "randomly" do a few calls of either
  arfima(c(45.4, 3.25, 6.5, 2.14999999999998))
or
  arfima(LYGH[[201]])
do you see "random" behavior? [if yes; this confirms typically
memory protection/allocation/... bugs]

fracdiff itself has also been updated (to 1.5-2) but that was really only
a compiler warning, not a bug fix, and I cannot imagine that
that makes the difference.

I think you should consider let your 'Windows Server' provider
update R on that server.  Notably the Windows version of R has
had problems fixed in the mean time ..
and at least there's a hope the problem disappears.

Lastly (but probably not helping more), you could use
dput() with control="digits"  and even
.Internal(inspect( * ))  magic on your  LYGH[[201]]

When I use simple numeric vectors "like" your LYGH[..], I get

> dput(c(45.4, 3.25, 6.5, 2.15), control="digits")
 c(45.399999999999999, 3.25, 6.5, 2.1499999999999999)

Subject: RE: [R] Adding a numeric class to a data.frame

Jeff,

The number of items is not relevant except insofar as your vector of
probabilities is in the same order as the other vector and the same length.

If for example you had a vector of test scores for 10,000 tests and you
calculated the probability in the data of having a 100, then the probability
of a 99 and so on, then you could make another vector of 10,000 giving the
probability of the corresponding entries.

So before calling ggplot, assuming you have two vectors called orig and
prob, you make a data.frame like

Df <- data.frame(orig=orig, prob=prob)

You use that in ggplot.

You can of course add additional columns. Or if your data is in another
format, do things like long to wide conversion and many other things.

If you already have a data.frame with one or more columns including orig,
you can attache the probabilities with something as simple as:

Df$prob = prob

If you are using ggplot, you may as well be using elements of the tidyverse
that provide a different take on how to do some things compared to base R
but that is not something easily discussed here.

Yes - I could have done that but I have over 5,000 calculated probabilities.
So yes a little more detail would have helped. I'm needing to add those
probability back into the original data.frame from which the model was
created as I'm going  to be using ggplot2 so I need the probabilities and
original dataframe to be one.

Jeff R, it would be helpful if your intent was understood.

For example, did you want output as a column of labels c("A", "B", "C") and
another adjacent of c(0.0011566127, 0.0009267028, 0.0081623324) then you
could do:

data.frame(labels=c("A", "B", "C"), data=c(0.0011566127, 0.0009267028,
0.0081623324))
  labels         data
1      A 0.0011566127
2      B 0.0009267028
3      C 0.0081623324

If you wanted your columns labeled with the data in multiple columns, try
this:

> result <- data.frame(t(c(0.0011566127, 0.0009267028, 0.0081623324))) 
> result
           X1           X2          X3
1 0.001156613 0.0009267028 0.008162332
> names(result) <- c("A", "B", "C")
> result
            A            B           C
1 0.001156613 0.0009267028 0.008162332

But these are not solutions to your specified problem unless you explain
properly what you want to do and the exact expected output.

R-Help Community

 

How do I add a numeric class to a data .frame. 

 

For example, I have calculated the following probabilities

 

           1            2            3

0.0011566127 0.0009267028 0.0081623324

 

How would I add them back into my data.frame for example

 

My_df <- data.frame(col_1 = c('A', 'B', 'C')) such that I end up with

 

col_1                   col_2

        A  0.0011566127

 

Though I could use a cbind.

 

Jeff

Dear Martin,
                     Sad that the bug is beyond your ken...

Fortunately, the error happens only rarely...The length of LYGH was 719 and there were only two such errors..I will just replace them with NA and make do.

By the by, what if I send LYGH as an attachment to your actual mail ( not the r-help mail)? Will it help? Can you then pinpoint the cause?

Or should I raise a bug report? If yes, how( I never raised one)?

THanking you,
Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

Hmm... indeed, "conundrum" may be a euphemism for the
situation..... which clearly points to a bug *somewhere*.
As your dput() shows, the argument *is* a simple vector .. and
even if the default dput() may loose a few bits in
precison... you did show that with (possibly only almost)
identical argument, the error did not happen.

I really have no idea what's going on, ....
Some musing/ideas: the  NA/NaN/Inf  warning
may come from a memory corruption problem somewhere because some
of the involved packages using compiled code or the old version of R/lapack/???
or ??? cause it.

Does the error only happen occasionally?
If you "randomly" do a few calls of either
  arfima(c(45.4, 3.25, 6.5, 2.14999999999998))
or
  arfima(LYGH[[201]])
do you see "random" behavior? [if yes; this confirms typically
memory protection/allocation/... bugs]

fracdiff itself has also been updated (to 1.5-2) but that was really only
a compiler warning, not a bug fix, and I cannot imagine that
that makes the difference.



had problems fixed in the mean time ..
and at least there's a hope the problem disappears.

Lastly (but probably not helping more), you could use
dput() with control="digits"  and even
.Internal(inspect( * ))  magic on your  LYGH[[201]]

When I use simple numeric vectors "like" your LYGH[..], I get

> dput(c(45.4, 3.25, 6.5, 2.15), control="digits")
 c(45.399999999999999, 3.25, 6.5, 2.1499999999999999)

Jeff,

I wish I could give you an answer to a very specific question.

You have lots of numbers in a vector representing whatever "probabilities"
mean something to you. There are currently no names associated with them.
And you want to make some kind of graph using ggplot.

So, to be quite clear, ggplot tends to like a data.frame or one of several
other such tabular constructs when making graphs, or have some data coerced
into such a format. BUT I am aghast at the concept of giving it a data.frame
with one row and thousands of un-named columns. First, the columns will have
semi-numerical names by default and second, they cannot be used by ggplot
unless you specify a name.

What you normally need is not lots of columns but lots of rows. One column
suffices for some purposes and multiple columns are often present for many
purposes. 

But what are you graphing as in probability versus what? Is that item
correlated with each result in some way? 

You eventually need to probably make a data.frame with two or more such
columns with names for the columns. You need to tell ggplot something like 

ggplot(mydata, aes(x=whatever, y=whatever, ...)) + geom_line(or whatever)
...

But as you release info this slowly, I think I will now drop out of this
conversation.

Good luck.

Subject: RE: [R] Adding a numeric class to a data.frame

Jeff,

The number of items is not relevant except insofar as your vector of
probabilities is in the same order as the other vector and the same length.

If for example you had a vector of test scores for 10,000 tests and you
calculated the probability in the data of having a 100, then the probability
of a 99 and so on, then you could make another vector of 10,000 giving the
probability of the corresponding entries.

So before calling ggplot, assuming you have two vectors called orig and
prob, you make a data.frame like

Df <- data.frame(orig=orig, prob=prob)

You use that in ggplot.

You can of course add additional columns. Or if your data is in another
format, do things like long to wide conversion and many other things.

If you already have a data.frame with one or more columns including orig,
you can attache the probabilities with something as simple as:

Df$prob = prob

If you are using ggplot, you may as well be using elements of the tidyverse
that provide a different take on how to do some things compared to base R
but that is not something easily discussed here.

Yes - I could have done that but I have over 5,000 calculated probabilities.
So yes a little more detail would have helped. I'm needing to add those
probability back into the original data.frame from which the model was
created as I'm going  to be using ggplot2 so I need the probabilities and

Jeff R, it would be helpful if your intent was understood.

another adjacent of c(0.0011566127, 0.0009267028, 0.0081623324) then you

data.frame(labels=c("A", "B", "C"), data=c(0.0011566127, 0.0009267028,

Subject: [R] Adding a numeric class to a data.frame

R-Help Community

 

How do I add a numeric class to a data .frame. 

 

For example, I have calculated the following probabilities

 

           1            2            3

0.0011566127 0.0009267028 0.0081623324

 

How would I add them back into my data.frame for example

 

My_df <- data.frame(col_1 = c('A', 'B', 'C')) such that I end up with

 

col_1                   col_2

        A  0.0011566127

 

Though I could use a cbind.

 

Jeff

Avi

I'm not sure why but neither the "cbind" nor "with" functions seemed to work
with the numeric object so I ended up converting the object to a numeric
vector

prob <- as.numeric(pred_probability)

then used the cbind function 

df <- cbind(train, prob); which seemed to work????

I do appreciate your time and assistance.

Subject: [R] Adding a numeric class to a data.frame

R-Help Community

 

How do I add a numeric class to a data .frame. 

 

For example, I have calculated the following probabilities

 

           1            2            3

0.0011566127 0.0009267028 0.0081623324

 

How would I add them back into my data.frame for example

 

My_df <- data.frame(col_1 = c('A', 'B', 'C')) such that I end up with

 

col_1                   col_2

        A  0.0011566127

 

Though I could use a cbind.

 

Jeff

Colleagues,

I am trying to create a 3D barplot using the following script

d <- read.table(text=' x?? y???? z
t1?? 5?? high
t1?? 2?? low
t1?? 4?? med
t2?? 8?? high
t2?? 1?? low
t2?? 3?? med
t3? 50?? high
t3? 12?? med
t3? 35?? low', header=TRUE)

library(latticeExtra)

cloud(y~x+z, d, panel.3d.cloud=panel.3dbars, col.facet='grey', 
????? xbase=0.4, ybase=0.4, scales=list(arrows=FALSE, col=1), 
????? par.settings = list(axis.line = list(col = "transparent")))

Executing this results in this error message

Error using packet 1
non-numeric argument to binary operator

I suspect that this error stems from read.table.

This graph is easily done with Excel but I'd rather use R

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks

Thomas Subia

the default levels for factor are alphabetic.  That is ok for d$x.

 Colleagues,
Thanks for the help!
Root cause of the problem was not to define z and x as factors!Now I know better.
All the best,

Subject: [R] Recommended ways to draw US Census map on Open Street Map base
 map?
References: <cb9f702b-6020-88f7-c387-97436d5f6f83@zembower.org>

Hello, all,

I asked a version of this question on the R-sig-geo list, but didn't get 
any response. I'm asking here in the hopes of a wider audience.

I'm trying to draw US Census map data, fetched with tigris, on top of a 
base map fetched by the package OpenStreetMap. I'm hoping for the most 
straight-forward solution. I made significant progress with leaflet(), 
but didn't need the interactivity of the map. I just need a 2D, static 
map that I can print and include in a document.

Here's some of what I've tried so far:
==========================================
library(tidyverse)
library(tigris)
options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)
library(OpenStreetMap)
library(ggplot2)

## Get an Open Street Map:
rw_map <- openmap(nw, se,
                   type = "osm",
                   mergeTiles = TRUE) %>%
     openproj(projection = "+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 
+no_defs")

## Get an example census map:
rw_tract <- tracts(state = "MD",
                     county = "Baltimore city",
                     year = "2020") %>%
     filter(NAME == "2711.01")

## This works:
autoplot.OpenStreetMap(rw_map)

## So does this:
plot(rw_tract$geometry)

## These don't:
autoplot.OpenStreetMap(rw_map) +
     geom_sf(rw_tract$geometry)

ggplot(map_data(rw_map), aes(long, lat))


ggplot(aes(x="long", y="lat")) +
     geom_sf(rw_map$geometry)
=====================================================

I think my problem in part is failing to fully understand the formats of 
the rw_map and rw_tract containers. rw_tract says it's a simple feature 
collection, but rw_map just gives me lists of the data.

Can anyone help nudge me along in getting my rw_tract to be drawn on my 
rw_map? Any advice or guidance on putting together map data from 
different sources?

And an over-arching question: Is moving in this direction, with ggplot2, 
the way you would recommend accomplishing this task? Is there a simpler, 
more straight-forward way of doing this?

Thanks in advance for your help and efforts.

-Kevin

As you are using Rstudio stuff(ggplot, tidyverse,etc.), you might try the
RStudio support site here <https://community.rstudio.com/> (note that they
have rebranded under the banner "posit.co").

However, I would have also thought the R-sig-geo list was the best place to
look for such help.

Cheers,

Hi Mohsin,
As I don't have your data, I had to fake it, so there are probably
some mistakes in the example below:

# my suggestion
x<-c(143,108,95,72,70,85,125,123,64,67,144,55,60,200,70,100,65,140,49,45,77,58,66,50,77)
y<-c(41,32,28,13,15,29,72,71,17,180,9,13,145,29,56,22,97,13,9,42,20,7,30,10,41)
labels<-c("sector","increase","period","foreign","compared","exchange","rate",
 "expected","impact","mpc","oil","sbp","growth","credit","economic","private",
 "year","government","improvement","months","average","cpi","real","net",
 "developments")
top25_df<-data.frame(x=x,y=y,labels=labels)
pyramid.plot(top25_df$x,top25_df$y,
 labels=top25_df$labels,
 main="Words Common in MPS statements",
 gap=40,
 unit="Count",
 top.labels=c("2016-20","Words","2021-23"),
 laxlab=seq(0,200,by=25),raxlab=seq(0,200,by=25))

To answer your question, I used the "laxlab" and "raxlab" arguments. I
also extended them to 0-200 to cover the range of the largest counts.
You can use 0-150 for both, but it is not a good idea to req I added
the unit="Count", which you can delete if you don't want it. I think
it's a good idea to let the viewer know what the units are. Apart from

Hi Mohsin,
I must  have hit the wrong key and sent the last email. The last
paragraph should read:

To answer your question, I used the "laxlab" and "raxlab" arguments. I
also extended them to 0-200 to cover the range of the largest counts.
You can use 0-150 for both, but it is not a good idea to request
different labels, as the plot won't be correct. I added
the unit="Count", which you can delete if you don't want it. I think
it's a good idea to let the viewer know what the units are.

I have also attached an image which didn't get into the last email.

Jim

Dear All,

I had done an automatic upgrade of my Debian 10  system which had also
upgraded R.

I reinstalled the stargazer package and the error went away.

Query : Do I need to reinstall all packages with each upgrade of R ?

Best,

Your session info says "stargazer 5.2.2".  What version do
you have now?  CRAN has 5.2.3. It seems likely to me that

  i) with R 4.3-0, certain warnings in the package have
     become errors (the NEWS file for R 4.3-0,
     https://cloud.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/NEWS.html ,
     has a prominent first item about using && and errors.)

and

 ii) the package maintainer fixed those warnings/errors in 5.2.3.

kind regards
    Enrico

Subject: [R] need help with plotmath and/or plotting unicode characters
Message-ID: <80B29117-3F79-4B55-9A13-B6EF1BFFFA52@plessthan.com>

R 4.2.3
OS X

Colleagues

This should be easy -- but not for me.

I want to plot text similar to this:
	N ? XX: YY

where XX can be either 1 or 50 and YY is an integer

I envision that there would be two solutions:

UNICODE: If I can generate "?" via unicode, the problem is solved:
	mtext(side=3, paste0("N ", UNICODE, " ", XX, ": ", YY))

PLOTMATH:
	mtext(side=3, bquote(N <= .(XX) ~":" ~ .(YY)))
This comes close:
	N ? 2 : 13
but I want to remove the space between the 2 and ":"

It should be possible to just copy & paste "?" in the R source code
nowadays. If for some reason the script has to stay ASCII-encoded, use
'\u2265'.

Use paste(.(XX), ":") or even just .(XX) * ":" to output them close
together.

Use * instead of ~

XX <- 5
YY <- 10
plot(1:10)
mtext(side=3, bquote(N <= .(XX) ~":" ~ .(YY)))
mtext(side=1, bquote(N <= .(XX) *":" * .(YY)))

well, that's not exactly what I tried to say
(and I did ask you for more output from your R session and
 also asked about what happens if you try things several time in
 a row, etc).

At the moment, it looks to me that nobody can reproduce the
problem with what you've given, and my personal guess is that
something is "bad" only on your computer, i.e., your combination
of hardware, software, your R installation, your installation of the forecast package
and its many dependencies (other R packages), etc.
..


    > Fortunately, the error happens only rarely...The length of LYGH was 719 and there were only two such errors..I will just replace them with NA and make do.

    > By the by, what if I send LYGH as an attachment to your actual mail ( not the r-help mail)? Will it help? Can you then pinpoint the cause?

Yes, please do that. Make the file "LYGH.rds" available (on the
web or send to me) which you get after

  saveRDS(LYGH, file="LYGH.rds")


    > Or should I raise a bug report? If yes, how( I never raised one)?

We don't know yet if there is any bug, see above.

Message-ID: <CAC8=1er380HDzSRtg5F3CvBzh-SVVZvsPrazUgLQ8Ba8STAfVQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have a small query.

Just like we have package leaps which can do variable selection for a
linear model, do we have any technique/software for variable selection
for panel data?

Here are the links to the mentioned packages:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaps/leaps.pdf
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plm/plm.pdf

Many thanks,
Ashim

Dear members,
                          I am using pbmcapply to parellise my code. But the following code doesn't work:

> LYG <- pbmclapply(LYGH,FUN = arfima,mc.cores = 2,mc.preschedule = FALSE)

It just hangs.

But the following works:

Any idea on why mc.preschedule = FALSE works after the one without it?

Dear members,
                         I think I have a hint:

The doc says:

mc.cleanup
             if set to TRUE then all children that have been forked by this function will be killed (by sending SIGTERM) before this function returns. Under normal circumstances mclapply waits for the children to deliver results, so this option usually has only effect when mclapply is interrupted. If set to FALSE then child processes are collected, but not forcefully terminated. As a special case this argument can be set to the number of the signal that should be used to kill the children instead of SIGTERM.
mc.allow.recursive

Unless true, calling mclapply in a child process will use the child and not fork again.

I think the child processes are not killed. I think I have to use one or both of the above arguments. Can you please shed some light on which one? ANd what goes on under the hood?
THanking you,Yours sincerely,AKSHAY M KULKARNI

My questions from the last time still stand:

0) What is your sessionInfo()? Maybe you're running a parallel BLAS
which doesn't always handle fork() or something. It may be worth
disabling BLAS-level parallelism as long as you're already trying to
use 100% of your processor by other means.

1) What does traceback() show after you interrupt pbmclapply? Most
likely, you would be interrupting selectChildren(), but if not, the
problem may lie in a very different place from what I'm expecting.

2) While pbmclapply is hung, without interrupting it, take a look at
the state of the system and the processes on it (are you still on RHEL?
use `top` or whatever task manager you're comfortable with).

 a) Is 100% of the CPU being used? 100% of one core? Is system mostly
 idle?

 b) Can you find the child processes launched by pbmclapply?

 c) Write down the PID of the child process and attach a debugger to
 it (If you're on RHEL, try following this guide:
 <https://beej.us/guide/bggdb/#attach>. If GDB asks you to install
 additional debug symbols by running debuginfo-install, follow its
 guidance and then restart GDB.) and obtain a backtrace. (In GDB, the
 command to obtain a backtrace is "backtrace".) Which function is the
 child process stuck in?

Ivan

Dear Ivan,
                  Thanks for the reply. I am pressurised by a fast approaching deadline and your reply calmed me...

Take a look at the following code:


debug at <tmp>#26: LYG <- mclapply(LYGH, FUN = arfima, mc.cores = 2, mc.preschedule = FALSE)
Browse[2]> length(LYGH)
[1] 357
Browse[2]>
^C

Browse[2]> LYG <- pbmclapply(LYGH,FUN = arfima,mc.cores = 2,mc.preschedule = FALSE)
  |                                                                                                                                                     |   0%, ETA NA

I am debuuging a function FUN wherein the above expressions appear. The pbmclapply code works well if called inside FUN:
> FUN(arg)
Result..

But as you may note, it doesn't work while in debug mode....

Also, if I replace pbmclapply by maclapply inside FUN, it hangs....

You might be interested in this:

[ec2-user at ip-172-31-15-116 ~]$ exit
logout
There are stopped jobs.

THis occurs when I close R and try to exit the shell prompt( I am on an AWS EC2 RHEL 8 Instance). Can this lead you somewhere? As of now I have quit R in my machine, so I can't get session info..but please let me know if you need it necessarily...

by the by, how do you run top when running R? I think at least in my machine, you have to quit R to get to the shell prompt...

I request you TO PLEASE reply to this mail as early as possible. I am facing an imminent deadline...please excuse my blatant violation of protocol, but deadlines are deadlines, right?

My questions from the last time still stand:

0) What is your sessionInfo()? Maybe you're running a parallel BLAS
which doesn't always handle fork() or something. It may be worth
disabling BLAS-level parallelism as long as you're already trying to
use 100% of your processor by other means.

1) What does traceback() show after you interrupt pbmclapply? Most
likely, you would be interrupting selectChildren(), but if not, the
problem may lie in a very different place from what I'm expecting.

2) While pbmclapply is hung, without interrupting it, take a look at
the state of the system and the processes on it (are you still on RHEL?
use `top` or whatever task manager you're comfortable with).

 a) Is 100% of the CPU being used? 100% of one core? Is system mostly
 idle?

 b) Can you find the child processes launched by pbmclapply?

 c) Write down the PID of the child process and attach a debugger to
 it (If you're on RHEL, try following this guide:
 <https://beej.us/guide/bggdb/#attach>. If GDB asks you to install
 additional debug symbols by running debuginfo-install, follow its
 guidance and then restart GDB.) and obtain a backtrace. (In GDB, the
 command to obtain a backtrace is "backtrace".) Which function is the
 child process stuck in?

Hi Akshay,
You do not have to quit R to run 'top'. You can have, for example, 2
windows, with R running in one and top running in the oher.

So if you interrupt the code _after_ it hangs at 0%, ETA NA, what's the
traceback? (We're doing this to confirm that the parent process hangs
in either selectChildren() or readChild().)

I guess this proves the existence of child processes, probably spawned
by mclapply, but why would they be _stopped_, I don't know. What's the
output of jobs -l at this point?

(This suggests trying to send them a SIGCONT and seeing what happens.
Does mclapply() get unstuck if you run the command killall -SIGCONT R
from a separate ssh connection? Would be strange if it worked, but
worth a try.)

Knowing the output of sessionInfo() could still be useful for solving
the problem. It's best to show the output after loading all the
packages, ideally just before you reproduce the problem.

> by the by, how do you run top when running R? I think at least in my

I can think of 3 options:

1) Type Ctrl+Z at the R prompt. R (and the rest of the process group, I
think) becomes suspended, you return to the command line prompt where
you can run other commands. At the system command line prompt, type
"fg" and press Enter in order to continue running R. (Press Enter a
second time so that R prints its command line prompt again.) This is
quick, doesn't require preparation, but messes up the state of the
processes you're interested in. (They become suspended instead of
running, which may complicate debugging.)

2) Open a second ssh connection to the same machine the same way you
had opened the first one. You won't be able to (easily) interact with
the R session running in the first connection, but you'll get a second
system command line where you'll be able to run top, gdb, and other
commands, which should let you inspect the state of the system.

3) Before starting R, install a "terminal multiplexer", that is, GNU
Screen or tmux. If you're still on RHEL, use sudo dnf install screen or
sudo dnf install tmux. One of these commands needs to be run once per
computer. Type the name of the program ("screen" or "tmux") to start it.
Inside screen/tmux, start R.

In Screen, use Ctrl+A then C in order to create a new virtual terminal;
Ctrl+A then type the number in order to switch between terminals. In
tmux, use Ctrl+B then C in order to create a new virtual terminal;
Ctrl+B then type the number in order to switch between them. Terminals
are numbered from 0 upwards, so the second one will be numbered 1, and
so on.

Dear Ivan,
                 here is the comprehensive info you requested:

THis is the output of top when I run a function LOWn() with mclapply in it. It executes succesfully. (the number of cores in my machine is 2)

> LOWn(OHLCDataEP[[63]])

This is the output of top when I run function LOWp() with mclapply also in it. it hangs:


top - 07:48:08 up 54 min,  2 users,  load average: 0.02, 0.36, 0.34

MiB Swap:      0.0 total,      0.0 free,      0.0 used.  11681.2 avail Mem

The mcalpply call only works the first time when I call it after starting an R session


TRaceback of after interrupting LOWp:

1: LOWp(OHLCDataEP[[63]])


I think child processes spawned by maclapply in FUN2 doesn't get killed...THis is from the top command AFTER interrupting FUN2 (sometimes there is only one R process)

 38615 ec2-user  20   0 1016432 400020  13392 S   0.0   2.5   0:02.05 R

THis is the output when FUN2 is running:
 1526 ec2-user  20   0 1525784 651628  23040 S   0.0   4.1   0:11.90 R

THis is AFTER succesful completion of FUN1:

Please note that PIDs are same between FUN1 and FUN2, and also that when I am not parallelising there is only one R process:

You had asked me to attach a debugger to the child processes. How do you get the child processes spawned by mclapply? For example, how do i identify, among the listed R processes above, the child processes?


Many thanks in advance....

Thanking you,

I see. The system is idle.

What are the warnings()?

...and the parent is stuck waiting for at least some of the children.
The problem must be inside the child processes.

If you start R like this:

OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 R

...and confirm that Sys.getenv('OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS') returns 1, then
try running your analysis, does it still get stuck?

There are reports complaining about OpenBLAS failing fork() tests when
built with OpenMP support, and this 'o' at the end of the shared
library name looks suspicious.

Make sure that there's only one R session running. Stray R processes
can be cleaned up by running killall R or rebooting the AWS virtual
machine.

Start R and run Sys.getpid(). This is the PID of the parent process.
Start your analysis and get it stuck. Do not interrupt the function,
let it keep waiting for the child process.

In a separate ssh connection or virtual terminal, run top. It should be
possible to type lowercase v to display a process tree, then navigate
it using arrow keys. Confirm that there is a parent R process with the
PID you saw above and a number of child processes branching from it with
different PIDs. If there's more than one child, try them both and see
if the results are different (hopefully not).

Run gdb and enter the following commands (substitute the value of the
PID for PID_OF_THE_CHILD_PROCESS):

attach PID_OF_THE_CHILD_PROCESS
thread apply all backtrace

If there's too much text and you can't copy it out of the terminal, use
the commands "set logging file gdb.log" and "set logging on", then get
the text output from the file "gdb.log" that will be created in the
current directory.

Dear Ivan,
                 I opened R with OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1
but am bootless....

The parent process id:  2745

Child processes:  3857  and  3858

...and the parent is stuck waiting for at least some of the children.
The problem must be inside the child processes.

If you start R like this:

OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 R

...and confirm that Sys.getenv('OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS') returns 1, then
try running your analysis, does it still get stuck?

There are reports complaining about OpenBLAS failing fork() tests when
built with OpenMP support, and this 'o' at the end of the shared
library name looks suspicious.

Make sure that there's only one R session running. Stray R processes
can be cleaned up by running killall R or rebooting the AWS virtual
machine.

Start R and run Sys.getpid(). This is the PID of the parent process.
Start your analysis and get it stuck. Do not interrupt the function,
let it keep waiting for the child process.

In a separate ssh connection or virtual terminal, run top. It should be
possible to type lowercase v to display a process tree, then navigate
it using arrow keys. Confirm that there is a parent R process with the
PID you saw above and a number of child processes branching from it with
different PIDs. If there's more than one child, try them both and see
if the results are different (hopefully not).

Run gdb and enter the following commands (substitute the value of the
PID for PID_OF_THE_CHILD_PROCESS):

attach PID_OF_THE_CHILD_PROCESS
thread apply all backtrace

If there's too much text and you can't copy it out of the terminal, use
the commands "set logging file gdb.log" and "set logging on", then get
the text output from the file "gdb.log" that will be created in the
current directory.

I'm afraid this is exactly OpenBLAS trying to use OpenMP and failing
because it currently breaks in programs that fork().

Related links are <https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/issues/294> and
<https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=60035>.

I was hoping that setting OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 would prevent OpenBLAS
from trying to use OpenMP, but that doesn't seem to work. If you
replace OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS with OMP_NUM_THREADS (in order to limit
the number on OpenMP side), does it also not work?

How did you install OpenBLAS on this machine? If my environment
variable adjustments don't work, you'll need to either replace OpenBLAS
with a different build (for example, one that uses pthreads instead of
OpenMP, or a pure single-thread build, since you're already using
mclapply), or even remove OpenBLAS altogether and replace it with a
different BLAS that is fork()-safe.

Dear Ivan,
                   What if I switch to Ubuntu?
I had a similar ( but not exactly the same) problem way back in 2018 and switching to Ubuntu solved it.

Thanking you,
Yours sincerely,
Akshay M Kulkarni

You shouldn't have to switch distros for problems like this one.

What you need to switch is your OpenBLAS build: instead of using
OpenBLAS built with OpenMP support (which isn't even the default
when compiling OpenBLAS), use OpenBLAS built with pthreads support. It's
also likely, but not 100% guaranteed, that setting OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
will avoid the issue by never starting any additional threads for
OpenBLAS purposes. At least some documentation says that
OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS is ignored on OpenMP builds of OpenBLAS, you
actually have to set OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 for it to take any effect.

I know very little about RHEL, but it seems that you already have a
pthreads build of OpenBLAS installed in
/usr/lib64/libopenblasp-r0.3.15.so; you just need to adjust the path to
the BLAS implementation used by R. If not, install the openblas-threads
package.

Can you use flexiblas
<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/fedora/#blaslapack-switching> to
switch the BLAS implementation to OPENBLAS-THREADS? This should be
possible by using the flexiblas R package or by setting environment
variables
<https://github.com/mpimd-csc/flexiblas#selecting-the-backend-at-runtime>.

That said, I know for sure that on Debian and Ubuntu you get a choice
between libopenblas0-openmp / libopenblas0-pthread /
libopenblas0-serial, and installing any one of these packages except
libopenblas0-openmp should avoid the problem. (And the thread limit
should be set to 1 if you're running your tasks in parallel by other
means.)

You shouldn't have to switch distros for problems like this one.

What you need to switch is your OpenBLAS build: instead of using
OpenBLAS built with OpenMP support (which isn't even the default
when compiling OpenBLAS), use OpenBLAS built with pthreads support. It's
also likely, but not 100% guaranteed, that setting OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
will avoid the issue by never starting any additional threads for
OpenBLAS purposes. At least some documentation says that
OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS is ignored on OpenMP builds of OpenBLAS, you
actually have to set OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 for it to take any effect.

I know very little about RHEL, but it seems that you already have a
pthreads build of OpenBLAS installed in
/usr/lib64/libopenblasp-r0.3.15.so; you just need to adjust the path to
the BLAS implementation used by R. If not, install the openblas-threads
package.

Can you use flexiblas
<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/fedora/#blaslapack-switching> to
switch the BLAS implementation to OPENBLAS-THREADS? This should be
possible by using the flexiblas R package or by setting environment
variables
<https://github.com/mpimd-csc/flexiblas#selecting-the-backend-at-runtime>.

That said, I know for sure that on Debian and Ubuntu you get a choice
between libopenblas0-openmp / libopenblas0-pthread /
libopenblas0-serial, and installing any one of these packages except
libopenblas0-openmp should avoid the problem. (And the thread limit
should be set to 1 if you're running your tasks in parallel by other
means.)

Sorry for the big delay of my report, but prolonged severe weather conditions often absorb a large amount of time and energies to my studies.

Thanks to all of you for your suggestions.

I have not been able to implement Bert Gunter's hint, his code gave me an error I have not been able to fix.

Bill Dunlap's hint is smart and has been resolutive.


Thank you again to all of you

Oggetto: Re: [R] aggregate wind direction data with wind speed required

I think that using complex numbers to represent the wind velocity makes this simpler.  You would need to write some simple conversion functions since wind directions are typically measured clockwise from north and the argument of a complex number is measured counterclockwise from east.  E.g.,

windToComplex <-
function(speed, degreesCW) {
  complex(mod=speed, arg=(90-degreesCW)/180*pi)
}
complexToWind <-
function(z) {
  # Convert complex velocity z to speed and direction (degrees clockwise
  # from north, in range [0,360)).
  stopifnot(is.complex(z))
  data.frame(speed = Mod(z), degreesCW = (pi - Arg(z*1i))/(2*pi)*360)
}

Then use FUN=mean instead of my_fun.

Dear list users,

I have to aggregate wind direction data (wd) using a function that requires also a second input variable, wind speed (ws).

This is the function that I need to use:


my_fun <- function(wd1, ws1){

  u_component <- -ws1*sin(2*pi*wd1/360)
  v_component <- -ws1*cos(2*pi*wd1/360)
  mean_u <- mean(u_component, na.rm=T)
  mean_v <- mean(v_component, na.rm=T)
  mean_wd <- (atan2(mean_u, mean_v) * 360/2/pi) + 180
  result <- mean_wd
  result
}

Does the aggregate function work only with functions with a single input variable (the one that I want to aggregate), or its use can be extended to functions with two input variables?

Here a simple example (which is meaningless, the important think is the concept behind it):
df <- data.frame(day=c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3), month=c(1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2), wd=c(45, 90, 90, 135, 180, 270, 270, 315), ws=c(7, 7, 8, 3, 2, 7, 14, 13))

aggregate(wd ~ day + month, data=df, FUN = my_fun)

cannot work, because ws is not taken into consideration.

I got lost. Any hint, any help?
I hope to have been able to explain my problem.
Thank you for your attention,
Stefano

Dear R users;
I am trying to fill a column based on a specific value in another column of
a dataframe, but it seems there is a problem with the codes!
The "Layer" and the "LU" are two different columns of the dataframe.
How can I fix this?
Sincerely


for (i in 1:nrow(data2$Layer)){
          if (data2$Layer == "Level 12") {
              data2$LU == "Park"

Hello,

There are two bugs in your code,

1) the index i is not used in the loop
2) the assignment operator is `<-`, not `==`


Here is the loop corrected.

for (i in 1:nrow(data2$Layer)){
   if (data2$Layer[i] == "Level 12") {
     data2$LU[i] <- "Park"
   }
}



But R is a vectorized language, the following two ways are the idiomac 
ways of doing what you want to do.



i <- data2$Layer == "Level 12"
data2$LU[i] <- "Park"

# equivalent one-liner
data2$LU[data2$Layer == "Level 12"] <- "Park"



If there are NA's in data2$Layer it's probably safer to use ?which() in 
the logical index, to have a numeric one.



i <- which(data2$Layer == "Level 12")
data2$LU[i] <- "Park"

# equivalent one-liner
data2$LU[which(data2$Layer == "Level 12")] <- "Park"


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Dear Rui;
Many thanks for your email. I used one of your codes,
"data2$LU[which(data2$Layer == "Level 12")] <- "Park"", and it works
correctly for me.
Actually I need to expand the codes so as to consider all "Levels" in the
"Layer" column. There are more than hundred levels in the Layer column.
If I use your provided code, I have to write it hundred of time as below:
data2$LU[which(data2$Layer == "Level 1")] <- "Park";
data2$LU[which(data2$Layer == "Level 2")] <- "Agri";
...
...
...
.
Is there any other way to expand the code in order to consider all of the
levels simultaneously? Like the below code:
data2$LU[which(data2$Layer == c("Level 1","Level 2", "Level 3", ...))] <-
c("Park", "Agri", "GS", ...)


Sincerely

Hello,

You don't need to repeat the same instruction 100+ times, there is a way 
of assigning all new LU values at the same time with match().
This assumes that you have the new values in a vector.


Values <- sort(unique(data2$Layer))
Names <- c("Park", "Agri", "GS")

i <- match(data2$Layer, Values)
data2$LU <- Names[i]


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Sorry, this is not clear. I mean


This assumes that you have the new values in a vector, the vector Names 
below. The vector of values to be matched is created from the data.

The problem being discussed is really a common operation that R handles
quite easily in many ways.

The code shown has way too many things that do not fit to make much sense
and is not written the way many R programmers would write it.

Loops like the one used are legal but not needed. 

As has been noted, use of "==" for assignment is the wrong choice. Not using
some method to refer to a specific cell  would still result in odd behavior.


One accepted and common method s to do this vectorized as you are dealing
with two vectors of the same size.

Code like:

Matches <- Data2$Layer == "Level 12"

Will result in a Boolean vector containing TRUE where it found a match,
FALSE otherwise.

Now you can use the above as a sort of indexing as in:

data2$LU[Matches] <- "Park"

Only the indexes marked TRUE will be selected and set to the new value.

Of course, the two lines can be combined as:

data2$LU[Data2$Layer == "Level 12"] <- "Park"

There are also alternatives where people use functions like ifelse() also in
base R.

And, of course, some people like alternate packages such as in the Tidyverse
where you might have used a mutate() or other methods.

Subject: [R] Problem with filling dataframe's column

Dear R users;
I am trying to fill a column based on a specific value in another column of
a dataframe, but it seems there is a problem with the codes!
The "Layer" and the "LU" are two different columns of the dataframe.
How can I fix this?
Sincerely


for (i in 1:nrow(data2$Layer)){
          if (data2$Layer == "Level 12") {
              data2$LU == "Park"
              }
          }

Hello,

Please cc the r-help list, R-Help is threaded and this can in the future 
be helpful to others.

You can combine several patters like this:


pat <- c("_esmdes|_Des Section|0")
grep(pat, data2$Layer)

or, programatically,


pat <- paste(c("_esmdes","_Des Section","0"), collapse = "|")


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Dear Rui;
Hi. I used your codes, but it seems it didn't work for me.

> pat <- c("_esmdes|_Des Section|0")
> dim(data2)
    [1]  281549      9
> grep(pat, data2$Layer)
> dim(data2)
    [1]  281549      9

What does grep function do? I expected the function to remove 3 rows of the
dataframe.
I do not know the reason.

Hi Javed,
grep returns the positions of the matches. See an example below.

> v <- c("abc", "bcd", "def")
> v
[1] "abc" "bcd" "def"
> grep("cd",v)
[1] 2
> w <- v[-grep("cd",v)]
> w
[1] "abc" "def"

Dear all;
I used these codes and I get what I wanted.
Sincerely

pat = c("Level 12","Level 22","0")
data3 = data2[-which(data2$Layer == pat),]
dim(data2)
[1] 281549      9
dim(data3)
[1] 244075      9

Hello,

I only posted a corrected grep statement, the complete code should be


pat <- c("_esmdes|_Des Section|0")
data3 <- data2[-grep(pat, data2$Layer),]


Sorry for the confusion.

Hope this helps,

Subject: [R] Rmarkdown code rendering as LaTeX, not executing?
References: <1c2bfaef-c32a-8516-2064-0c2b9c1e01c9@zembower.org>
Message-ID: <01000188b597b2b9-2bdf07cd-c0af-40d9-beef-4c580dd2aac5-000000@email.amazonses.com>

Hi, all,

I'm trying to compose an Rmarkdown document and render it as a PDF file. 
My first block of R code seems to work okay, but the second on seems to 
be interpreted as LaTeX code, and not executed as R code. In the output, 
the three back-ticks that mark the R code block are interpreted as an 
opening double-quote, followed by an opening single quote.

Here's my test file:
================================
---
title: "An analysis of US 2020 Census Data for the Radnor-Winston 
neighborhood"
author: "E. Kevin Zembower"
date: "29 May 2023"
output:
    pdf_document:
       extra_dependencies: ["array", "booktabs", "dcolumn"]

---

```{r setup, include = FALSE}

```

\section{Abstract}
In this document, ...

\section{Boundaries of the Radnor-Winston neighborhood}

...

  For the purposes of this report, the
boundaries of RW are as shown in figure \ref{RWneigh}. ...

```{r rw_map,  fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, out.width = "80%", dev = 
"pdf",
fig.cap = "Map of RW neighborhood\label{RWneigh}"}

## Creating a polygon for RW neighborhood, based on CRS 6487 (NAD83
## (2011) / Maryland ) map in meters:
base_x <- 433000
base_y <- 186000
rw_neigh_pg_m <- data.frame(
     matrix(
         c(540, 1140,
           540, 1070,
           480, 1060,
           490, 1000,

           350, 660,
           350, 710,
           180, 725,
           190, 900,
           220, 900,
           220, 1030,
           240, 1030,
           240, 1110
         ),
         ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
) %>% + matrix(c(rep(base_x, nrow(.)), rep(base_y, nrow(.))),
                nrow = nrow(.)) %>%
sf::st_as_sf(coords = c(1,2), dim = "XY") %>%
summarize(geometry = st_combine(geometry)) %>%
st_cast("POLYGON") %>%
st_set_crs(6487)

## Map it:
rw_base_blocks <- read_osm(bb(rw_neigh_pg_m, ext = 1.3))

## Line below gives map in meters
(RW_block_map <- tm_shape(rw_base_blocks, projection = 6487) +
## Line below gives map in degrees
## (RW_block_map <- tm_shape(rw_base_blocks, projection = 6487) +
      tm_rgb() +
      tm_shape(rw_neigh_pg_m) +
      tm_fill(col = "green", alpha = 0.2) +
      tm_borders(lwd = 2, alpha = 1) +
      tm_scale_bar() +
      ## tm_grid() + tm_xlab("Long") + tm_ylab("Lat") +
      tm_grid() +
      tm_layout(title = "Radnor-Winston Neighborhood")
)

## tmap_save(RW_block_map, "rw_map.png")

```
====================================================

This code block can also be obtained from 
https://gist.github.com/kzembower/f9ad52abf82975102cbf715bcfbc0f51.

I'm using Emacs and ESS to create this document. This seems to produce 
its own weirdness, as the text style and font color and sizes change in 
the R code block as I edit it and add spaces and lines.

If the block above is saved as "RW_test.Rmd", I use these lines to 
create the PDF:
===============================
library(rmarkdown)
render("RW_test.Rmd")
================================

No errors are generated.

Can anyone help me understand what I'm doing wrong? A much shorter test 
file I created seems to work okay.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Dear Kevin,

actually you're mixing markdown and LaTeX syntax, which is the reason
why you see LaTeX code in the PDF. You have to choose...

1) Either you wish to produce an RMarkdown document and your sections,
subsections... should read:

# Abstract

In this document, ...

## Boundaries of the Radnor-Winston neighborhood

```{r rw_map,  fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, out.width = "80%", dev
= "pdf",
fig.cap = "Map of RW neighborhood\label{RWneigh}"}

## Creating a polygon for RW neighborhood, based on CRS 6487 (NAD83
## (2011) / Maryland ) map in meters:
base_x <- 433000
base_y <- 186000

[etc]...
```
But you may not use all the power of LaTeX (easily at least).


2) Or you wish to produce a .Rnw (knitr / Sweave file using LaTeX) and
you should use another R code delimitation convention (and change the
heading part of the document to LaTeX usage, that is
\documentclass{}... \usepackage{}...):

<<r rw_map,  fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, out.width = "80%", dev =
"pdf", fig.cap = "Map of RW neighborhood\label{RWneigh}">

## Creating a polygon for RW neighborhood, based on CRS 6487 (NAD83
## (2011) / Maryland ) map in meters:
base_x <- 433000
base_y <- 186000

[etc]

@

Depending on your choice, compiling the document goes through a
different process but both are possible and relatively simple (either
from within RStudio or using any other editor).

Hope this helps for a first approach.

Olivier.

It is safer to use !grepl(...) instead of -grep(...) here.  If there are no
matches, the latter will give you a zero-row data.frame while the former
gives you the entire data.frame.

E.g.,

> d <- data.frame(a=c("one","two","three"), b=c(10,20,30))
> d[-grep("Q", d$a),]
[1] a b
<0 rows> (or 0-length row.names)
> d[!grepl("Q", d$a),]
      a  b
1   one 10
2   two 20
3 three 30

If I don't log transform  my code runs.

Please advise,

Subject: [R] Problem with filling dataframe's column
Message-ID: <00d901d99e3c$a0fc83b0$e2f58b10$@gmail.com>

 
Javad,
 
There may be nothing wrong with the methods people are showing you and if it satisfied you, great.
 
But I note you have lots of data in over a quarter million rows. If much of the text data is redundant, and you want to simplify some operations such as changing some of the values to others I multiple ways, have you done any learning about an R feature very useful for dealing with categorical data called "factors"?
 
If you have a vector or a column in a data.frame that contains text, then it can be replaced by a factor that often takes way less space as it stores a sort of dictionary of all the unique values and just records numbers like 1,2,3 to tell which one each item is. 
 
You can access the values using levels(whatever) and also change them. There are packages that make this straightforward such as forcats which is one of the tidyverse packages that also includes many other tools some find useful but are beyond the usual scope of this mailing list.
 
As an example, if you have a vector in mydata$col1 then code like:
 
mydata$col1 <- factor(mydata$col1)
 
No matter which way you do it, you can now access the levels and make whatever changes, and save the changes. One example could be to apply some variant of grep to make the substitution. There is a family of functions build in such as sub() that matches a Regular Expression and replaces it with what you want.
 
This has a similar result to changing all entries without doing all the work. I mean if item 5 used to be "OLD" and is now "NEW" then any of you quarter million entries that have a 5 will now be seen as having a value of "NEW".
 
I will stop here and suggest you may want to read some book that explains R as a unified set of features with some emphasis on using it for the features it is intended to have that can make life easier, rather than using just features it shares with most languages. Some of your questions indicate you have less grounding and are mainly following recipes you stumble across. 
 
Otherwise, you will have a collection of what you call "codes" and others like me call programming and that don't necessarily fit well together.

Subject: [R] log transform a data frame

Your first data column appears to contain character data (e.g. SYCL) which
cannot be converted to numeric. You also appear to have 0's in the numeric
columns which will cause problems since log(0) is -Inf. Barplots are useful
for categorical data, but not continuous, numeric data which are better
handled with box plots or strip charts.

Do not use printouts of your data since it hides important information. Use
str(a11) and dput(a11) or dput(head(a11)) to provide useful information
about your data.

-- This is false. It used to be true a **long time ago**, but R has for
quite a while used hashing/global string tables to avoid this problem. See
here
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50310092/why-does-r-use-factors-to-store-characters>
for details/references.
As a result, I think many would argue that working with strings *as
strings,* not factors, if often a better default, though of course there
are still situations where factors are useful (e.g. in ordering results by
factor levels where the desired level order is not alphabetical).

**I would appreciate correction/ clarification if my claims are wrong or
misleading! **

In any case, please do check such claims before making them on this list.

Cheers,
Bert

There are packages that make this straightforward such as forcats which is
one of the tidyverse packages that also includes many other tools some find
useful but are beyond the usual scope of this mailing list.

variant of grep to make the substitution. There is a family of functions
build in such as sub() that matches a Regular Expression and replaces it
with what you want.

Thank you so much David, here is correction:

d1=suppressWarnings(read.csv("/Users/anamaria/Downloads/B1.csv",
stringsAsFactors=FALSE, header=TRUE))
d1$X <- NULL
d2=as.matrix(sapply(d1, as.numeric))
pdf("~/graph.pdf")
b<-barplot(d2, legend= c("SYCL", "CUDA"), beside=
TRUE,las=2,cex.axis=0.7,cex.names=0.7,ylim=c(0,80), col=c("#9e9ac8",
"#6a51a3"))
dev.off()

 > dput(head(d1))
structure(list(Domain.decomp. = c("2. 1", "2"), DD.com..load = c(0L,
0L), Neighbor.search = c("3.7", "3. 1"), Launch.PP.GPU.ops. = c("0. 1",
"0"), Comm..coord. = c("1 .6", "1 .0"), Force = c("1 . 5", "1 .2"
), Wait...Comm..F = c("1 .3", "1 .7"), PIE.mesh = c(65.6, 70.9
), Wait.Bonded.GPU = c(0L, 0L), wait.GPU.NB.nonloc. = c(0L, 0L
), Wait.GPU.NB.local = c(0L, 0L), NB.X.F.buffer.ops. = c(7.3,
4.4), Write.traje = c(0.3, 0.3), Update = c(6.3, 4.3), Constraints = c(8.9,
9.7), Comm..energies = c(0.9, 0.9), PIE.redist..X.F = c("8. 1",
"8.7"), PIE.spread = c(29.7, 30.6), PIE.gather = c("19.9", "21 .3"
), PIE.3D.FFT = c(6, 8.6), PIE.3D.FFT.comm. = c("1 .2", "1 .0"
), PIE.solve.Elec = c(0.7, 0.5)), row.names = 1:2, class = "data.frame")

Now my problem is that when I save my plot as PDF my labels on X axis are
cut off. Any advice about that?

Bert,
 
I stand corrected. What I said may have once been true but apparently the implementation seems to have changed at some level.
 
I did not factor that in.
 
Nevertheless, whether you use an index as a key or as an offset into an attached vector of labels, it seems to work the same and I think my comment applies well enough that changing a few labels instead of scanning lots of entries can sometimes be a good think. As far as I can tell, external interface seem the same for now. 
 
One issue with R for a long time was how they did not do something more like a Python dictionary and it looks like ?

If much of the text data is redundant, and you want to simplify some operations such as changing some of the values to others I multiple ways, have you done any learning about an R feature very useful for dealing with categorical data called "factors"?

-- This is false. It used to be true a **long time ago**, but R has for quite a while used hashing/global string tables to avoid this problem. See here <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50310092/why-does-r-use-factors-to-store-characters>  for details/references.
As a result, I think many would argue that working with strings *as strings,* not factors, if often a better default, though of course there are still situations where factors are useful (e.g. in ordering results by factor levels where the desired level order is not alphabetical).
 
**I would appreciate correction/ clarification if my claims are wrong or misleading! **
 
In any case, please do check such claims before making them on this list.
 
Cheers,
Bert
