Subject: [R] Combine two dataframe with different row number and

 Dear Tim;
The dplyr did not work for me. My data frames have exactly similar columns
but different row numbers.
Mr Petr sent this code and the code worked but it copied the second
dataframe into the first one and did not replace the corresponding row.
> df3 = merge(df1, df2, all = TRUE)
Regarding filling the "NA" data, it does not matter for me to interpolate
between numbers or put the mean of numbers.
Sincerely

Hi everyone,

Can some one help me?

If my coding come out the error like this "Error in optim(start, nhl, ...,
method = method) : non-finite value supplied by optim". What it means?
How can I solve this?

Thank you.

Hi Zakaria,

I had such an issue before, and in my case, the problem was that the calculation of the objective for some values used by the optimizer gave back a non-finite result. In general, this might be because the objective function has poles, and the calculation returns inf. Alternatively, there might be a calculation error somewhere in the objective function's code resulting in a nan value. I think that first, you need to determine more precisely what the problem is in your case. You could try evaluating the objective at different points (for instance, your initialization values) to see how it behaves.

I hope this helps!
Pantelis

Hello,

Can you post the code you've tried and sample data? Please post the code 
you ran and the output of `dput(df)`. Or, if it is too big with the 
output of `dput(head(df, 20))`. (Note: `df` is a placeholder for the 
name of your data set.)

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Hi Javad,
You seem to have the data frame join worked out, so here is a function
to interpolate over sequences of NAs. I have found it quite useful.

# interpolate over sequences of NAs
# NA sequences at the beginning of a file are replaced with the first
nonNA value
# NA sequences at the end are filled with the last nonNA value
# sequences of all NAs are returned unaltered
interpNA<-function(x) {
 if(any(is.na(x))) {
  xrle<-rle(is.na(x))
  begin<-end<-1
  # if the sequence begins with NA
  # set the initial run of NAs to the 1st non-NA
  if(is.na(x[1])) x[1:xrle$lengths[1]]<-x[xrle$lengths[1]+1]
  for(i in 1:length(xrle$values)) {
   # if this is a run of NA, fill it
   if(xrle$values[i]) {
    end<-begin+xrle$lengths[i]+(i>1)
    if(is.na(x[end])) x[begin:(end-1)]<-x[begin]
    else x[begin:end]<-seq(x[begin],x[end],length.out=1+end-begin)
    begin<-end+xrle$lengths[i]-1
  }
   else {
    # set begin to the end of the non-NA values
    begin<-end+xrle$lengths[i]-1
   }
  }
 }
 return(x)
}

Hallo

This code do the merging without repeating the NA row.

df3 = merge(df1, df2, by=c("y", "d", "h"), all.y = TRUE)

Cheers

Hi

You could also use approxfun to fill NA values

fff <- approxfun(1:dim(df3)[1], df3$ws.x)
df3$ws2 <- fff(1:dim(df3)[1])
head(df3)
     y d h     ws.x ws.y      ws2
1 2010 1 1       NA   NA       NA
2 2010 1 2       NA   NA       NA
3 2010 1 3 20.46314   NA 20.46314
4 2010 1 4       NA   NA 20.74001
5 2010 1 5       NA   NA 21.01689
6 2010 1 6 21.29376   NA 21.29376

And fill starting or trailing NA by na.locf function from zoo package or
change starting or trailing NA to some value before calling approxfun.

Cheers
Petr

I hope that this is an allowable question - for my hydrological research I
need to create and manipulate maps (ideally in raster form), and get
conversant with GIS.  I have for example downloaded QGIS but am finding the
sites on it opaque, and more widely I am finding it hard to find useful
sources of information on GIS processing in R.

Does anyone know of any accessible sites or useful texts on GIS processing
in R?

Thanks Nick Wray

Hi Nick,

First off, I would suggest going to:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html

also have a close look at
https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2017/RJ-2017-067/RJ-2017-067.pdf

And you might also consider the use of GRASS GIS, which interfaces with R
pretty seamlessly: https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/R_statistics/rgrass7

Best,
Tom

Two comments in addition to what Tom suggested:

This online book comes highly recommended:

https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/


and when you encounter further questions specific to spatial analysis, 
you'll want to post to the R geo special interest group maillist:

Hi Nick,

There are a bunch of resources. You might start with this Spatial Data
Science with R book at https://rspatial.org

The book fondly known as ASDAR (
https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4614-7618-4 ) is a more
comprehensive survey of spatial data in R, but if you?re mainly doing
raster analysis the above may be what you need.

For specific questions, there?s a subject mailing list
https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-geo

Subject: [R] Error Running arules
Message-ID: <6a9b48c4-dbb3-2996-da5c-c11893531454@shdawson.com>

Hi Everyone,


I upgraded my box recently. I am now running R at version 4.2. I 
attempted to do association rules today using arules. I am getting two 
errors.

My first guess is there is something in the build of the arules that is 
not found in r-base. My second guess is the script syntax needs further 
work.

Anyone have an idea how to interpret these two errors, pls?

Hello,

The following code does not merge the two data sets, it creates a third one.

1. split the data by year and day
2. for each sub-df, assign the values in df1$ws to the corresponding df2$ws
3. loop through df3 interpolating the values in ws and replacing the NA 
by the new ones. This is linear interpolation, not to substitute the 
mean for NA's.
4. bind the sub-df's together and remove the temp sp1, sp2.
5. if you want to, you can write df2 wherever df3 occurs. In fact, there 
is no need for the new df3, I have coded it like this to make the 
several steps more clear but you can simply use df2 throughoutthe code 
below.


sp1 <- split(df1, list(df1$y, df1$d))
sp2 <- split(df2, list(df2$y, df2$d))

df3 <- Map(\(X, Y) {
   i <- match(X$h, Y$h)
   Y$ws[i] <- X$ws
   Y
}, sp1, sp2)

df3 <- lapply(df3, \(X) {
   X$ws <- approx(X$h, X$ws, xout = X$h)$y
   X
})

df3 <- do.call(rbind, df3)
str(df3)
rm(sp1, sp2)


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

I have no clue about #2, but do note
----------
ERROR ONE
Attaching package: ?arules?

The following objects are masked from ?package:base?:

     abbreviate, write
---------
is *NOT* an error.  It merely means that arules has its own versions
of abbreviate() and write(), which will be the functions called if you
do not prefix calling the base functions with 'base::', e.g. as in
base::abbreviate(...)

Cheers,
Bert

You may actually want to send an email to the RStudio community.  They deal
with this as a rule.

Thanks,

traceback() is invaluable when debugging errors like this.

It might be a bug in one of the packages you're running. You might end
up having to contact the maintainer (see the maintainer() function) of
one of them to have it fixed.

Dear all,

I am happy to announce that {gMCPLite} is now on CRAN. It is a lightweight fork of {gMCP} for graph-based multiple comparison procedures, with {ggplot2} multiplicity graph visualizations, graphical testing for group sequential design workflows, and essential unit testing.

I hope you find it helpful. Please feel free to reach out with feedbacks or questions.

Bert,
Thanks for the guidance. Do you have a documentation URL I can review to 
research your suggestion?

Ivan,
Thanks for the guidance. The traceback() revealed the same results that 
I shared originally.

This is a bigger problem than coding a command set to run against data. 
It does seem like a version problem with arules or how it leverages 
r-base. I will go to arules maintainer for further guidance.

Subject: [R] stunning matrix multiplication differences Matrix vs. matrix

Hi all,

can somebody help me out with an explanation of this:

attr(,"package")
[1] "Matrix"
[1] "matrix" "array"

Apparently the two matrices "M" and "MM" are entirely identical but the 
difference in results from multiplying both with the same matrix is, say, 
significant.

Even when I transfer M into "matrix" and then back into "Matrix" the 
differences remain:

> M <- as.matrix(M)
> t(RHS)%*%M%*%RHS
1 x 1 Matrix of class "dgeMatrix"
         [,1]
[1,] 5765.366

> t(RHS)%*%M%*%RHS
1 x 1 Matrix of class "dgeMatrix"
         [,1]
[1,] 7264.878

Frankly, I have no clue what's going on!!

You can also use match function to combine the two dataframes as shown below:

wh<- match(interaction(df2[c("y", "d", "h")]), interaction(df1[c("y", "d", "h")])) matched <- !is.na(wh) df2[matched, "ws"] <- df1[wh[matched],"ws"]

Hi

You could also use approxfun to fill NA values

fff <- approxfun(1:dim(df3)[1], df3$ws.x)
df3$ws2 <- fff(1:dim(df3)[1])
head(df3)
     y d h     ws.x ws.y      ws2
1 2010 1 1       NA   NA       NA
2 2010 1 2       NA   NA       NA
3 2010 1 3 20.46314   NA 20.46314
4 2010 1 4       NA   NA 20.74001
5 2010 1 5       NA   NA 21.01689
6 2010 1 6 21.29376   NA 21.29376

And fill starting or trailing NA by na.locf function from zoo package or change starting or trailing NA to some value before calling approxfun.

Cheers
Petr

 stunning matrix multiplication differences Matrix vs. matrix

FAQ 7.31 ?
Your matrices have about 9*10e8 entries after all.

I know almost nothing about the Matrix package, but what does
crossprod(RHS, Z) %*% RHS give for the two versions of Z = M and MM
(assuming Matrix:::crossprod S4 method works here)?
Hopefully a knowledgeable Matrix user will correct me if this is wrong.

Cheers,
Bert

Dear Aaron, David, and everyone,

Thank you again for your comments on my question related to the confidence
intervals. I am sorry for the late reply.

The definition of the 95 confidence intervals where our discussion
originates from has been proposed by the authors of these two articles (I
am including the links to the articles just to show that the formula has
been published in a methods article a while ago; the articles are in the
field of biology though, where not too many of you are part of, I guess).
These authors have written the scripts and they have made those available
on github. I have asked a while ago the authors why they have chosen this
formula, however, I have not received any reply. In any case, at this
moment I will use the mathematical formulas described in the articles :

https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(15)00304-4

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-019-0218-7

Wishing everyone a good weekend,

Bogdan

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] pkglite 0.2.1 is released
Message-ID: <472c1447-c521-4b9b-8274-321a602b56c9@www.fastmail.com>

Dear all,

A new version of pkglite (0.2.1) is now on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=pkglite). pkglite offers a tool, grammar, and standard to represent and exchange R package source code as text files.

This version brings expanded coverage of file types (before: 88.85%, after: 96.65%, tested among all files in all CRAN packages), fewer dependencies, and more low-level enhancements. Please see the changelog (https://merck.github.io/pkglite/news/) for details.

Thanks,
-Nan

I contacted the arules package maintainer.

He concluded the syntax I submitted to this original post is correct. 
The problem he estimates is a version mismatch within my R packages, 
although all packages I am using come from R repositories. Specifically, 
something is off on the r-base version I am running.

I will remove all of R from my box and look to other repositories.

Hello,

Before removing all of R, why not run

update.packages()

?

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Thought about it.

The arules maintainer said to remove and reinstall.

I am not a huge fan of having apps in my home directory.

Oddly, I had to wait for r-base to update to 4.2 as it is a requirement 
of arules.

I went with my distribution's repository for all things R. Then, I went 
for CRAN repository when I could not get r-base at 4.2 from my 
distribution's repository. I am thinking this could be where things got off.

Frankly, I cannot believe things are off. If the primary repository 
shoots me r-base 4.2, cloud.r-project.org got me arules, and the arules 
maintainer says nothing about a particular version of r-base beyond 4.2 
as prompted by arules, then I am wondering if I am about to spend time 
on this versioning effort for nothing.

I know I am not looking forward to this rinse-and-repeat exercise of 
building the box for R again.

Subject: [R] How to use AUC metric in caret
Message-ID: <CA+nrPnu05fFRZmjNDBpp7MW3g8q8G7KfpEiZ3cyK7YMnf6m63Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone

I am using nested resampling in caret (5-fold outer and bootstrap inner
resampling) and by default, it shows the "Accuracy" metric. How can I use
it for the ROC/AUC metric?

My code is:

d=readARFF("apns.arff")
index <- createDataPartition(d$isKilled , p = .70,list = FALSE)
tr <- d[index, ]
ts <- d[-index, ]

boot <- trainControl(method = "boot", number=100, search="random",
classProbs = TRUE, summaryFunction = twoClassSummary)

outer_folds <- createFolds(d$isKilled, k = 5)
boot <- trainControl(method = "boot", number=10)

CV1 <- lapply(outer_folds, function(index){
  tr <- d[-index, ]
  ts <- d[index,]

  cart1 <-train(isKilled ~ ., data = tr,
                method = "rpart",

                    tuneLength = 20,
                 metric = "Accuracy",
                 preProc = c("center", "scale", "nzv"),
                 trControl = boot)

  postResample(predict(cart1, ts), ts$isKilled)
})
sapply(CV1, function(x) x[3]) -> CV_MAE1
CV_MAE1

Hi Subhamitra,
I think the fact that you are passing a vector of values rather than a
matrix is part of the problem. As you have only one value for each
country, The points plotted will be the index on the x-axis and the
value for each country on the y-axis. Passing a value for ylim= means
that you are cutting off the lowest points. Here is an example that
will give you two clusters and show the values for the centers in the
middle of the plot. Perhaps this is all you need, but I suspect there
is more work to be done.

k2<-kmeans(DMs[,2],centers=2)
plot(DMs[,2],col=k2$cluster,pch=19,xlim=c(1,46))
text(1:46,DMs[,2],DMs[,1],col=k2$cluster)
points(rep(23,2),k2$centers,pch=1:2,cex=2,col=k2$cluster)
legend(10,1,c("cluster 1: Highly Integrated","cluster 2: Less Integrated"),
col=1:2,pch=19)

Hello,

I am not at all sure that the following answers the question.
The code below ries to find the optimal number of clusters. One of the 
changes I have made to your call to kmeans is to subset DMs not dropping 
the dim attribute.


library(cluster)

max_clust <- 10
wss <- numeric(max_clust)

for(k in 1:max_clust) {
   km <- kmeans(DMs[,2], centers = k, nstart = 25)
   wss[k] <- km$tot.withinss
}
plot(wss, type = "b")

dm <- DMs[, 2, drop = FALSE]
# Where is the elbow, at 2 or at 4?
factoextra::fviz_nbclust(dm, kmeans, method = "wss")
factoextra::fviz_nbclust(dm, kmeans, method = "silhouette")

k2 <- kmeans(dm, centers = 2, nstart = 25)
k3 <- kmeans(dm, centers = 3, nstart = 25)
k4 <- kmeans(dm, centers = 4, nstart = 25)

main2 <- paste(length(k2$centers), "clusters")
main3 <- paste(length(k3$centers), "clusters")
main4 <- paste(length(k4$centers), "clusters")

old_par <- par(mfcol = c(1, 3))
plot(DMs[,2], col = k2$cluster, pch = 19, main = main2)
plot(DMs[,2], col = k3$cluster, pch = 19, main = main3)
plot(DMs[,2], col = k4$cluster, pch = 19, main = main4)
par(old_par)


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Subject: [R] expand a matrix
Message-ID: <cb3fe723-7f90-10fe-da10-e41002b84e11@yeah.net>

Hi there,

I have a matrix likes:
 > m
      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
[1,]   NA    1    2    3
[2,]    1   NA    6    5
[3,]    2    6   NA    4
[4,]    3    5    4   NA

I hope to expand it to 10 by 10 matrix, M, likes:
 > M
       [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]
  [1,]   NA   NA   NA   NA    1    1    2    3    3     3
  [2,]   NA   NA   NA   NA    1    1    2    3    3     3
  [3,]   NA   NA   NA   NA    1    1    2    3    3     3
  [4,]   NA   NA   NA   NA    1    1    2    3    3     3
  [5,]    1    1    1    1   NA   NA    6    5    5     5
  [6,]    1    1    1    1   NA   NA    6    5    5     5
  [7,]    2    2    2    2    6    6   NA    4    4     4
  [8,]    3    3    3    3    5    5    4   NA   NA    NA
  [9,]    3    3    3    3    5    5    4   NA   NA    NA
[10,]    3    3    3    3    5    5    4   NA   NA    NA

I use the following code:

M <- matrix(NA, 10, 10)

for (i in 1:10) {
    for (j in 1:10) {
       if (i %in% 1:4 & j %in% 5:6) M[i,j] <- M[j,i] <- m[1,2]
       if (i %in% 1:4 & j == 7) M[i,j] <- M[j,i] <-m[1,3]
       if (i %in% 1:4 & j %in% 8:10) M[i,j] <- M[j,i] <-m[1,4]
       if (i %in% 5:6 & j == 7) M[i,j] <- M[j,i] <-m[2,3]
       if (i %in% 5:6 & j %in% 8:10) M[i,j] <- M[j,i] <-m[2,4]
       if (i == 7 & j %in% 8:10) M[i,j] <- M[j,i] <-m[3,4]
    }
}

Is there any convenience way to do it? Thanks!

Best,
Jinsong

You can specify multiple indexes to replace at once, so you can avoid
a for loop entirely like this:
M <- matrix(nrow = 10, ncol = 10)
M[1:4, 5: 6] <- M[5: 6, 1:4] <- m[1, 2]
M[1:4,    7] <- M[   7, 1:4] <- m[1, 3]
M[1:4, 8:10] <- M[8:10, 1:4] <- m[1, 4]
M[5:6,    7] <- M[   7, 5:6] <- m[2, 3]
M[5:6, 8:10] <- M[8:10, 5:6] <- m[2, 4]
M[  7, 8:10] <- M[8:10,   7] <- m[3, 4]
M


You could also specify it directly with function 'matrix', it is
somewhat ugly though:
M <- matrix(c(
        NA,     NA,     NA,     NA, m[1,2], m[1,2], m[1,3], m[1,4],
m[1,4], m[1,4],
        NA,     NA,     NA,     NA, m[1,2], m[1,2], m[1,3], m[1,4],
m[1,4], m[1,4],
        NA,     NA,     NA,     NA, m[1,2], m[1,2], m[1,3], m[1,4],
m[1,4], m[1,4],
        NA,     NA,     NA,     NA, m[1,2], m[1,2], m[1,3], m[1,4],
m[1,4], m[1,4],
    m[1,2], m[1,2], m[1,2], m[1,2],     NA,     NA, m[2,3], m[2,4],
m[2,4], m[2,4],
    m[1,2], m[1,2], m[1,2], m[1,2],     NA,     NA, m[2,3], m[2,4],
m[2,4], m[2,4],
    m[1,3], m[1,3], m[1,3], m[1,3], m[2,3], m[2,3],     NA, m[3,4],
m[3,4], m[3,4],
    m[1,4], m[1,4], m[1,4], m[1,4], m[2,4], m[2,4], m[3,4],     NA,
 NA,     NA,
    m[1,4], m[1,4], m[1,4], m[1,4], m[2,4], m[2,4], m[3,4],     NA,
 NA,     NA,
    m[1,4], m[1,4], m[1,4], m[1,4], m[2,4], m[2,4], m[3,4],     NA,
 NA,     NA
), nrow = 10, ncol = 10, byrow = TRUE)
M


If it interests you, you could take a look at package 'Matrix', it
contains classes for specific types of matrices, including upper
triangular matrices. This package helps to improve speed of linear
algebra computations and reduce the memory size of matrices.

Assuming I understand what you are trying to do, perhaps

i <- rep(1:4, c(4, 2, 1, 3))
m[i, i]

Like most operations in R, indexing is vectorized.

Subject: [R] Reading PDF files with German umlauts using tabulizer
Message-ID: <09dd654e-3f0e-8b1d-ef5c-e52d94d17e3e@numberland.de>

Dear all,

I have some trouble with reading PDF files in German language.

I want to extract text and tables with the tabulizer package, and every 
things goes well as long as I read English texts.

When I try the same code

text <- extract_text(file = "Pub_001.pdf")

with documents in German language

German umlauts are not recognized.

They are either replaced by a combination of characters.

Instead of

"Entmischung und Kristallisation in Gl?sern des Systems"
                                      --
I get

"Entmischung und Kristallisation in GHisern des Systems"
                                      --

or replaced by ascii like this

instead of

"In Gl?sern des Systems"
       -
I get

"In Glasern des Systems"
       -

Opening the file with Adobe Reader tells me that encoding is "Ansi"

Is there a way to read this file correctly?

Thanks in advance for any idea.

Regards

Hi Subhamitra,
I've had a look at this and made some guesses about what you might be
trying to do. If I create a data frame with country, integration and
efficiency, I get a reasonable looking three cluster solution. This may be
completely wrong as far as what you want. When you plot the clusters of the
separate measures, the "Index" values are just the order of the countries
in the data frame. I can't see how this means anything unless you have
ordered the countries on some measure unknown to me. Also, I'm unsure of
what the two measures you are using represent. This may give you a start on
getting sensible clusters. Let me know how you go with it.

# create a data frame with both measures
DMs<-data.frame(Country=DMs1$Country,Integration=DMs1$DATA,
 Efficiency=DMs2$Data)
# perform the clustering
km<-kmeans(DMs[,2:3],centers=3)
# plot the result
plot(DMs$Integration,DMs$Efficiency,
 main="DM clusters by Integration and Efficiency",
 xlab="Integration",ylab="Efficiency",pch=19,
 col=km$cluster)
text(DMs$Integration,DMs$Efficiency+0.03,DMs$Country,col=km$cluster)
points(km$centers,pch=rep(19,3),cex=3,col=1:3)
legend(-0.3,-0.1,
 c("cluster 1","cluster 2","cluster 3"),
 col=1:3,pch=19)

Could you provide a small example (including a small, anonymised
version of ./input/DataSet.csv) that would reproduce the problem? In my
opinion, there's debugging to be done, but that's relatively
complicated. I would start with options(error = recover), browse the
variables at the point of the crash (who's calling eval()? what's the
expression being evaluated? what's in the environment?) and try to
figure out why the expectations of the expression aren't met by the
environment.

What's suspicious is that I can't find any mention of a variable named
"Insert" or a piece of code saying eval(ei, envir) in the code of the
"arules" package, and it doesn't have any non-core or recommended hard
dependencies except "generics". The reason I asked for a traceback() is
to clarify where exactly the error happens and perhaps uncover a reason
for the failure through that.

Hi Ivan,


Thanks for the response.

I added the line to the top of my script:
traceback()

I ran my script with my arules code today. Now, there are no errors. I 
am now getting the expected output from my install, the same output as 
the arules package maintainer is getting per his email to me on his 
findings.

I looked over my notes from the past few days. I did get a kernel update 
from my distribution repository after posting to the help list. I have 
not had the time over the weekend to run the arules script again to 
determine if things are working as expected. I also wanted to take the 
time and think about the problem from a distance to gain perspective.

I can only conclude at this point the kernel used when running the code 
last week was not compatible with r-base 4.2.

I will be grateful for the little things in life being resolved without 
the pain of doing a rinse-and-repeat exercise of uninstalling and 
installing R.

The best way to use traceback() is to run it immediately after getting
an error:

f <- function() g()
g <- function() h()
h <- function() stop("I'm causing an error")
f()
# Error in h() : I'm causing an error
traceback()
# 4: stop("I'm causing an error") at #1
# 3: h() at #1
# 2: g() at #1
# 1: f()

Depending on how you run scripts, placing a traceback() right after the
line that crashes may be not enough: R stops the whole execution
process, requiring you to type traceback() manually. Alternatively,
options(error = traceback) will run it for you every time an unhandled
error happens, including interrupts (which is annoying).

options(error = recover) will let you interactively inspect the values
of the variables at the time of the crash. Using dump.frames (see its
help page) will save the variables into file or global variable to
inspect them later. I haven't seen them shared on the mailing list (too
large?), but it could be an option. options(error = NULL) restores the
default behaviour.

When debugging is unavoidable, R Inferno
<https://www.burns-stat.com/documents/books/the-r-inferno/> is one of
good resources on how to do it with R code.

Congratulations on having it solve itself! Let's hope the error won't
return.

Subject: [R] Reading PDF files with German umlauts using tabulizer

Hi!

The package "tabulizer" seems to be removed from package repositories,
so it is a bit hard to test.

I found the documentation and the syntax of "extract_text" is:

extract_text(file, pages = NULL, area = NULL, password = NULL,
  encoding = NULL, copy = FALSE)

So have you tried to set the "encoding" parameter?

HTH,
Kimmo

Dear members,
                             The following is my code:

> Stst <- 2
> switch(Stst, 1 = print("NO"), 2 = print("YES"))
Error: unexpected '=' in "switch(Stst, 1 ="

Why isn't it printing "YES" on to the console?

many thanks in advance.

Thanking you,
Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

1 and 2 are not valid identifiers in R, so you need to surround them with
backticks to make them valid, the same as quoting a string:

switch(Stst, `1` = print("NO"), `2` = print("YES"))

It doesn't really work.  If the first argument to switch() is a character
string then it chooses the argument by name; for a number it chooses by
position.  In your case the name and position matched so you did not notice
the difference.

> switch(2, `2` = "first", `1` = "second")
[1] "second"
> switch("2", `2` = "first", `1` = "second")
[1] "first"

Dear Bert,
                    Thanks...I went through the doc pages but couldn't glean from that that for numeric options one has to backtick it. I is not given in the doc page...I actually had hundreds of different choices and so cannot depend on evaluation by position...Thanks again...I got to know that 2 is not a valid identifier but`2` is!

Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

Well, as it states on the Help page, which should always be the first
place to look for, ummm, help:

"If the value of EXPR is not a character string it is coerced to
integer. Note that this also happens for factors, with a warning, as
typically the character level is meant. If the integer is between 1
and nargs()-1 then the corresponding element of ... is evaluated and
the result returned: thus if the first argument is 3 then the fourth

So following up on Bill's comment, the arguments do not even need to
be names when Stst evaluates to) an integer:

> Stst <- 2

[1] "YES"

Subject: [R] radials in "circular" function
Message-ID: <CABxY9BNSg0t8Q1v3Rg6_mWx3BT639TcjgY8kJkrEFSbgqeHBsg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.  I am plotting circular statistical data but would like to add
"spokes" ie radials to the points of the circumference.  The function
"lines.circular" would seem to be right, but I simply can't create spokes
with it.   The example given on lines.circular function - RDocumentation
<https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/circular/versions/0.4-95/topics/lines.circular>
is
not clear and doesn't give spokes.   There's also the arrows.circular
function but I don't want the arrow heads.  basically can anyone tell me
how to draw a line from the centre of the circle to a specified plot on the
rim in "circular"?

Thanks Nick Wray

That's because your statement is false. Perhaps you misstated what you
meant, but for numeric options, the match is **always** chosen by
position, whether or not the arguments are labeled, whether or not the
labels are backticked numerics or not.

"I is not given in the doc page...I actually had hundreds of different
choices and so cannot depend on evaluation by position..."

.... which, to repeat, is false if choices evaluate to/can be coerced
to integers. Evaluation is *always* by position in that case.

> a <- 2.3
> switch(a, `44` = 'No', howdy_pardner = 'Yes')
[1] "Yes"

The Help for arrows.circular has a ... argument which it tells you is
passed on to the (graphics package) arrows() function. ?arrows tells
you that this function has a 'length' argument that controls the
length of the arrow head edges. So set length = 0 in your
arrows.circular call to remove the arrowheads, i.e. plot only the
'spokes'.

Cheers,
Bert

The argument names given to any function, including switch(), must be
parsable as R 'names' (a.k.a. 'symbols').   Names are either
   a) sequences of letters, numbers, and underscores that begin with a
letter
or
   b) the contents of a backticked set of characters (with a few
exceptions, like no \uxxxx sequences)

Since calls to switch() are parsed with the same rules as any other
function call, this is not mentioned in the help page for switch().

[Note that your original code died with a syntax error, not a run-time
error that would be specific to switch().]

You DON'T need to use backticks.  switch() is much older than backticks.
Ordinary quotation marks are fine.
> switch(as.character(1), "2"="YES", "1"="NO")
[1] "NO"

Message-ID: <CABxY9BP1rNC7tAyx5X9hD+7uPzTPUzoO52ZuLtGf1ap7kqftkg@mail.gmail.com>

A bit of a philosophical question maybe?  I am no expert in R but I feel at
home in it.  On the other hand I have been wrestling with QGIS, buying
books on it, finding online guides etc and I'm still finding it really
tricky.  For my research I need to analyse both topological data (locations
of streamflow gauges for example) and vector data such as precipitation or
temperature.  There seems to be a fair amount of geospatial stuff in R, as
well as books like Robin Lovelace's, so I am wondering whether I can throw
aside the QGIS stuff and do everything in R with the needed packages etc.
It would give me a lot more time, if nothing else.

I'd appreciate any thoughts about this
Thanks Nick Wray

Do not learn a new software unless you must. I would find a copy of "Geocomputation with R" and skim through it to see if it has figures or chapter/section titles that would suggest that it can do all of the tasks I need. If the answer looks even close to "yes" then I would go that route because the software is more familiar. However now that you have spent time with QGIS, it is all about your guess as to the shortest distance to your goal.

The same is true for any function call; switch() is not special in this
regard.

> f <- function(x, ...) list(...)
> f("x"=1, "2"=2, `3`=3)
$`2`
[1] 2

$`3`
[1] 3

The backticks are required when defining a function with a non-syntactical
name, but the call can use either form.

> f <- function(x, `2`) x - `2`
> f("2"=7, 18)
[1] 11
> f(`2`=7, 18)
[1] 11

The first article had no code and did not describe a formula that I could find which matched your code. The second article is behind a paywall.

Can someone help me with this simple replicable subroutine?
I am expecting the line? t<-gamma/sgamma to produce two different
values. But I confirm that it is doing
tt<-gamma[1]/sgamma[1]
Thanks.

I think you must've written your formula incorrectly. t can be simplified
like this:

t
gamma/sgamma
gamma/sqrt(vgamma)
gamma/sqrt(gamma^2 * v[2, 2])
gamma/sqrt(gamma^2)/sqrt(v[2, 2])
gamma/gamma              /sqrt(v[2, 2])
rep(1, length(gamma))   /sqrt(v[2, 2])

so I'm not surprised that both values of t are equal.

No, it just happens that gamma[1]/sgamma[1] is the same as
gamma[2]/sgamma[2], subject to rounding errors:

> +?? gamma<-exp(b)
> +?? vgamma<-gamma^2*v[2,2]

t = gamma / sgamma = gamma / sqrt(gamma^2 * v[2,2]) =
  = gamma / (abs(gamma) * sqrt(v[2,2])) =
(given gamma = exp(b) > 0)
  = 1 / sqrt(v[2,2]).

R is a programming language, designed for working with data, and
there's add-on packages for spatial data. Once you know how to get and
set aspects of the spatial data objects,
you can do anything computable on spatial data objects. This is true
for any programming language with spatial data packages, such as
Python or Javascript.

If you are wrestling with QGIS to do stuff that you find easy in R,
then you are probably trying to do something "programmatic" in QGIS.
Its data structures are more limited, basically
to spatial features and tables. Without resorting to Python code
(which is integrated into QGIS) there's not a lot you can do to make
repetitive activity easy in QGIS, although there's
the graphical analysis pipeline builder in the toolbox which can be very useful.

What I mostly use QGIS for is input, editing, and visualising multiple
layers of spatial data. There are things that QGIS cartographic engine
can do easily that R's graphics cannot do.
Although you can make "publication quality" maps in R, if you want
high quality cartographic output then it's more easily done in QGIS.

 I'd suggest you do your analysis in R (there are also R packages that
let you use QGIS' processing algorithms if you need them, and also
GRASS and other GIS tools). But if you want to
map your gauges over a base layer and zoom and pan to inspect it, or
you need fine adjustment of mapping output, then use QGIS.  R and QGIS
can both use open spatial data formats
for interoperability, so if you save from R into a GeoPackage then
reading it in QGIS is easy, and vice versa.

If t = 1/sqrt(v[2,2]) and there is no code to change the value of v[2,2] and no code to change to a different cell why would you get two different values? 

One approach to debugging is to make a small example and see if the code output matches (line-by-line) the output you get from doing a manual calculation. If they do not match you at least know where to start looking for a problem. Hand calculation can use pencil and paper or Excel or other tools. It is a tedious task but very effective.

No, it just happens that gamma[1]/sgamma[1] is the same as gamma[2]/sgamma[2], subject to rounding errors:

> +   gamma<-exp(b)
> +   vgamma<-gamma^2*v[2,2]

t = gamma / sgamma = gamma / sqrt(gamma^2 * v[2,2]) =
  = gamma / (abs(gamma) * sqrt(v[2,2])) = (given gamma = exp(b) > 0)
  = 1 / sqrt(v[2,2]).

Thanks to all. It was just programming error. The following now works. 
Essentially, to impose non-negative restrictions I estimated the natural 
logs of two parameters and then do exponential transformation to uncover 
the parameters, with mathematical transformation (delta method) for 
their standard errors.

I believe deltaMethod {car} does that sort of things. I have yet to look 
up if it does that for nonlinear regression object. But since the 
exponential transformation is a simple transformation (with a derivative 
equal to itself), I tried to program my own. Thanks to all.

Not to worry, the second article did not have equations either. It had a couple bits of code and a github link to icechip (page 3295).
I got through the paywall using a link through the University of Florida library system.

Maybe the linked papers include citations that describe the analysis in enough detail, but that effort exceeds my time limit for this activity.

Dear Aaron, David, and everyone,

Thank you again for your comments on my question related to the confidence intervals. I am sorry for the late reply.

The definition of the 95 confidence intervals where our discussion originates from has been proposed by the authors of these two articles (I am including the links to the articles just to show that the formula has been published in a methods article a while ago; the articles are in the field of biology though, where not too many of you are part of, I guess). These authors have written the scripts and they have made those available on github. I have asked a while ago the authors why they have chosen this formula, however, I have not received any reply. In any case, at this moment I will use the mathematical formulas described in the articles :

Our business office gives this advice to faculty members: An emergency on your part is not an emergency on our part.

How about starting by answering the questions posted by the people you are hoping will help. Focus on David's middle paragraph. However, if you can re-code everything to work, then it would seem that you already know the answer and it might be simpler/faster to write the correct code.

You might spend some time looking for a scientific paper that uses that equation for the confidence interval and thereby get some context to explain why the equation is correct.

Hi David,

Thank you for your comments, and feed-back message. I am very happy to learn from the experience of the people on R mailing list, and without any doubt, I am very thankful to you and to everyone for sharing their knowledge. I do apologize for any confusion that I have created unwillingly with my previous email.

About my previous email related to the confidence intervals: indeed I have posted the question with a detailed description on stackoverflow, and the link is listed below.

I have to admit that I have been in rush willing to have the suggestions of R-help members by Monday (if that would have been possible), as I have to make a decision at the beginning of this week on whether I need to re-code the shell script in R. I have a deadline on Wed. The script itself is less important per se, I have included it just to point our the origin of my question.

I do certainly respect the principles of online R-help community, and I would very much appreciate if I could have your advice on the following :
shall a "R code related emergency" arise, would it be acceptable to post the question on stackoverflow with the corresponding data tables and detailed code, and to refer the posting on R-help mailing list ?

If it is acceptable at least for a single email, and if you do not mind, I could mention the link to stackoverflow, inviting our members to read it, shall they be comfortable with this topic.

Hello,
I have plotted data from exploratory factor analysis, and I got a
graph similar to FIGURE 11 (PAGE 36) of this link
file:///home/gigiux/Downloads/An_overview_of_the_psych_package.pdf
How do I interpret the figure? In particular, how do I know what the
colors represent?
Thank you

This appears to be a link you a file on your personal device rather than

Sorry, the file was automatically downloaded and opened with the
browser instead of pointing to the webpage.
Here is a better link:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psychTools/vignettes/factor.pdf
The figure is on page 22.
The question is: The dots have different colors; how do I know what
they represent?
Is there a way to show an auto-legend?
Thank you

It is a bad graphic as the legend that should explain the color coding is missing. The next option is to copy the data and code and see if you can reproduce the figure. You can then play with the code and read a bit about the procedures to figure out what is going on. It should not be too hard. My guess is that there is some additional variable with three states that is being used. If this were the iris data set I would guess it was the three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

Don't use as.integer(), which has performed precisely the service that
it advertises?


I certainly wouldn't call this an 'inadequacy'.


And please stop posting in html.

Dear members,
                             I came across this queer thing during my analysis:
> as.integer("09098")
9098

Any idea on how to retain the "0"?

Yours sincerely,

Dear Tim,
                  So there is no way to coerce "09098" to 09098?

Yours sincerely,

What you're asking for doesn't make sense: 9098 and 09098 are the same

9098L == 09098L

If you mean specifically while printing, you could use sprintf:

cat(sprintf("%05d", 9098))

You seem to be confusing **what** is printed with *how* it is printed.

> print(9) ## a numeric (not an integer, actually. That would be 9L)
[1] 9   ## default print format
> print(formatC(9, width =2, flag = "0")) ## format specification
[1] "09"
> print(formatC(9, width =2, flag = "0"), quote = FALSE) # don't show quotes
[1] 09

See ?formatC and ?print.default for details

Can you tell us why you want to do this? Is there something special about 09098 versus 9098 or 0000009098? In any mathematical operation these are all the same number.

Dear Andrew,
                         THanks for the reply. I am using a integer in a switch statement which has leading zeroes. So I have to coerce it to a character with leading zeroes to compare it. But I think now that I can make do with just the character value. Thanks anyways...

Yours sincerely

Dear Tim,
                  I am using the result of cumsum(), which has leading zeroes, (like 0 0 1 1 2 2), coerce it to a character vector, collapse it, and then coerce it back to an integer to compare it in a switch statement. But now I got it. I can just use the collapsed character value...THanks anyways...

Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

Can you tell us why you want to do this? Is there something special about 09098 versus 9098 or 0000009098? In any mathematical operation these are all the same number.

Dear Tim,

                  So there is no way to coerce "09098" to 09098?



Yours sincerely,

As others pointed out, if you call as.integer()  it converts a string, if
possible, to a particular storage method for an integer. Leading zeroes
either are ignored or in some cases may mean the number is in hexadecimal as
in "0x400" 

If you really must keep track of leading zeroes then keep the string
representation around and use that OR use a plan B. The storage
representation of an integer as 32 bits or 64 bits, or of a float/double,
does not retain any info on leading zeroes.

You can for example pass a string like "0123" or "000000123" and count the
leading zeroes in one of many ways. In the examples above, these are 1 and 6
leading zeroes respectively. There are many ways to count them from the
string version and save that number in a variable. 

Latter, if you need to include the leading zeroes then you can put them back
and combine it. As one of many ways, you can match a regular expression
against "000000123" that matches any initial run of zero or more zeroes
(saving the result) and then matches the remainder of the string, again
perhaps remembering it. This method would now store not the number of zeroes
but a string like "000000" alongside another string for "123".

If some method like that is useful, it can of course be instantiated as some
kind of R object (S3, S4, etc.) that can accept an arbitrary string version
of a number and break it into addressable parts including string and numeric
representations and when printed, recombine them and so on.

But the bottom line is that R is not planning on meeting your specific need.
There may be a package out there that has similar needs BUT that does not
mean everything else will work with such an implementation. Mostly integers
are integers with no leading zeroes.

Pretty sure that guess is incorrect.

I'm not sure there should be a legend. The colors just indicate group 
membership derived from a mathematical process that has attempted to 
separate case into distinct groups that maximize the correlations within 
individual groupings. And therefore maximizes the distance separating 
the groups. The number of groups is specified in the function call. You 
should go to the earlier results and see if you can construct the 
groupings to maximize internal correlations. Psychometricians do this 
when they don't really have a theoretical basis for doing classification 
and are asking the data do it for them. If they are doing this on a 
questionnaire dataset, they often go back to the specific 
questions/answer pairings within groupings and try to assign meaning to 
them.? They then build post-hoc explanations and often do further 
studies to see if they can replicate the results and achieve some sort 
of stable synthetic construct.? It's a rather theory-free strategy and 
so trying to assign labels automatically would be difficult.

Ok, in looking at the code that makes more sense. The code specifies three groups, so there will be three colors. As the groups do not have meaning (hopefully supplied by the user at a later date) there is no legend. They are there to help the user see overlap between groups (none in this case).

I see, so the plot in itself is rather NOT informative -- I need to
make one myself after knowing what groups are there... Fair enough.
Thank you.

The colors just indicate group membership derived from a mathematical process that has attempted to separate case into distinct groups that maximize the correlations within individual groupings. And therefore maximizes the distance separating the groups. The number of groups is specified in the function call. You should go to the earlier results and see if you can construct the groupings to maximize internal correlations. Psychometricians do this when they don't really have a theoretical basis for doing classification and are asking the data do it for them. If they are doing this on a questionnaire dataset, they often go back to the specific questions/answer pairings within groupings and try to assign meaning to them.  They then build post-hoc explanations and often do further studies to see if they can replicate the results and achieve some sort of stable synthetic construct.  It's a rather theory-free strategy and so trying to assign labels automatically would be difficult.

Not quite. What you see in the plot are three distinct groups. The outcome in your application may differ: the groups might be closer together with less clear group boundaries. If the method is successful, you should always ask why? What is the data trying to tell me, and with that information can I see the new pattern in the real world? Here is an example with less clear group boundaries: https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/research/factor-analysis/

Also, this is unsupervised learning. At the start of factor analysis you will not know that there are three groups. If you do know and the goal is to predict membership in a group then maybe something like discriminant analysis would be a better approach.

Subject: [R] Gap between plots, how to reduce
Message-ID: <CA+nrPnvVPLxYXLbcJEVwBStNY_WcH1aMY6v0sdR=OU+yJiWc9A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

There is a gap between plots (white spaces) when I draw the boxplot. I want
to reduce the spaces between the plots so that the boxplot takes a small
space. When I just adjust "boxwex" values, the length of individual plots
increases/decreases but the white spaces is still there.

My code:

RF= c(100,100,100,33.3,100,100)
Ranger= c(66.6, 100, 100, 33.3, 100, 81.8)
SVM= c(81.8, 100, 100, 66.6, 81.8, 81.8)
KNN= c(33.3, 25, 53.8, 25, 11.1, 5.2)
DT= c(100, 100, 100, 25, 100, 100)

mean(DT)

colors = rep("green",6)
at.x <- seq(1,by=.4, length.out = 10)
boxplot(RF,Ranger, SVM, KNN, DT, range = 0, boxwex=0.4,col=colors, names=
c("RF","Ranger", "SVM", "KNN", "DT"),main="Consistent features with 10-fold
vs LOO ")

Hello,

I may be wrong but if you do not change boxwex the deafual boxwex=0.8 is 
used and the white space is reduced.
And if you increase the value, for instance to boxwex = 0.9, the white 
space is even smaller.

Is this what you want?

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Thank you for your reply.

Actually when I adjust boxwex (up to 0.8), it increases the width of the
plot. What I want is to reduce the size of the container (where all the
plots are displayed) so that it takes a small space on the paper.

Best regards

Hello,

OK, if you force the plot area to be square, it will become smaller.
Below, I do not change boxwex.


old_par <- par(pty = "s")  # plot type = square

colors = rep("green",6)
at.x <- seq(1,by=.4, length.out = 10)
boxplot(RF,Ranger, SVM, KNN, DT,
         range = 0,
         col = colors,
         names = c("RF","Ranger", "SVM", "KNN", "DT"),
         main = "Consistent features with 10-fold vs LOO ")

par(old_par)    # put the default back


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Subject: Re: [R] inadequacy in as.integer....

As others pointed out, if you call as.integer()  it converts a string, if
possible, to a particular storage method for an integer. Leading zeroes
either are ignored or in some cases may mean the number is in hexadecimal as
in "0x400"

If you really must keep track of leading zeroes then keep the string
representation around and use that OR use a plan B. The storage
representation of an integer as 32 bits or 64 bits, or of a float/double,
does not retain any info on leading zeroes.

You can for example pass a string like "0123" or "000000123" and count the
leading zeroes in one of many ways. In the examples above, these are 1 and 6
leading zeroes respectively. There are many ways to count them from the
string version and save that number in a variable.

Latter, if you need to include the leading zeroes then you can put them back
and combine it. As one of many ways, you can match a regular expression
against "000000123" that matches any initial run of zero or more zeroes
(saving the result) and then matches the remainder of the string, again
perhaps remembering it. This method would now store not the number of zeroes
but a string like "000000" alongside another string for "123".

If some method like that is useful, it can of course be instantiated as some
kind of R object (S3, S4, etc.) that can accept an arbitrary string version
of a number and break it into addressable parts including string and numeric
representations and when printed, recombine them and so on.

But the bottom line is that R is not planning on meeting your specific need.
There may be a package out there that has similar needs BUT that does not
mean everything else will work with such an implementation. Mostly integers
are integers with no leading zeroes.

Avi

Akshay Kulkarni makes an interesting point, and R supports a further step. If you really want something that supports integer computation but retains the string information then you can shoehorn the latter into an attribute.

x <- as.integer(s) # or some computation that handles octal & hexadecimal
attr(x,?string?) <- s

Now you can compute 2L*x or whatever, but the string travels with x, so it?s easier to recover than if you put it in a separate variable. You?ll have to check the rules for when the result of a computation acquires the attributes of an input.

Regards,
Jorgen.
