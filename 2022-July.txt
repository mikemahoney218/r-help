Ok, the data is pasted below

But on the same data (everything the same) and with other models like RF,
SVM etc, it works fine.

Hi

Maybe
lapply(mydf.split, function(x) aggregate(x[,4:5], list(x$date), sum))

For your particular case, but lacking overall genarality.

Cheers
Petr

I have solved this problem. 

ddply(mydf, c("date", "account"), function(df) {
profit = sum(profit); 
sales = sum(sales); 
data.frame(profit = profit, sales = sales)})

Hello,

The error is in Ranger parameter mtry becoming greater than the number 
of variables (columns).
mtry can be set manually in caret::train argument tuneGrid. But for 
random forests you must also set the split rule and the minimum node.


library(caret)
library(farff)

boot <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)

# set the maximum mtry manually to ncol(tr)
# this creates a sequence of mtry values
mtry <- var_seq(ncol(tr), len = 3)  # 3 is the default value
mtry
#  [1]  2 13 24
#[1]  2 13 24

splitrule <- c("variance", "extratrees")

Best regards

Subject: [R] Subsetting a vector using an index with all missing values
Message-ID: <CA+hbrhUmU4Bsu7HV-rjepBkcvLzyqe3rB7nrtHBKyiZiNkLg8g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I stumbled on subsetting behavior that seems counterintuitive and
perhaps is a bug. Here's a simple example:

> x = 1:10
> x[ rep(NA, 3)]
 [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

I would have expected 3 NAs (the length of the index), not 10 (all
values in x). Looked at the documentation for the subsetting operator
`[` but found nothing indicating that if the index contains all
missing data, the result is the entire vector.

I can work around the issue for a general 'index' using a somewhat
clunky but straightforward construct along the lines of

> index = rep(NA, 3)
> x[c(1, index)][-1]
[1] NA NA NA

but I'm wondering if the behaviour above is intended.

Thanks,

Peter

This has to do with the mode of the subscript - logical subscripts are
repeated to the length of x and integer/numeric ones are not.  NA is
logical, NA_integer_ is integer, so we get

> x <- 1:10
> x[ rep(NA_integer_, 3) ]
[1] NA NA NA
> x[ rep(NA, 3) ]
 [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

That nicely explains the difference in outcome between 
x[rep(TRUE,3)]
x[rep("TRUE",3)]


I do not quite get it.
x<-1:10
x[rep(x<2,3)]
[1] 1 NA NA
The length is three

but
x[rep(x>2,3)]
[1] 3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
The length is 24

Perhaps it should be an error if the length of a logical subscript is
bigger than the dimension it is subscripting.  Currently in that case, x is
extended (with NA or NULL) to the length of the logical subscript.  I doubt
this is desired very often.

c(NA_integer_, NA_integer_)
> dput((1:3)[c(FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)])
c(3L, NA)

AFAIK there is no package wmtsa anymore. It has been archived on 
2020-06-09 [1], the latest version was wmtsa_2.0-3.tar.gz from 2017-12-06.

If I understand correctly the rules for "archived" packages, anyone is 
free to download them, compile them locally -- AND resubmit any such 
package with themselves as the maintainer:  They were archived, because 
they would no longer pass CRAN checks, and the designated maintainer 
failed to respond to the notice of problems with newer versions of R. 
If anything I've said here is wrong or poorly nuanced, I trust someone 
knowledgeable will correct me.  Spencer Graves

Dear Respected Sir,
Thank you for the quick response. However, the link your shared provides
the old version of wmtsa that is not working in R 4.2.0.
Can you please tell me any other solution for this issue?

	  Are you familiar with the "debug" function?


	  You can download the package, source the function you want to use. 
If it doesn't run or doesn't seem to give a sensible answer, debug(fun) 
followed by fun(arg1, arg2, arg3) will start the function then stop and 
invite you to walk through the function line by line.  You can look at 
what it does, and change it as you like.  Doing so should help you learn 
R while also making it easier for you to figure out how to make the 
function do what you want.


	  Hope this helps.

Would package versions help? It would allow you to install a specific version of wmtsa into R 4.2.

Your response suggests that you do not understand how one installs a source package for R. You probably need to educate yourself about how to compile packages from source. Since the process is different for Linux, MacOS, and Windows, you would need to pay attention to the specific requirements of your unnamed OS.

You might find as I did that the wmtsa package has some dependencies that are also archived, namely pkg:splus2R (provided generously by Insightful for many years but apparently no longer) and pkg:ifultools. They both have incompatibilities that prevent compilation from source with my Mac setup. I did find a mirror that has a binary version of splus2R that did install and load.

install.packages("splus2R", repo="https://mirrors.vcea.wsu.edu/r-cran/", type="binary", dependencies=TRUE)

So maybe part of your PhD training should be learning how to compile packages and address changes in the compilers being used as R evolves. That is beyond my capabilities for offering assistance. Alternately you might find a forum or a consultant with similar interests to yours. Again, I can offer no assistance because I have never used pkg:wmtsa and don't know what it provided when it was compatible with the CRAN universe.

BUT you do not need to compile the entire package to use a function in 
it:  You only need to source that particular function ... and any others 
it calls that you don't already have ;-)  That simplifies the task 
greatly.  With luck, Muhammad Zubair Chishti can source only the desired 
functions, and they will run and do what is desired with no further 
effort.  If not, Muhammad can be guided by the error message(s):  If 
they complain that a certain function is not available, Muhammad can 
find it and source it.  If the problem is more subtle, Muhammad can use 
"debug", as I earlier suggested.  Spencer Graves

Dear memebers,
                            I have list of stock data OHLCData for 500 stocks, 15 of whom are NA's. The following is the code:

require(quantmod)
getOHLCData <- function(NSESym) {
  OHLCData1 <- list()
  for(i in 1:500){
    OHLCData1[[i]] <- tryCatch(getSymbols(NSESym[i], auto.assign=FALSE),
                          error = function (e) {print(i); return(NA)})

  }
  return(OHLCData1)
}

 OHLCData <- getOHLCData(NSESym)

however, when I check for is.na, I get the following:

length(OHLCData)
[1] 500
> length(is.na(OHLCData))
[1] 500

length(is.na(OHLCData)) should return 15. Whats going wrong? I assume is.na returns TRUE if there is an NA.

Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

Dear Andrew,
                      It's working! Thanks... I thought the following

> length(is.na(c(1,2,3,NA)))

would return

[1] 1

But got to know the difference ... thanks.

Subject: [R] mgcv: estimate concurvity vs worst concurvity in GAMs
Message-ID: <CANg3_k9XPzN2JJxOC0oBHiqaohnkOrsOCUbNFfkiNVr_H_egxg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

I was wondering if someone could explain (in conceptual terms) how to
interpret *estimate* concurvity in a GAM implemented with mgcv and how
it differs from *worst* concurvity (as obtained through mgcv's
concurvity function). I understand that concurvity is the
non-parametric analogue of collinearity in GAMs and that it represents
the extent to which a smooth term can be approximated by one or more
of the other smooth terms in the model.

It seems to be common practice to base one's course of action on the
worst concurvity estimate (as e.g. advised in Noam Ross' course on
GAMs). However, the mgcv help page for concurvity states that worst
concurvity is a "fairly pessimistic measure, as it looks at the worst
case irrespective of data", whereas estimate concurvity "does not
suffer from the pessimism or potential for over-optimism of the
previous two measures, but is less easy to understand".

Worst concurvity is extremely high in my GAMs, whereas estimate
concurvity is much lower (see below), so I am unsure as to whether I
should deal with the concurvity. I should stress that the aim of my
model is to gain an understanding of the relationship between
variables, rather than pure prediction performance.

For those interested, concurvity values are for a GAM with number of
daily deaths as response variable, and a smooth of time, a smooth of a
heat variable (wbgt_mean) and a smooth of precipitation as predictors,
the latter one being a potential confounder and wbgt_mean being the
variable of interest.  Heat and precipitation are modelled as having
distributed lag (6 days), set up as 7 column matrices as per Simon
Wood's book on GAMs (2017, p. 352). The model is as follows:

c1b <- gam(deaths_ip~s(time, k=200) + te(wbgt_mean, lag, k=c(12, 4)) +
te(precip_daily_total, lag, k=c(12, 4)), data = dat, family = nb,
method = 'REML', select = TRUE)

Let's ignore the issue of time decomposition for the moment, since
none of the many ways I've tried reduced concurvity much.

Depending on whether I have to deal with concurvity or not, my models
and their interpretation will look very different. As a potential
solution for high concurvity, I developed alternative models using a
detrended measure of heat as a predictor (by using residuals from a
GAM with heat as response and time as a predictor). Same for
precipitation. This does reduce concurvity substantially, but it
severely reduces the practical application/ interpretation of the
results, so I'd rather not take this route if I can avoid it.
(Modelling with an autoregressive term, as helpfully suggested in
response to a previous post, did not help to reduce concurvity
either).

Below is the output from the concurvity function with argument
full=TRUE. Explanations of estimate vs worst concurvity will be very
gratefully received!

                      para          s(time)       te(wbgt_mean,lag)
   te(precip_daily_total,lag)

Dear AVi,
                 Thanks ....got to know the difference...should have used sum() instead of length()...

Yours sincerely,

People often use sum() to count how many boolean values are true, not length).

Actually, Bill, I suspect there is a not uncommon use when you want a briefer logical vector to be broadcast or re-used as often as needed.?

The example below, if it can be read, uses an abbreviated set of boolean vectors to get the odd elements of another vector, then the even ones, and then the ones not divisible by three because it gets recycled. I suggest there are many variants like this in use, albeit a better design for some things might have been to add a flag to allow such expansion and otherwise consider it an error.

Perhaps it should be an error if the length of a logical subscript is
bigger than the dimension it is subscripting.? Currently in that case, x is
extended (with NA or NULL) to the length of the logical subscript.? I doubt
this is desired very often.

@Rui Barradas <ruipbarradas at sapo.pt>

I tried the code according to your comments and it works. However, when I
try it for another dataset with a different number of input features, it
again shows the same error message. I tried it with different types of
datasets and the same error appeared.

Best regards

Reread Bill's comment. It referred to logical indices being **longer** than
the vectors they subscript. You have it the other way round.

Can we start a step back please?
wmtsa stands for
  Wavelet Methods for Time Series Analysis.

OK, so you have some time series data,
and for some reason you want to analyse
your data using wavelets.  No worries.
But does it have to be THIS unmaintained
package?

Why not visit

https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=TimeSeries
and search for "wavelets" in the text?
Oh heck, I might as well do it for you.
<snip>
*Wavelet methods* : The wavelets
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wavelets/index.html> package
includes computing wavelet filters, wavelet transforms and multiresolution
analyses. Multiresolution forecasting using wavelets is also implemented in
mrf <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mrf/index.html>. WaveletComp
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WaveletComp/index.html> provides
some tools for wavelet-based analysis of univariate and bivariate time
series including cross-wavelets, phase-difference and significance tests.
biwavelet <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/biwavelet/index.html> is
a port of the WTC Matlab package for univariate and bivariate wavelet
analyses. mvLSW <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mvLSW/index.html>
provides tools for multivariate locally stationary wavelet processes.
LSWPlib <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/LSWPlib/index.html>
contains functions for simulation and spectral estimation of locally
stationary wavelet packet processes. Tests of white noise using wavelets
are provided by hwwntest
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hwwntest/index.html>. Wavelet
scalogram tools are contained in wavScalogram
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wavScalogram/index.html>. Further
wavelet methods can be found in the packages rwt
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rwt/index.html>, waveslim
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/waveslim/index.html>, wavethresh
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wavethresh/index.html>.
</snip>

Presumably there is a reason that nobody else has
bothered to continue maintaining wmtsa.  Perhaps
one of those other wavelets + time series packages
can do what you need?

A postscript to my previous comment.
I used to supervise PhD students.
Let me advise you to write this issue up as a draft section for your thesis.
1. Why I wanted to use the wmtsa package.
2. Why I didn't.
3. How I went about selecting a replacement.
4. What I chose and why that's the right choice.
5. How the analyses I wanted to do are done in
   package X and what difference it makes.

Off the top of my head, the only reasons for struggling to use an old
package are to try to replicate someone else's results and/or to try to use
their software (built atop the dead package) with new data.  Well, if you
get different results, that's interesting too, and then it's time to work
harder to resurrect the dead package.

Speaking of which, an easier route might be to set up a separate
environment running an old version of R that *can* run the old code and the
old code's dependencies.  In fact trying to use the same versions that the
work you're trying to reproduce used might make a lot of sense.

Overall, I think selecting an alternative package
that *is* currently maintained is the best use of your time, but your
supervisor should be able to help you with that.  Selecting appropriate
packages is part of doing research, after all, and demonstrating
that you can do it is all to the good, no?

Dear Respected Experts and specifically Professor Richard O'Keefe,
Thank you so much for your precious time and generous help. However, the
problem is still there and I am just unable to resolve it due to the lack
of expertise in R. Still, the hope is there. I believe that this platform
can help me.

It seems like this package was archived because package "ifultools"
was archived. I tried installing "ifultools" from source, but it has a
seriously large amount of C compilation issues. The main issue seems
to be that variable PROBLEM was never defined anywhere, and it is
unclear what its definition should be. Unfortunately, as far as I can
tell, this issue is unfixable. If you want to install "wmtsa", you'll
have to use an older version of R. Otherwise, you can use one of the
other wavelet analysis packages that Richard O'Keefe mentioned.

Muhammad Zubair Chishti:


	  What specifically have you tried?  What were the results?


	  Please "provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible 
code", per "the posting guide 
http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html", as indicated in at the end 
of each email in this thread.


	  And don't overlook the suggestion I made:  Download the archived 
package.  Do NOT try to compile it. Instead source only the function you 
want, try to run it.  With luck, it will work.  If it doesn't, you will 
get a diagnostic that can help you take the next step.

Spenser,
the idea to source the fonction makes sense but since tho OP is a very
new beginner perhaps you could point him towards code showing him how
to do this?  I have never done this AFAIR, and while I suspect a few
minutes googling would show me how, it is likely to be more difficult
for a noobie.

This is why research students have supervisors.
A research degree is training in doing research.
When you get stuck, your supervisor (or co-supervisor) is supposed to help
you unstick yourself.
Asking random strangers can never be as good as asking someone who already
understands whatever it is you are actually trying to do.
Supervisors have knowledge and experience relevant to the research their
students are doing.  It's not always *much* more.  In fact, I once
"supervised" a student who had years of industrial experience in his topic,
when I knew just the basics of the subject.  He taught me a lot.
But one thing a supervisor ought to be able to do for you is to ask the
random strangers in a much clearer way.  He should be able to explain what
you are trying to do.
If, for example, he knows that you are trying to replicate someone else's
work as a prelude to extending it, he has the status to ask THEM what
package they recommend now.

You seem to be insisting that this one package is what you need and no
other, but you haven't told us WHY it has to be this package.
- We do not know what kind of data you have.
- We do not know why you think a wavelet analysis is appropriate.
  (I don't really understand wavelets and what they can do.  It is a big
gap in my education, but there are so many others it's near the bottom of
the list.)
- We do not yet have any reason to believe that a wavelet analysis IS a
particularly good way to deal with your data.
- We do not know what you want to learn from the data.
- We do not know whether your literature survey has turned up any other
papers doing something similar.
The metaphor I'm about to offer is a bit hyperbolic, but I hope it gets the
idea across.
Student: I want to get the HCN from the Poisons Cabinet here but the key I
have doesn't work.
Helpful random stranger: I tell you what, why not join a lock sports club
[they exist], buy the Genesis kit [real product] of lockpicking tools from
Covert Instruments [real company], and learn how to pick the lock?
REALLY helpful random stranger: What the hell do you want HCN for?

Other people have made it clear that you personally are NOT going to get
wmtsa working with reasonable effort, and nobody is paying any of us to
resurrect a dead package.  At SOME point you are going to have to describe
very clearly, as if to an intelligent 14-year-old,
- what kind of data you have
- what physical or social processes generated that data
- what kind of insight you think can be obtained from it
- what the raw data look like
- some crude "exploratory" statistics on the data
- what kinds of models other people with similar data have used
- what specific methods of analysis you intend to use/did use
- how you can tell whether the answers make sense
- what you are going to do with the answers
All of this needs to be part of the thesis.  You are going to have to write
it SOME time.  If not now, when?  If not you, who?

When you understand what you want to do well enough to explain it, you will
be able to ask much better questions, of the form
"I wanted to use wmtsa to do <X> to <Y>.
 What's a good package for that these days?
 Is there a textbook about doing <X> with R?"

As a former supervisor, I hope, oh how much I hope, that you were not
planning to just load wmtsa, turn the crank on a script you found down the
back of a couch, and believe whatever came out.  I've known Masters and
even PhD students do that.  Not mine, at least not for long.  I also hope
that you have a good supervisor and a good working relationship.  Speaking
from experience, one thing that really ANNOYS a good supervisor is a
student who stays stuck instead of asking for advice.  (I've been that
student.  I was much stupider then.)  It makes the supervisor feel
disrespected.

I'm not quite sure what "source the fonction" means.
The wmtsa package is available from the archive as a
compressed archive wmtsa_2.0-3.tar.gz.
% tar xf wmtsa_2.0-3.tar.gz
creates a directory wmtsa/ with subdirectories
wmtsa/man and wmtsa/R plus some other files.
The documentation is in wmtsa/man/*.md
The source code is in wmtsa/R/*.R
You look at either using whatever text editor you feel like.
Looking at wav_xform.R I see hundreds of lines of code
that only a mother could love, with a good table of contents
but no really informative comments anywhere.
I am reminded, as too often, that there are people who develop packages for
R, and there are software engineers, but there are precious few software
engineers developing packages for R.
As it happens, I *am* a software engineer (amongst other things),
and I do have a tolerably good knowledge of base R, and a high tolerance
for looking things up in the documentation.  But I would have to be paid
quite a large sum of money before I would spend any time on this
code-base.  There are other currently maintained packages that might be
able to do the job, so it would be a waste of my time.

My advice is
  DON'T spend any time looking at this code.
  An R beginning WON'T understand it.
  DO ask your supervisor help you to select an alternative,
  and if you can't figure that out between you,
  ASK a more informative question.

Hi, Richard:  Thanks for the question.


	  "Source the function" means the following.


	  1.  Go to "https://cran.r-project.org/" and download the most recent 
version.  To do that, I found "archived" under "Related Directories".  I 
clicked on that and then searched for "wmtsa".  To the right of that, it 
says it was "Last Modified" "2020-06-09 07:24".  Note that "Last 
Modified", because you can use that to find recent documentation, etc., 
from "archive.org" shortly prior to that date.


	  2.  Click on "wmtsa".  That takes you to "Index of 
/src/contrib/Archive/wmtsa", which includes 11 different versions of the 
source code for that package from "wmtsa_1.0-1.tar.gz 2007-09-23 21:54 
139K" to "wmtsa_2.0-3.tar.gz 2017-12-06 12:14 151K" Click on the last 
one to download it.  This downloaded a file by that name to the 
"Downloads" folder in my computer.


	  3.  Create a directory for that file.  I have a directory called "R" 
on my computer.  I just created a new directory called "wmtsa" within 
that "R" directory.  Then I moved that file into that directory and 
unzip it by double clicking on it.  As a result, I now have a directory 
"~R/wmtsa/wmtsa".


	  4.  To compile that package, I routinely in a Terminal in R (called 
something else in Windows), I "cd" until I get to "~R/wmtsa".  Then I 
run "R CMD check "wmtsa_2.0-3.tar.gz".  I just did that.  It said, 
"ERROR  Packages required but not available: 'splus2R', 'ifultools'". 
In R, I was able to download the first using 
"install.packages('splus2R')".  When I tried 
"install.packages('ifultools')", I got a message, "package ?ifultools? 
is not available for this version of R".


	  5.  However, the inner "wmtsa" directory contains, among other 
things, directories called "man" and "R".  The latter directory contains 
files with names like "wav_boot.R", ..., "wav_xform.R".  I'm assuming 
you have documentation that tells you which function(s) you want to run. 
  Let's say you want to run "wavBestBasis".  If you are lucky, there 
will be a file with a name like "wavBestBasis.R".  That doesn't work in 
this case.  So instead I did a cd into that ~R/wmtsa/wmtsa/R".  Then I 
did "grep 'wavBestBasis' *.R".  I got the following:


wav_xform.R:##    wavBestBasis
wav_xform.R:# wavBestBasis
wav_xform.R:"wavBestBasis" <- function(costs)
Let's say it says you want to start with a f


	  6.  That says that "wavBestBasis" is in file "wav_xform.R".  I opened 
that file in RStudio (I use the free version) then clicked on the 
"Source" button in the upper right.


	  7.  Also, in the directory "~R/wmtsa/wmtsa/man" I found a file called 
"wavBestBasis.Rd".  I opened that in R.  To learn how to read that, you 
can type "help.start()", which will open a menu that includes, "Writing 
R Extensions".  Click that.  That tells you how to write (and read) a 
*.Rd file.  That file "wavBestBasis.Rd" contains and "\examples" 
section.  The first line in that section is "W <- 
wavDWPT(diff(atomclock), n.level=6)".  I ran that, and got:


Error in diff(atomclock) : object 'atomclock' not found


	  I won't discuss how to find "atomclick".  If you need that, you can 
ask again.


	  Hope this helps.
	  Spencer

Subject: [R] Where to find the source code for survey::SE
Message-ID: <F27D7C26-CABD-497C-890F-9AF07B8A1ED0@gmail.com>

Hello! I want to port some functionality from the Survey package to Julia and I am stuck on standard error calculation. How is the standard error calculated in the Survey package?

I searched in the can/survey repo on GitHub and I couldn?t find the source code of the SE function. I also looked through Thomas Lumley?s book Complex Surveys A Guide to Analysis Using R and from there I understood that the standard error is calculated by first calculating the Horvitz-Thompson variance estimator and then taking the square root of that, but I get completely different results.

This is the R code I used:

> library(survey)
> data(api)
> dclus1 <- svydesign(id = ~dnum, weights = ~pw, data = apiclus1, fpc = ~fpc)
> svyby(~api00, by = ~cname, design = dclus1, svymean)

And this is what I obtain:

                  cname    api00           se
Alameda         Alameda 669.0000 1.264044e-15
Fresno           Fresno 472.0000 0.000000e+00
Kern               Kern 452.5000 0.000000e+00
Los Angeles Los Angeles 647.2667 1.724959e+01
Mendocino     Mendocino 623.2500 0.000000e+00
Merced           Merced 519.2500 0.000000e+00
Orange           Orange 710.5625 0.000000e+00
Plumas           Plumas 709.5556 1.248655e-13
San Diego     San Diego 659.4364 2.296800e+00
San Joaquin San Joaquin 551.1892 1.354175e-13
Santa Clara Santa Clara 732.0769 1.577292e+01


With Julia this is the result I get:

11?3 DataFrame
 Row ? cname        mean     se       
     ? String15     Float64  Float64  
??????????????????????????????????????
   1 ? Alameda      669.0     6469.11
   2 ? Fresno       472.0     7832.61
   3 ? Kern         452.5    10703.1
   4 ? Los Angeles  647.267   5232.24
   5 ? Mendocino    623.25   10364.8
   6 ? Merced       519.25    8616.22
   7 ? Orange       710.563   5534.39
   8 ? Plumas       709.556   7673.15
   9 ? San Diego    659.436   1882.06
  10 ? San Joaquin  551.189   2254.24
  11 ? Santa Clara  732.077   4000.03

And just to have the full picture, this is my code for the Horvitz-Thompson variance estimator:

The standard error in the resulted data frame above is just the square root of the hte result.

hi, are you looking for the code in survey:::svymean.survey.design2   ?
running `debug(svymean)` and `debug(svyrecvar)` might help you step through
the calculations..

Dear members,
                          I am using pbmclapply, the progress bar version of mclapply, from the parallel package. The point is, pbmclapply is three times faster than mclapply, and I think the most probable reason would be that pbmclapply is byte code compiled (I can think of no other reason).

I know the cmpfun function from compiler package. If I do:

> cmpfun(mclapply)

will the job be done? The point is mclapply may look for other functions in the parallel package. So I have to compile the whole package right? How do you do that? or in general, how do you byte code compile a whole package?

Thanking you,
Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

Unlikely

See here:

https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/08/how-to-make-best-use-of-the-byte-compiler-in-r/

Byte code compilation should be automatic in both cases, as I understand
it. Of course, I could be wrong due to special features of parallel
programming, etc.

A reprex might be helpful here.

Cheers,
Bert

Subject: [R] Space between axis title and tick labels in persp plot in R
 (using vis.gam)
Message-ID: <CANg3_k_6XXX5qFsbQAd49h2Ty7sPUCD5Xqp4zHJf1W=AXy2N=g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I am making a perspective plot of my generalised additive model (GAM)
named a1b, using vis.gam() in mgcv, which in turn makes use of the
persp function in base R.

Code is as follows:

library(mgcv)
vis.gam(x = a1b,
        view = c("wbgt_max", "lag"),
        plot.type = "persp",
        xlab = "max WBGT (?C)",
        ylab = "lag (days)",
        zlab = "deaths",
        theta = 60,
        phi = 15,
        r = sqrt(3),
        d = 1,
        type = "response",
        ticktype = "detailed")

The plot can be found here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72884763/space-between-axis-title-and-tick-labels-in-persp-plot-in-r-using-vis-gam

On the x and z-axes, the axis title and axis labels are plotted over each other.


I would like to:

1) increase the space between the axis titles and the tick labels for
the x and z- axes (WBGT and deaths) and
2) increase the space between the ticks and the tick labels.

I've looked up similar posts on StackOverflow, which suggest adding
the following code to the plot (and change the values for the
currently stated defaults):

par(mgp=c(3,1,0))

like

library(mgcv)
par(mgp=c(20,20,20))
vis.gam(x = a1b,
        view = c("wbgt_max", "lag"),
        etc.

However, this changes nothing at all to the plot. (I tried with c(20,
20, 20) , smaller values and larger ones).

Would be grateful for any suggestions!

Jade

Dear Bert,
                 Thanks for your reply...

So
> cmpfun(mclapply)

should  do the job right?

By the by, how can I give a reprex? Reprex of the code that I am giving to mclapply (as FUN argument)?

Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

A reprex is a minimal example that performs as you described. It is up to you to trim your code down to eliminate irrelevant computation while not eliminating the described behavior. You may discover something about your own code in the process that answers your question, or you will be able to demonstrate the issue, or we may still not be able to reproduce if it is related to your system.

mclapply is already byte compiled as it is in a package.

You may want to
cmpfun(yourFunction)
the function that you use in the mclapply call.

Best,

Subject: [R] Space between axis title and tick labels in persp plot in R
 (using vis.gam)

R does not provide a native 3D coordinate syytem in base graphics. 
Therefore, persp() is rather a hack that plots everything based on its 
internal code into the device.
Labels are not in the marhings of the 2D coordinate system, hence the 
related par() are not functional.

I'd suggest to add the axis titles manually after the plot and keep the 
rest unless you want to look fpr alternatives to persp().

Best,
Uwe Ligges

Thanks for the response Uwe. It's really helpful! I can spend my time
on doing more useful stuff now :-)

 Hello,

I have been looking for help with an issue I am having with the RODBC package .? I recently upgraded to R 4.2.0 from R 4.1.1 in Windows 10 Enterprise Build 19044.? I use the RODBC package along with the IBM DB2 ODBC driver version 11.01.331.368 to access DB2 databases.? Using the RODBC package in 4.1.1, everything works as it should.? I am able to connect to the DB2 databases without any problems.??
After upgrading to R 4.2.0 and upgrading the RODBC package, I haven't been able to connect at all, and I receive the following error message: "ERROR: state IM004, code 0, message [Microsoft] [ODBC Driver Manager] Driver's SQLAllocHandle on SQL_HANDLE_ENV failed".??
When I searched the web for anyone else experiencing?the same issue, there were a few mentions of the same problem but did not mention any remedies.? Has anyone else experienced any issues with using the DB2 ODBC driver in R 4.2.0?? I downgraded back to R 4.1.1 and everything worked fine once again.
Any help would be appreciated.

Dear Uwe,
                  I have attached the info from the parallel package description from my Rstudio IDE:

Package: parallel
Version: 4.1.2
Priority: base
Title: Support for Parallel computation in R
Author: R Core Team
Maintainer: R Core Team <do-use-Contact-address at r-project.org>
Contact: R-help mailing list <r-help at r-project.org>
Description: Support for parallel computation, including by forking
   (taken from package multicore), by sockets (taken from package snow)
   and random-number generation.
License: Part of R 4.1.2
Imports: tools, compiler
Suggests: methods
Enhances: snow, nws, Rmpi
NeedsCompilation: yes
Built: R 4.1.2; x86_64-w64-mingw32; 2021-11-01 18:38:05 UTC; windows

It says: NeedsCompilation: yes

How about it?

Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

mclapply is already byte compiled as it is in a package.

You may want to
cmpfun(yourFunction)
the function that you use in the mclapply call.

Uwe Ligges

Hello,

Sorry to intrude in this thread but what NeedsCompilation means is that 
the package contains C, C++ or Fortran native code in a directory named src.

 From the documentation, Writing R Extensions, section 1.1.1 The 
DESCRIPTION file:


The ?NeedsCompilation? field should be set to "yes" if the package 
contains native code which needs to be compiled, otherwise "no" (when 
the package could be installed from source on any platform without 
additional tools). This is used by install.packages(type = "both") in R 
 >= 2.15.2 on platforms where binary packages are the norm: it is 
normally set by R CMD build or the repository assuming compilation is 
required if and only if the package has a src directory.


And package parallel does have a src directory with C code.

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#The-DESCRIPTION-file


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

That item refers to the package having some compiled language (e.g. C, C++, Fortran, etc) components. The very fact that it got installed confirms that compilation occurred... it would not be usable otherwise.

Dear Jeff,
                THen why is pbmclapply 3 time faster than mclappy? In the package description of pbmclapply it says: "Needs compilation no". When i ran my code iwith pbmclapply, I did not compile my code. So I do presume that the speed up must in some way connected to this "NeedsCompilation" field. Any thoughts on that?

Yours sincerely
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

That item refers to the package having some compiled language (e.g. C, C++, Fortran, etc) components. The very fact that it got installed confirms that compilation occurred... it would not be usable otherwise.

I don't know why one is faster. You have not provided a reprex (the "reprex" package may be of help to you with that). However, as Rui confirmed, you are completely wrong as to the NeedsCompilation setting in the package... that is a wild goose chase.

Dear Jeff,
               Thanks for the reply....can you please refer some online resources for  getting the reason why pbmclapply is more faster? There should be some reason right?  If a reprex is essential, I will provide when the code is ready(I am still working on it). Thanks in advance...

Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

Dear Akshay,

All of this seems very confused, and you don't appear to attend to 
people's attempts to help you:

(1) All packages on CRAN are byte-compiled.

(2) The NeedsCompilation field in the package DESCRIPTION file refers 
not to byte-compilation but to the presence of C, C++, or Fortran code 
in the package, which needs to be compiled in the traditional sense.

(3) Oddly, the current version 1.5.1 of the pbmcapply package (not 
pbmclapply, which is a function in pbmcapply) does include C code and 
therefore sets NeedsCompilation to true (see 
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pbmcapply/index.html>).

(4) Most oddly of all, the pbmclapply() function calls the mclappy() 
function in the parallel package and indeed is described in ?pbmclapply 
as "a wrapper around the mclapply function." Simply look at the code for 
pbmclapply(). It is therefore very curious that pbmclapply() is faster 
than mclapply(), and in the absence of a reproducible example 
illustrating this phenomenon, I doubt that anyone will be able to tell 
you why. It might also help to know something about your system, as 
reported by Sys.info(). (My apologies if you've already reported that.)

Best,
  John

When i ran my code iwith pbmclapply, I did not compile my code. So I do presume that the speed up must in some way connected to this "NeedsCompilation" field. Any thoughts on that?

*Dear Experts,*
*Greetings from Pakistan*.
*When I run the following code in R*
library(frequencyConnectedness)
library(readxl)
##Add data here##
Data <- read_excel("Data_oil_agri.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet1")
Data <- Data[,2:22]
Data=na.omit(Data)
Bnames=colnames(Data)

lags=VARselect(Data, lag.max = 12, type = "const")  ## "const", "trend",
"both", "none"
p=lags$selection[[3]]

est <- VAR(Data, p = p, type = "const")
sp <- spilloverDY12(est, n.ahead = 10, no.corr = F)

params_est = list(p = p, type = "const")
sp_roll <- spilloverRollingDY12(Data, n.ahead = 10, no.corr = F, "VAR",
params_est = params_est, window = 260)
bounds <- c(pi+0.00001, pi/5, 0)
sp_bk <- spilloverBK12(est, n.ahead = 100, no.corr = F, partition = bounds)

sp_bk_roll <- spilloverRollingBK12(Data, n.ahead = 100, no.corr = F,
func_est = "VAR", params_est = params_est, window = 260, partition = bounds)

**Till now the code works well. After that, when I run the following:*

con      = as.matrix(read_excel("DY_Table.xlsx")[,-1])*100

*I face the following error:*
*Error in* *`vectbl_as_col_location()`:*
! Can't negate columns past the end.
? Location 1 doesn't exist.
? There are only 0 columns.
Run `rlang::last_error()` to see where the error occurred.

Kindly please guide me.

Colleagues,
I am plotting tolerance ratios by location and dateMy reproducible code is:
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)

# tolerance ratio 
day1 <- runif(3)
day2 <- runif(3)
day3 <-runif(3)
location <- c("A","B","C")

df <- data.frame(location,day1,day2,day3)

# plot of tolerance ratio by location and day
myplot <-ggplot(df,aes(location,day1))+geom_point()+
? geom_point(aes(location,day2))+
? ylab("Tolerance ratio")+
? xlab("Location")+
? theme_cowplot()+
? ggtitle("Tolerance ratio by location and day")
I need to shade the areas between the following y data

Tolerance
Ratio > 0.6??? ????????????????????area shaded = red??? ????Unacceptable
0.3 <= Ratio <= 0.6?????? ????light red???????????????????? Inadequate
0.25 <= Ratio < 0.3??????? ????yellow?????????????????????? Marginal0.2 <= Ratio < 0.25??????? ????light green???????????????? Good
Ratio < 0.2?????????????????????? ????green??????????????????????? Great
I believe that using geom_ribbon may work for this.
Any suggestions for this would be appreciated.
All the best,
Thomas Subia

Dear members,
                         I have the following code:

testprint <- function() {

  for(i in 1:5) {for(j in 1:5)
  {cat(j)}
    print(i)}
}

And the output is:

> testprint()
12345[1] 1
12345[1] 2
12345[1] 3
12345[1] 4
12345[1] 5

Any idea on how to remove the [1] from the output, and give spaces in the cat output? The desired output is:

1 2 3 4 5      1
1 2 3 4 5      2
1 2 3 4 5      3
1 2 3 4 5      4
1 2 3 4 5      5
 Many thanks in advance.....

Dear David,
                    THe code given was a reprex, and unfortunately, I cannot skip the for loops: Its a very big  web scraping code. Any alternative?

Many thanks in advance...

1 2 3 4 5      2
1 2 3 4 5      3
1 2 3 4 5      4
1 2 3 4 5      5
 Many thanks in advance.....

THanking you,

I'm not sure if geom_ribbon works with categorical data. It didn't
work for me, so I have coded location as a numeric, which works. You
can then manuall re-label the tick marks, as per the code below.
Others may be able to add to the code to add a legend, or propose a
different solution altogether, which may involve having to restructure
your data frame (I'm not an expert in R/ ggplot).

Below is some code. It's not elegant, but it seems to do at least part
of the job...

# tolerance ratio
day1 <- runif(3)
day2 <- runif(3)
day3 <-runif(3)
location <- c(1,2,3)

df <- data.frame(location,day1,day2,day3)
max <- 1.0  # find the maximum y-value in your data. Here, I've
assigned 1 for ease
ggplot()+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = 0.199999999, x = location), fill = "green") +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0.2, ymax = 0.249999999, x = location), fill
= "light green") +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0.25, ymax = 0.299999999, x = location), fill
= "yellow") +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0.3, ymax = 0.6, x = location), fill =
"orange") +   # "light red " is not recognised as a colour
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0.6000001, ymax = max, x = location), fill = "red") +
  geom_point(data = df, aes(location, day1))+
  geom_point(aes(location,day2))+
   scale_x_discrete(limits=c("A","B","C"))+
  ylab("Tolerance ratio")+
  xlab("Location")+
  ggtitle("Tolerance ratio by location and day")


Hope this provides at least a start!

Here is an alternative that makes a dataframe and then prints the dataframe.
n_rows <- 5
n_cols <- 5
p_mat<-matrix(0,nrow=n_rows,ncol=n_cols)
for(i in 1:n_rows) {
  for(j in 1:n_cols){

  }
}
p_df <- data.frame(p_mat,1:n_rows)
print(p_df)

This is a mailing list whose members are random people with an interest in R. We are not a tech support call center. If we have time, and you invest some effort into making it easier for us to reproduce your problem, then someone may respond... but no guarantees. Your current efforts are missing key elements that impede our efforts and there isn't much here to persuade many people to dig further. You may garner more responses if you make the following changes to your approach:

1) Make your example reproducible. We need access to the data you are working with, or at least a small fake similar data set. We don't have your Excel files... dead end for us. But see next point about files. Also, verify that your code can start from a fresh R environment and demonstrate your problem... the reprex package may be useful for this.

2) Make your example minimal. If you are having trouble with data importing, give us the data file or something similar that gives you the same error. If you are having trouble with data calculations or manipulations, then use dput [1] to give us a snippet of the data you are referring to in the troublesome line of code... don't give us a data file and a bunch of code that isn't giving you trouble before the error code... we don't want to wade through it.

3) Remove garbage from your posts (formatting). Look at the extra asterisks in your message as we see it [2]. We cannot run this code without guessing which symbols belong and which don't. I know you did not put them there intentionally, but neither did you disable HTML formatting in your email client when you composed the message, and that was responsible for the extra mess. The Posting Guide warns you to post plain text, and there are way too many email client programs out there for us to be able to tell you how to alter this setting... but it is essential that you do it if you want to encourage responses here.

I considered not responding at all due to these deficiencies, but figured I would spell out the problems you have missed in the Posting Guide once. Mailing lists are tough ways to get help... but the expertise here is kind of rare. You decide whether to make things easy or hard for yourself.

As for the "con =" line below, it seems to have nothing at all to do with the code or data referred to earlier. That would be a hint for point 2 above. Try calling the read_excel function alone without the rest of the indexing and matrix conversion. Only when the result you get from that step makes sense should you try indexing it or converting it. Maybe you need a "sheet=" argument?

Here is an alternative without for loops

n_rows <- 5
n_cols <- 5
p_df <- data.frame(matrix( rep(1:n_rows, n_cols), nrow=n_rows, byrow=TRUE), line_n=1:n_rows)
print(p_df)


If n_rows always equals n_cols then you could combine the first two lines

n_rows <- n_cols <- 5
p_df <- data.frame(matrix( rep(1:n_rows, n_cols), nrow=n_rows, byrow=TRUE), line_n=1:n_rows)
n_cols <- n_cols+1
print(p_df)

You might also notice that as.numeric(rownames(p_df)) returns the same values as line_n.

Here is an alternative that makes a dataframe and then prints the dataframe.
n_rows <- 5
n_cols <- 5
p_mat<-matrix(0,nrow=n_rows,ncol=n_cols)
for(i in 1:n_rows) {
  for(j in 1:n_cols){
    p_mat[i,j]<-(j)
  }
}
p_df <- data.frame(p_mat,1:n_rows)
print(p_df)

Dear David,
                    THe code given was a reprex, and unfortunately, I cannot skip the for loops: Its a very big  web scraping code. Any alternative?

Many thanks in advance...

Skip the for loops:

cat(paste( seq(1:5), ?    ?, 1:5) )

Message-ID: <PU4P216MB1568885A7CD531D6620DC8CDC8849@PU4P216MB1568.KORP216.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear members,
                         I have OHLC data of 500 stocks: OHLCData and dates. These are of xts object. I want to do the following:


  1.  I want to remove a contiguous set of dates from the xts object. for example, I want to remove data from the OHLC data from "2022-20-7"
  2.   to "2018-2-2", continuously.
  3.

       2. I want to remove a set of dates, which are not contiguous.

Any idea on how to accomplish it? I can write an intricate for loop, but any other method? Does an xts object behave like an atomic vector : OHLCData[[i]][-dates[[i]]] ?

Many thanks in advance....

THanking you,
Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

Look at the examples at the end of ?xts for more info.

  library(quantmod)
  getSymbols("AAPL")

  class(AAPL)
  ## [1] "xts" "zoo"

  range(time(AAPL))
  ## [1] "2007-01-03" "2022-07-08"

  # everything up to indicated date
  a1 <- AAPL["/2018-02-01"]

  # remove non consecutive dates
  d <- as.Date(c("2022-07-01", "2022-07-06")) # dates to remove
  a2 <- AAPL[ ! time(AAPL) %in% d ]

Dear, Below, jj contains character strings starting with ?z.? and ?x.?. 
I want to grep all that contain either ?z.? or ?x.?. I had to grep ?z.? 
and ?x.? separately and then tack the result together. Is there a 
convenient grep option that would grep strings with either ?z.? or ?x.?. 
Thank you!

Thanks Jeff. It works. If there is a good reference I should read 
(besides ? grep) I's be glad to have it.

?regex is a nice starting point, it's got plenty of details on meta
characters and characters classes, if you need more advanced stuff you'll
probably have to look at the perl regex documentation, I believe it's
linked in ?regex.

I might try something like

grep("^[xz]\\.")

or

grep("^[xz][.]")

or if you'd consider a different function,

startsWith(jj, "x.") | startsWith(jj, "z.")

Dear Steven,

Beyond ?regex, the Wikipedia article on regular expressions 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression> is quite helpful and 
not too long.

I hope this helps,
  John

1) Thank you for trying to be respectful, but calling me a professor is not a good way to do that. I have no PhD, nor do I work for a university. A simple "Jeff" or if you prefer "Mr. Newmiller" will be fine 

2) Because you replied to me, I can see your file, but no-one else on the list can... most attachments are removed by the mailing list. Do read the Posting Guide and try to embed data with dput rather than attaching things. Again, you limit the number of people who can help you by failing to use the list properly.

3) The name of the file you attached suggests that this is not the one that was causing you trouble. Your code references two different filenames.

Dear Jeff,
1) Being a PhD student, I am obliged to pay deep homage to all experts like
you on this forum who provide free knowledge.

2) Since the data is too large and I cannot cut it, I have no other
suitable option to send my full data.

3) This is the same file that I used in the codes mentioned in my
first email. The codes work well while using the data file I sent you till
this code line:

*sp_bk_roll <- spilloverRollingBK12(Data, n.ahead = 100, no.corr = F,
func_est = "VAR", params_est = params_est, window = 260, partition =
bounds)*

**Till now the code works well. After that, when I run the following:*

con      = as.matrix(read_excel("DY_Table.xlsx")[,-1])*100

*I face the following error:*
*Error in* *`vectbl_as_col_location()`:*
! Can't negate columns past the end.
? Location 1 doesn't exist.
? There are only 0 columns.
Run `rlang::last_error()` to see where the error occurred.

Now kindly check my issue.

Regards
Chishti

I am sure if Jeff Newmiller is a Professor, he may well be respected but he has not said he is nor most of us. He specifically said the people here are random people with an interest in R. A few may indeed be professors or once taught? like I did ages ago but few of us relate particularly to be called an honorific and unlike in some cultures, many simply get a bit annoyed at such phrases and some move on and won't reply.

May I suggest that on this forum, we appreciate it is some asks a properly formatted question which shows attempts to solve the problem and supplies a minimum of details with NONE of the details in an attached file which we will not see even if sent repeatedly.

I think you may have received replies and have not followed through on them.

Let me try ONCE, and if a reply refers to me being a professor I will just press DELETE and go on with my life.

Your error message seems clear. It says that what you asked for has NO columns.?


Did you type what it asked for IMMEDIATELY??

rlang::last_error()

The above might return MORE INFO and you have not shared that here. Is it possible it would have been helpful?

Now consider NOT running complex code in one long line when trying to see what failed. This line is too complex:

as.matrix(read_excel("DY_Table.xlsx")[,-1])*100


Try this:

temp <-?read_excel("DY_Table.xlsx")

See what it returns If the file exists in the current directory/folder and is spelled exactly that way and has only one tab, maybe it does.?But if that fails, DEBUG that before moving on. You need to look at temp and see if it is a valid data.frame.

So ONLY if it looks OK, do you move on to the next idea. What do you think temp[, -1] means??Your code seems to want all rows kept and I think the you want the FIRST column removed, leaving all the rest.?Note if the data only has ONE column, you are left with no columns. If the data already is empty or nonsense,trying to do the [, -1] indexing will fail, perhaps with that complaint.
So, if the above still worked as in you typed head(temp[, -1]) then continue, else go FIX what you already have till it works.

You now seem to want to change a data.frame into a matrix. Note that will really only work if everything is numeric. I mean?if it has any character data, everything will be character and probably not useful.?
So these two lines let you examine:
temp <- temp[, -1]

temp <- as.matrix(temp)

Any error messages so far? I highly doubt the next line generates that message, but as noted, the contents better be numeric.

temp <- temp * 100

When you get all those steps working, feel free to resume your original code:

con? ? ? = as.matrix(read_excel("DY_Table.xlsx")[,-1])*100


Just FYI, although "=" is a legal use in that line, many people use "<-" when writing in R.

And note again, we have no idea what is in what you call a DATA file except that a file whose name?ends in .XSLX is not what we think of as a data file. It is a newer format for an EXCEL SPREADSHEET?as compared to a .CSV file that has simpler comma separated values in a text compatible file. To read data?from EXCEL is much more complex and you may need to tell it which of the tabbed sheets to use and where?in that sheet to look for data. It often makes a good guess of looking at the first sheet and if it finds what looks?like columns of data and NOTHING ELSE on that sheet, brings it in. Chances are your data is not set up?for that default and you have several options. One is to open the file in EXCEL and clean it so it fits, and another?is to save a sheet, or a region, as a new .CSV file and change your code to use a function like read.csv() with?appropriate options.

Again, politeness here is wasted and volunteers have no obligation to you. If the above is helpful, great. If not,so be it. Ask your actual Professor who presumably will love being respected and speak your language well?and be able to see your data.

Cultures differ and we can put up with it but the feedback you get is that plenty of parts of the wider?world are not like Pakistan. We simply do not invent honorifics for people who we do not know for sure?has earned them, and even then, many people do not want or need a title used when not in that job but?just here helping out. If you want to keep calling us Professors, feel free. You have been notified many of?us are not impressed and may act accordingly. I know people with more than one Doctorate who do not?feel any need to use the titles.


But enough of that. Your level of understanding what you are doing is a bigger issue as you may?not know enough to be easy to help. My guess is you got some code from someone and are trying?to adapt it without knowing much. That works sometimes but maybe not now.

Anyone there can probably show you how to NOT SEND a huge EXCEL file because your problem probably?will happen if you make a copy of your file and edit it and save just the first few rows and toss the rest. If you?did that and your code still failed, you could cut and paste a small sample of the data, or even better do as?Jeff suggested, albeit in this case, he needs to consider that if you are not reading in the data properly, how?can you use dput() on an in-memory data structure and send us the output.


As Jeff pointed out, the part of your code you shared looked at two files and I assumed the error you reported?was only for the second. But did you notice for the other file you did it in steps:

Data <- read_excel("Data_oil_agri.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet1")

You specifically asked for Sheet1 and the second time did not. Does that matter? Maybe not. But it is not consistent.?You also removed the first column from that file another way:

Data <- Data[,2:22]


Just FYI, there is an easier way to remove a column by setting it to NULL as in

Data$ColNAME <- NULL? # if you know the name of the column

or: Data[,1] <- NULL
You do not need to know how many columns you have BUT the above only works if you properly?have read in something. Your code for the other file probably did not read it in properly.
I suggest again making your code more like the above rather than one long complex one,?so you can catch where it broke. My guess is earlier before you asked it to remove a?non-existent column.

Dear Jeff,
1) Being a PhD student, I am obliged to pay deep homage to all experts like
you on this forum who provide free knowledge.

2) Since the data is too large and I cannot cut it, I have no other
suitable option to send my full data.

3) This is the same file that I used in the codes mentioned in my
first email. The codes work well while using the data file I sent you till
this code line:

*sp_bk_roll <- spilloverRollingBK12(Data, n.ahead = 100, no.corr = F,
func_est = "VAR", params_est = params_est, window = 260, partition =
bounds)*

**Till now the code works well. After that, when I run the following:*

con? ? ? = as.matrix(read_excel("DY_Table.xlsx")[,-1])*100

*I face the following error:*
*Error in* *`vectbl_as_col_location()`:*
! Can't negate columns past the end.
? Location 1 doesn't exist.
? There are only 0 columns.
Run `rlang::last_error()` to see where the error occurred.

Now kindly check my issue.

Regards
Chishti

It means that the probability of an outcome less than or equal to 0.10 is 0.6. 

0 is the only possible such outcome but that is not a problem for the definition, and it is fairly common to use cumulative distribution functions for discrete outcomes defined as right-continuous step functions on the real line.

(1) Your sample code refers to a file DY_Table.xlsx
    but the file you attached to a later message is
    called Data_oil_agri.xlsx and I find it hard to
    believe that they are the same file.

(2) gmail offered me two different ways to download
    the file, but neither of them worked.  Fortunately,
    the third way worked.

(3) Here's what I get with Data_oil_agri.xlsx
> d<-read_excel("Data_oil_agri.xlsx", sheet=1)
> str(d)

tibble [3,870 x 22] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
    So that's a table with 3870 rows and 22 columns.
    But your code got this error message:
! Can't negate columns past the end.
? Location 1 doesn't exist.
? There are only 0 columns.
Run `rlang::last_error()` to see where the error occurred.
    This is why I wonder if you really sent the right file.

    The error message told you to do something.
    WHAT DID YOU SEE WHEN YOU ENTERED THE COMMAND
    rlang::last_error()
    ?
When you are reading from an .xls or .xlsx file, it is always
a good idea to be explicit about which sheet you want.

In another message, you wrote something that seems very strange.
"Since the data is too large and I cannot cut it".
It's an Excel spreadsheet!  (Or rather, three sheets.)
OF COURSE YOU CAN CUT IT!  That's like saying
"Because this banana is on my plate and I have a knife,
 I cannot cut it."
If you do not have Excel (and why would you?  I don't myself)
you could use LibreOffice or Google Sheets or WPS Office
or even Python
https://stackabuse.com/reading-and-writing-excel-files-in-python-with-the-pandas-library/
Libre Office and Google Sheets have worked well for me.

These things you must do.
(A) Check that DY_Table.xlsx and Data_oil_agri.xlsx
    are the same.  If they are not, make sure you are
    using the right one.
(B) Open the file in a spreadsheet program and see
    what is actually there.  Write down on a piece of
    paper how many sheets there are, what the sheet
    you want is called, and how many rows and columns it has.
    What are the first few columns called?
(C) Start up a fresh R session and use read_excel to read
    the right sheet from the right file.
    Use head() on the result.  Does it have the right
    number of columns?  Do they have the right names?
    Does the result have the right number of rows?
(D) Try the rest of the failing line.
    x <- as.matrix(the.tibble[,-1])*100
(E) If anything goes wrong, DO WHAT THE ERROR MESSAGE SAYS
    TO DO.

Got that?

By the way, I'm old school.  I love the assignment arrow <-
and find the abuse of "=" confusing and ugly.  But you just
taught me that there is something even uglier and more
confusing, and that's randomly switching between them.  Pick
one and stick to it.

Oh yeah, one final point.  The line where you say your code
has trouble doesn't seem to be connected in any way to the
preceding lines.  We didn't need to see them.

Subject: [R] Cairo does not work on install of R 4.2.0 from source
Message-ID: <7d83fa41-abc3-45d9-7beb-90d52a9c63dc@kleinholdermann.de>

Dear R community

I'm running R on Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-121-generic 
x86_64). The standard install was R version 3.6.3 which I kept and where 
all my graphics tasks work fine. Now, since I needed some packages which 
don't work with this version of R, I installed R version 4.2.0 into /opt 
from source using checkinstall. With this version of R graphics using 
the normal "plot" command still get displayed, although with a different 
font as in R 3.6.3 (more coarse and monotype-ish, I'd say). When I want 
to save the plot using grDevices::savePlot however I get the folloing error:

Error in grDevices::savePlot("tmp.png") :
 ? can only copy from 'X11(type="*cairo")' devices

As I said, both versions of R are installed on the same machine, thus 
the necessary libraries should be available, I think. Can someone point 
me to the background of the problem?

Thanks a lot!

Urs

See the configure.log. You do have the necessary libraries but not the
header files (in the lib*-dev packages) required to compile code to be
linked against them.

Does it help if you `sudo apt build-dep r-base` before compiling R from
source?

I want to split my dataframe according to a list of factors.  Then, in

it possible?

Thanks,
Naresh

mydf <- data.frame(

profit = round(runif(40, 2, 5), 2), sale = round(runif(40, 10, 20), 2))

account.names <- data.frame(account = c("ABC", "DEF", "XYZ"),

mydf.split <- split(mydf, mydf$account)

# This does not work
myplots <- lapply(mydf.split, function(df) {

xyplot(sale ~ date, data = myts, main = unique(myts$corp))})

# Now I can print one plot at a time
myplots[["ABC"]]
myplots[["XYZ"]]

Dear Respected Sir,
My exact question is how to develop "DY_Table.xlsx" for the following code:
(While considering [,-1])*100)
con      = as.matrix(read_excel("DY_Table.xlsx")[,-1])*100
I asked that code writer about it, he just reply to write the table. So, I
need to know how to write the table for the code mentioned above?
I hope that you got my question now.

Regards
Chishti

ARGH!
Now I understand less than ever!
Previously you said that you HAD a file and that
you got an error message when you tried to read
and process it.  You showed us the line of code.
You sent us what was supposed to be a copy of the file!

Now you say that
 - is not your code
 - the person who did write the code told you
   "just write the table"
 - you want us to tell you how to write the table.

Nobody is paying me for my time.  In fact if I hadn't
had to run the dishes through the dishwasher a second
time I wouldn't even be awake to do it.

We do not even know
 - what the code is supposed to do
 - what information is supposed to be in the table
 - what table you are actually talking about
   * is it the one of the sheets in the XLSX file?
   * is it the tibble that read_excel creates?
 - what you mean by "write the table"

It sounds as though there is someone well placed to help
you who refuses to do so.  Actually, there is someone
else who can help you, and does not seem to be interested
in doing so, and that is you yourself.  I gave you a list
of things to do.  Did you do them?

Hi,

The grouping variable is removed from the subgroups when you split.
Instead of iterating over the elements of the split list, you can
iterate over the **names** of the elements.  In your case the account
name is the grouping variable.


##start

library(lattice)
mydf <- data.frame(
  date = rep(seq.Date(from = as.Date("2022-06-01"), by = 1, length.out =
                        10), 4),
  account = c(rep("ABC", 20), rep("XYZ", 20)),
  client = c(rep("P", 10), rep("Q", 10), rep("R", 10), rep("S", 10)),
  profit = round(runif(40, 2, 5), 2), sale = round(runif(40, 10, 20), 2))

account.names <- data.frame(account = c("ABC", "DEF", "XYZ"),
                            corp = c("ABC Corporation", "DEF LLC",
"XYZ Incorporated"))

mydf.split <- split(mydf, mydf$account)

myplots <- sapply(names(mydf.split),
  function(name, x = NULL) {
    df <- x[[name]]
    myts <- aggregate(sale ~ date, FUN = sum, data = df)
    xyplot(sale ~ date, data = myts, main = name)
  }, x = mydf.split, USE.NAMES = TRUE, simplify = FALSE)

myplots[["ABC"]]
myplots[["XYZ"]]

## end

Does that help?

Dear members,
                         I have OHLC data of 500 stocks: OHLCData and dates. These are of xts object. I want to do the following:


  1.  I want to remove a contiguous set of dates from the xts object. for example, I want to remove data from the OHLC data from "2022-20-7"
  2.   to "2018-2-2", continuously.
  3.

       2. I want to remove a set of dates, which are not contiguous.

Any idea on how to accomplish it? I can write an intricate for loop, but any other method? Does an xts object behave like an atomic vector : OHLCData[[i]][-dates[[i]]] ?

Many thanks in advance....

THanking you,
Yours sincerely,

Look at the examples at the end of ?xts for more info.

  library(quantmod)
  getSymbols("AAPL")

  class(AAPL)
  ## [1] "xts" "zoo"

  range(time(AAPL))
  ## [1] "2007-01-03" "2022-07-08"

  # everything up to indicated date
  a1 <- AAPL["/2018-02-01"]

  # remove non consecutive dates
  d <- as.Date(c("2022-07-01", "2022-07-06")) # dates to remove
  a2 <- AAPL[ ! time(AAPL) %in% d ]

Subject: [R] Does the function "c" have a character limit?
Message-ID: <61a4af67-18a8-f363-8068-54fd1bc4d53d@gmail.com>

To Whom it May Concern,

I am creating a vector with the base R function "c", with many arguments 
as shown below:

 ???? +

For some reason, the R console does not display a ">" symbol, indicating 
that it has completed the function, but displays a "+" symbol instead, 
which indicates that the function is still waiting for more input. 
However, I believe that my syntax is correct. If I shorten my command by 
a few characters by removing the last entry, "TJP1":

 ???? >

The function now works, and returns a ">" symbol, indicating that the 
function completed successfully. The ls() function proves it:

 ???? $ R
 ???? > ls()
 ???? [1] "MES"

Is this a bug in the base R "c" function? It seems like the "c" function 
can only accept so many characters before it fails.

Thank you for your time,

I think the restriction is not specific to `c` but rather is a limitation on the length of expressions. My foggy memory is that the limit is in the 450-500 character vicinity. Pretty sure it?s been discussed here in the past.

Cannot reproduce this either with my R 4.2.1 on Linux. Just copy-pasted 
your expression and it works just fine.

Subject: [R] Does the function "c" have a character limit?
In-Reply-To: <61a4af67-18a8-f363-8068-54fd1bc4d53d@gmail.com>

Hello,

This is documented behavior.
 From R-intro, last line of section 1.8 [1].


Command lines entered at the console are limited4 to about 4095 bytes 
(not characters).


The number 4 in limited4 is a footnote link:


some of the consoles will not allow you to enter more, and amongst those 
which do some will silently discard the excess and some will use it as 
the start of the next line.



Prof. Ripley called the r-devel mailing list's attention to this in 
August 2006 when the limit was 1024 [2], it was then increased to the 
current 4095. I remember seeing a limit of 2048 (?) but couldn't find where.


Try creating a file with your command as only content, then run


x <- readLines("rhelp.txt")
nchar(x)
# [1] 4096


You are above the limit by 1 byte.
Standard solutions are to break the command line, in your case into at 
least 2 lines, or to source the command from file, like David proposed.

Hope this helps,

The limits to the size of vectors, matrices, data frames, lists, or other data structure does not have a simple answer.
1) 2^31 - 1  is the maximum number of rows. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5233769/practical-limits-of-r-data-frame#:~:text=The%20number%20is%202%5E31,start%20collecting%20several%20of%20them.
2) help(Memory) suggests that the default limit for all variables is 6 Mb. The help page tells you how to change this.
Neither of these two factors have any bearing on this problem except that your vector is not close to these limits.

I got the same result you did when I entered your vector into my system (R 4.2 in RStudio, on 64 bit Windows). I shortened it by removing the first entry and it works.

I can copy the entire line into Microsoft Word, and count the number of characters (including spaces) and I get 4089. There were seven characters in the first entry including the comma and space. If I add seven spaces between MES and the equal sign I get the original outcome. So the limit is on the number of characters in the line. You can get more entries by shortening each entry, or fewer if each entry was longer.

As others have suggested, I would break the line into two pieces and then combine the pieces.

[External Email]

Hello,

This is documented behavior.
 From R-intro, last line of section 1.8 [1].


Command lines entered at the console are limited4 to about 4095 bytes (not characters).


The number 4 in limited4 is a footnote link:


some of the consoles will not allow you to enter more, and amongst those which do some will silently discard the excess and some will use it as the start of the next line.



Prof. Ripley called the r-devel mailing list's attention to this in August 2006 when the limit was 1024 [2], it was then increased to the current 4095. I remember seeing a limit of 2048 (?) but couldn't find where.


Try creating a file with your command as only content, then run


x <- readLines("rhelp.txt")
nchar(x)
# [1] 4096


You are above the limit by 1 byte.
Standard solutions are to break the command line, in your case into at least 2 lines, or to source the command from file, like David proposed.

Subject: [R] How to parse a really silly date with lubridate
Message-ID: <tami12$11b8$1@ciao.gmane.io>


Hi,

I have data file which generated by an otherwise very nice (diabetes
log) app, but exports dates really silly.

After reading the enclosed mwe.csv into R like so

	 MWE <- read_delim('mwe.csv', delim = ';') %>%
		select(Date) %>%
		print()


this comes out as:

	 # A tibble: 2 ? 1
	Date
	<chr>
	 1 9. Jul 2022 at 11:39
	 2 10. Jul 2022 at 01:58


No matter what I try I am not able to parse this inside R to get at
proper dates (I have loaded tidyverse and lubridate).

I can easily do somethig

	 csvq  -d ';' -t '%e. %b %Y at %H:%i' \
		'SELECT Date as oridate,
			DATETIME_FORMAT(Date, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%m") AS date
		FROM mwe'

	 +-----------------------+------------------+
	 |        oridate        |       date       |
	 +-----------------------+------------------+
	 | 9. Jul 2022 at 11:39  | 2022-07-09 11:07 |
	 | 10. Jul 2022 at 01:58 | 2022-07-10 01:07 |
	 +-----------------------+------------------+

and hence could easily do something like

	 csvq  -d ';' -t '%e. %b %Y at %H:%i' \
	  'ALTER mwe
	  SET Date = DATETIME_FORMAT(Date, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%m")'

but would rather like to be able to do it inside R and would therefor
appreciate any advice in this regard.

Breaking up the *line* doesn't mean breaking up the *command*.
For example,
x <- c(
    "FOOBAR", # 1
    ...
    "FOOBAR", # 4999
    "UGGLE")
works fine, with source(..), with "R -f ...", and other ways.
Each *line* is short, but it's still one *command*.

I'd probably put that much data in a file, myself,
but R doesn't mind.

Don't know about lubridate, but the following seems to work:

Sys.setlocale('LC_TIME', 'C')
strptime(
 c('9. Jul 2022 at 11:39', '10. Jul 2022 at 01:58'),
 '%d. %b %Y at %H:%M'
)

(Use Sys.getlocale() and on.exit() to restore the previous locale
state if you need it.)

Does this do the trick?

s = c("9. Jul 2022 at 11:39", "10. Jul 2022 at 01:58")
as.POSIXct(s, format = "%d. %b %Y at %H:%M")
as.POSIXct(s, format = "%d. %b %Y at %H:%M", tz = "UTC")

Hello,

The original command has spaces in it. If they are removed its total 
length goes down to 3649 bytes (or characters, in this case it's the 
same). With this length the command is expected to work without further 
worries. And it does, I have just tried it.

Subject: [R] How to parse a really silly date with lubridate

Hello,

With lubridate, note in what sequence your datetime elements occur and 
use the appropriate function.


d <- c('9. Jul 2022 at 11:39', '10. Jul 2022 at 01:58')
lubridate::dmy_hm(d)
#> [1] "2022-07-09 11:39:00 UTC" "2022-07-10 01:58:00 UTC"


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Subject: [R] Does the function "c" have a character limit?
In-Reply-To: <BN6PR2201MB155355656C6FD9DC0BD729C1CF899@BN6PR2201MB1553.namprd22.prod.outlook.com>

If I follow this thread, it looks clear that the problem is superficial and not really about the c() function as it is below sea level.

Is this also a problem if you replace c() with max () or list() as I think it may be? Then it is more about what length the interpreter is able to handle everywhere or on your installation or memory constraints.

There are, of course, lots of ways to work around it and some have been mentioned, as you clearly have data.frames with underlying vectors that are millions of units long including with character data like yours.

I was able to reproduce your problem within RSTUDIO and noted the editor window actually cuts off the text and asks you to click to see more, which may be a hint. Have you tried a paste of this long thing directly to an R interpreter not through RSTUDIO?

I did an experiment and broke up the big monster that failed into multiple short lines and it works fine. It looks like a LINE LENGTH limit, not a statement limit.

So if your data was entered say like this:

MES=c(
  "A2M",
  "ABRACL",
  "ACADVL",
  "ACAP2",
  ...,
  "TIMP1",
  "TJP1"
  )

Then it should work for much larger amounts of data.

And, of course, you can enter multiple smaller units and concatenate them together in the code and remove the originals, as long as each unit was small enough. Reading the data in from a file also should bypass the issue if done right.

There is no reason every programmer should try to make everything a one-liner.

Subject: Re: [R] Does the function "c" have a character limit?

The limits to the size of vectors, matrices, data frames, lists, or other data structure does not have a simple answer.
1) 2^31 - 1  is the maximum number of rows. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5233769/practical-limits-of-r-data-frame#:~:text=The%20number%20is%202%5E31,start%20collecting%20several%20of%20them.
2) help(Memory) suggests that the default limit for all variables is 6 Mb. The help page tells you how to change this.
Neither of these two factors have any bearing on this problem except that your vector is not close to these limits.

I got the same result you did when I entered your vector into my system (R 4.2 in RStudio, on 64 bit Windows). I shortened it by removing the first entry and it works.

I can copy the entire line into Microsoft Word, and count the number of characters (including spaces) and I get 4089. There were seven characters in the first entry including the comma and space. If I add seven spaces between MES and the equal sign I get the original outcome. So the limit is on the number of characters in the line. You can get more entries by shortening each entry, or fewer if each entry was longer.

As others have suggested, I would break the line into two pieces and then combine the pieces.

[External Email]

Hello,

This is documented behavior.
 From R-intro, last line of section 1.8 [1].


Command lines entered at the console are limited4 to about 4095 bytes (not characters).


The number 4 in limited4 is a footnote link:


some of the consoles will not allow you to enter more, and amongst those which do some will silently discard the excess and some will use it as the start of the next line.



Prof. Ripley called the r-devel mailing list's attention to this in August 2006 when the limit was 1024 [2], it was then increased to the current 4095. I remember seeing a limit of 2048 (?) but couldn't find where.


Try creating a file with your command as only content, then run


x <- readLines("rhelp.txt")
nchar(x)
# [1] 4096


You are above the limit by 1 byte.
Standard solutions are to break the command line, in your case into at least 2 lines, or to source the command from file, like David proposed.

Eberhard,

Others have supplied ways to do this using various date management functions. But I want to add another option that may make sense if the dates are not all quite as predictable.

You can use your own regular expressions in R as in most languages, that try to match each entry to one or more patterns you supply. When it matches a pattern, you can capture various bits of what you find and recombine them into any valid date format you want or convert them into some date type.

You just showed two pseudo-date-time entries:

It looks like the first item in each is a sequence number that can be ignored. But I assume after the ninth, it takes up ever more space as it becomes 10 then 100 and so on. It would thus be of varying width. So, in English, you are looking for a pattern like:

- beginning of the line/entry
- one or more digits in 0-9 followed by what looks like a space, but maybe arbitrary whitespace.
- capture one or two more digits if followed by a period, but not the period.
- capture what looks like a three-letter character string representing a month as a "word" but not what follows.
- whitespace followed by "at" followed by more whitespace can be ignored but must be present.
- capture a two digit number perhaps including the colon and another two-digit number, or two parts without the colon.
- match the end of the entry

If it looks like the above, and you captured the parts needed, you can reconstitute the parts, albeit perhaps first checking to see if the month names are valid (which can be handled by a pattern part that looks like "(Jan|Feb|...|Dec)" and of course making sure the other parts also fit requirements such as days as integers being between 1 and 31 and similar issues about time. My guess is that you don't really want to validate that deeply, let alone do the validation within the regular expression.

But when your data ends up having multiple ways of saying the date that you can enumerate and tell apart, this can be a way to parse them and identify what it matches and so on.

In the above case, full regular expressions may be overkill nd regular string functions might suffice.  There are many ways, including something as simple as this:

dt <- "1 9. Jul 2022 at 11:39"
dt_parts <- strsplit(dt, " ")

Unfortunately, this returns a vector of parts with a decimal point still in place:

> dt_parts
[1] "1"     "9."    "Jul"   "2022"  "at"    "11:39"

You can now ignore  the parts in the first fifth positions as the sequence number and "at" are meaningless and use these:

the_day <- dt_parts[2]
the_month <- dt_parts[3]
the_year <- dt_parts[4]
the_time <- dt_parts[6]

Of course, you now may want further processing using one of many ways to turn something like "9." (note there may be a "12." too) or even make it an integer instead of a character string. You may want to change the dates into numerals with something like this:

month_conversion <- list("Jan"="01", Feb="02", Mar="03", Apr="04", May="05", Jun="06", 
                         Jul="07", Aug="08", Sep="09", Oct="10", Nov="11", Dec="12")
month_numeric_string <- month_conversion[the_month]


My point is that if your format is consistent, you can pick out the parts you want as strings or make them decimals or whatever you need and use string functions, such as paste0() to recombine them into the format you want. 

Of course if you can tell some date-related function how to do it for you, that is obviously simpler and better for you.

And, obviously, it would be even nicer if you could get them to not give dates in this format!

Subject: Re: [R] How to parse a really silly date with lubridate

Hello,

With lubridate, note in what sequence your datetime elements occur and use the appropriate function.


d <- c('9. Jul 2022 at 11:39', '10. Jul 2022 at 01:58')
lubridate::dmy_hm(d)
#> [1] "2022-07-09 11:39:00 UTC" "2022-07-10 01:58:00 UTC"


Hope this helps,

Message-ID: <PU4P216MB15682B367ABD8E231ECAA5A3C8899@PU4P216MB1568.KORP216.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear members,
                         I am running a large scraping code in a very powerful AWS ec2 instance:

DATES <- getFirms Dates()

It iterates over 500 stocks from a website. Despite the power of the machine, the execution is very slow.

If I abort the function (by ctrl + C), after, say 150th iteration, the DATES object will still contain the scraped data untill the 150th iteration, right? ( The rest of the 350 entries will be NA's, I suppose).

Many thanks in advance.....

Yours sincerely,
AKSHAY M KULKARNI

This would be easy for you to test on a small example on your local computer.

But the answer is "no". Nothing is assigned if the function does not return normally... and Ctrl+C is anything but normal.

You could write a function that returns an environment (or list if you
prefer) containing the results collected before the interrupt by using
tryCatch(interrupt=...).  E.g.,

doMany <- function(names) {
    resultEnv <- new.env(parent=emptyenv())
    tryCatch(
        for(name in names) resultEnv[[name]] <- Sys.sleep(1), # replace
Sys.sleep(1) by getStuffFromWeb(name)
        interrupt = function(e) NULL)
    resultEnv
}

Use it as

> system.time(e <- doMany(state.name)) # hit Esc or ^C after a few seconds
^C   user  system elapsed
  0.001   0.000   4.390
> names(e)
[1] "Alabama"  "Alaska"   "Arizona"  "Arkansas"
> eapply(e, identity)
$Alabama
NULL

$Alaska
NULL

$Arizona
NULL

$Arkansas
NULL

Thank you everyone for the help. It is interesting that R sets a 
character limit on each line, but I am glad the solution is simple.

Subject: [R] How to parse a really silly date with lubridate

Hi,

while all of the below work in a character vector, none works in
the tibble.

The following

	DDATA %>%
		add_column(as.tibble(lubridate::dmy_hm(DDATA$Date)),
			.before = "Period") %>%
		rename(NewDate=value) %>%
		select(Date,NewDate) %>%
		filter(between(as.Date(NewDate),as.Date('2022-07-09'),
			as.Date('2022-07-10')))

does work

	# A tibble: 3 ? 2
	  Date                  NewDate
	  <chr>                 <dttm>
	1 9. Jul 2022 at 11:39  2022-07-09 11:39:00
	2 10. Jul 2022 at 01:58 2022-07-10 01:58:00
	3 10. Jul 2022 at 11:26 2022-07-10 11:26:00

but I wonder if that can not be done more elegantly, ie by direct
replacements in the column.

greetings, el

Jeff & Akshay,

What you say is true if you just call a function and do not arrange to
handle various interrupts and errors.

Obviously if you find a way to gracefully handle an error then you can opt
to have your work so far saved. For what is meant to be a fatal error,
though, you are expected to GIVE UP or at least exit rapidly after doing
something graceful. 

I am not clear what machine the user is using and their R setup. It may be
you can find something like a try() or suspendInterrupts method to catch and
handle control-C but may I offer a DIFFERENT solution?

You can identify your R process and send it some other milder signal that
can easily be caught or change your loop to slow it down a bit more.

For example, change your code so it opens a file and writes data to it in
some format like one result per line or a CSV format or whatever makes you
happy. Your loop adds new lines/items to the file and perhaps even closes
the file on interrupt or whatever works. Or it writes the results to the
console where you can copy/paste from if not too long.

And, consider having long-running code periodically check something in the
environment looking for a signal. Say every hundredth iteration it checks
for the existence of a file called "STOP_IT.stupid" and if it sees it,
removes it and exits gracefully while preserving your results somehow or
whatever you need. No interrupt needed, just create an empty file or other
logical marker.

Another variant is to use some form of threading or subprocess that does the
work somewhat in the background but can get commands from the foreground
process as needed including a request to stop. Again, no horrible signals
that kill the program.

And note on some systems, a process can be halted and resumed, if the
problem is that it has run a long time and is using too many resources at a
time they are needed.

This would be easy for you to test on a small example on your local
computer.

But the answer is "no". Nothing is assigned if the function does not return
normally... and Ctrl+C is anything but normal.

Hello everyone,
Is there a mechanism to report a bug in someone package? I plan to email the author, but I was wondering if there is an official way like the issue function in github.
Thank you,

Not all packages are developed on github, and CRAN itself only supports the maintainer function. However, sometimes the package DESCRIPTION file (shown on the CRAN package details page) will point you to a version control website such as GitHub for communicating with the maintainer.

To be clear, Everything has limits beyond which it is not expected to have to deal with. Buffers often pick a fixed size and often need complex code to keep grabbing a bigger size and copy and add more, or arrange various methods to link multiple memory areas into a growing whole, such as having an object with a list of smaller parts that are concatenated only when requested.

Many languages likely have similar constraints and one method hackers have used is to arrange to overflow such buffers carefully.

Have you verified if the normal stand-alone R interpreter accepts a longer one-liner and the cause may in RSTUDIO or whatever else you are using?

I will say the current design is flawed in that it does NOT give you an error, but since only some of the line is passed to the functionality then it is waiting for something that closes up the command such as a close parenthesis, or if it stops in middle of a string, also a close quote.

So, as we have said, just don't do that, albeit it is not necessarily easy to avoid when you have no idea the length of your data will be so high.

Thank you everyone for the help. It is interesting that R sets a character limit on each line, but I am glad the solution is simple.

Subject: [R] How to parse a really silly date with lubridate

Hello,

Are you looking for mutate? In the example below I haven't included the 
filter, since the tibble only has 2 rows. But the date column is coerced 
to an actual datetime class in place, without the need for NewDate.

suppressPackageStartupMessages({
   library(tibble)
   library(dplyr)
})

DDATA <- tibble(Date = c('9. Jul 2022 at 11:39', '10. Jul 2022 at 01:58'))

DDATA %>%
   mutate(Date = lubridate::dmy_hm(Date))
#> # A tibble: 2 ? 1
#>   Date
#>   <dttm>
#> 1 2022-07-09 11:39:00
#> 2 2022-07-10 01:58:00


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

If this is in reference to a package on CRAN then go to its CRAN home page, for
example,

  https://cran.r-project.org/package=sqldf

and then look for a BugReports line on that page to find where to report bugs.

If there is no such line check the URL line and if it points to a
github URL then
use the issues on github.

Otherwise, send an email to the maintainer listed on the Maintainer line.
