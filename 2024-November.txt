Hi Aristide and welcome to R-help!

Your message was a bit mangled [*]. It's best to compose messages to
this mailing list in plain text. Otherwise (when composed in HTML), the
mailing list eats the HTML part and we're left with the plain text part

I can reproduce the problem:

library(gmm)
data(Finance)
r <- Finance[1:300, 1:10]                                              
rm <- Finance[1:300, "rm"]                             
rf <- Finance[1:300, "rf"]
z <- as.matrix(r-rf) 
zm <- rm-rf
res <- gmm(z ~ zm, x = ~ zm)
library(formula.tools)
gmm(z ~ zm, x = ~ zm) # signals an error

Looking at the traceback(), I see the formula being transformed into NA
~ NA at some point:

10: terms.formula(formula, data = data) # <-- error happens here
9: terms(formula, data = data)
8: model.frame.default(data = object$data, formula = NA ~ NA, drop.unused.levels = TRUE, 
       na.action = "na.pass")
7: model.frame(data = object$data, formula = NA ~ NA, drop.unused.levels = TRUE, 
       na.action = "na.pass") # <-- formula is already NA ~ NA here
6: eval(mfh, parent.frame())
5: eval(mfh, parent.frame())
4: getDat(object$g, object$x, data = object$data)
3: getModel.baseGmm(all_args, ...)
2: getModel(all_args, ...)
1: gmm(z ~ zm, x = ~zm)

It seems that in base R, as.character(z ~ zm) returns a three-element
character vector, while with formula.tools loaded, it only returns a
single string, 'z ~ zm'. This breaks formula manipulation in getDat().

An immediate workaround is to replace the method provided by
formula.tools with one that immediately delegates back to R:

.S3method('as.character', 'formula', function (x, ...) NextMethod())
gmm(z ~ zm, x = ~ zm) # seems to work once again

(Is there a way to truly unregister an S3 method?)

Perhaps gmm::getDat could be made more robust by working directly on
the formula/call object instead of going through the string
representation.

Subject: [R] foreSIGHT package
Message-ID: <0050F99A-A468-43BD-A9CD-B36AF05BD623@gmx.ch>

Dear community

I have started to use the foreSIGHT package fo calculate some climatic indicators.

Example
library(foreSIGHT)
func_avgDSD(WAAR$Ta, attArgs)

Dataset (WAAR, Ta = average daily temperature)
Year DOY Ta
1990 1 -2.45
1990 2 1.54
.
.
2001 1 4.54
,
2001 205 15.65
2001 206 20.14
.
2001 365 8.65
..
2023 1 0.45


Questions:
Is it possible to run the foreSIGHT with DOY numbers not dates (e.g. 1983-04-09 23.64) and additionally separate years? 
 
I have some problems to understand attArgs. Up to now I have not found any reference. How do I need to prepare the list? And where I can set the threshold?
 
Sometimes there are indicators without any definition of the threshold? E.g. cold seasons length: func_CSL (data) how is a cold day defined here (the threshold for cold days), there is no attArgs?

Many thanks 
Sibylle
