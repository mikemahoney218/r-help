I decided to do a direct comparison of transpose and sweep.


library(microbenchmark)

NN <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)  # Example matrix
lambda <- c(2, 3, 4)  # Example vector
colNN <- t(NN)

microbenchmark(
  sweep     = sweep(NN, 2, lambda, "/"),
  transpose = t(t(NN)/lambda),
  colNN     = colNN/lambda
)


Unit: nanoseconds
      expr   min    lq     mean median      uq   max neval cld
     sweep 13817 14145 15115.06  14350 14657.5 75932   100 a  
 transpose  1845  1927  2151.68   2132  2214.0  7093   100  b 
     colNN    82   123   141.86    123   164.0   492   100   c

Note that transpose is much faster than sweep because it is doing less work,
I believe essentially just changing the order of indexing.

Using the natural sequencing for column-ordered matrices is much much faster.

Dear Ivan,

Thank you very much for this interesting information.

Regarding:
"For well-behaved packages that declare their dependencies correctly,
parsing the NAMESPACE for importFrom() and import() calls should give
you the explicit imports."

I did learn something new (I am not very experienced in package writing). Unfortunately, Roxygen2 as of the current version still suggests to use the pkg::fname approach:
"If you are using just a few functions from another package, we recommending adding the package to the Imports: field of the DESCRIPTION file and calling the functions explicitly using ::, e.g., pkg::fun()."
https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/namespace.html

Regarding analysing the actual code: it is good to know that CMD check has also some functionality. I will look into it, when I find some free time.

tools:::.check_packages_used is a few pages of code. On the other hand, the help page for codetools::checkUsage is quite cryptic. But it's good to know at least where to look.

Sincerely,

Leonard

For well-behaved packages that declare their dependencies correctly,
parsing the NAMESPACE for importFrom() and import() calls should give
you the explicit imports. (What if the package imports the whole
dependency? The safe assumption is that all functions are used, but it
comes with false positives. You could also walk the package code
looking for function names that may belong to the imported package, but
that may involve both false positives and false negatives.)

For the rest of the imports and uses of weak dependencies, you'll have
to walk the package code looking for the uses of the `::` operator. See
how R CMD check walks the package code in functions
tools:::.check_packages_used and codetools::checkUsage.

A less-well-behaved package can always load a namespace during runtime
and choose the functions to call depending on the phase of the moon or
weather on Jupiter. For these, like for the halting problem, there's no
general solution: the package could be written to say, "if Leonard's
function says I'm about to call foo::bar, I won't do it, otherwise I
will".

I added two more rows

library(microbenchmark)

NN <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)  # Example matrix
lambda <- c(2, 3, 4)  # Example vector
colNN <- t(NN)
matlam <- matrix(lambda, byrow=TRUE, nrow=2, ncol=3)

microbenchmark(
  sweep     = sweep(NN, 2, lambda, "/"),
  transpose = t(t(NN)/lambda),
  colNN     = colNN/lambda,
  fullsize  = NN / matrix(lambda, byrow=TRUE, nrow=2, ncol=3),
  rowlam  = NN / matlam
)

Unit: nanoseconds
      expr   min    lq     mean  median      uq   max neval cld
     sweep 12546 12792 13919.91 12997.0 13325.0 85608   100 a
 transpose  1640  1763  1986.04  1947.5  2050.0  7462   100  b
     colNN    82    82   161.13   123.0   123.0  3854   100   c
  fullsize   738   820   932.34   881.5   963.5  2829   100  bc
    rowlam    82   123   168.92   164.0   164.0   820   100   c

reshaping the denominator to the correct size in advance is very helpful if you will be doing this division more than once.

Very interesting - thanks! Most of my problems are not limited by 
compute speed, but its clear that for some sorts of compute-intensive 
problems, sweep might be a limiting approach.

There are *vectors* and they belong to a vector space and that's it.
(and yes, arrays of a given rank and dimensions also are
 elements of a vector space, and hence matrices are, and then
 indeed, a 3x1 matrix and a 1x3 matrix are *not* members of the
 same vector space -- even though the two vector spaces are
 isomorphic to each other)

The matlab induced --> applied linear algebra / math
"column- and row-vectors"  have been convenient because then
everything is a matrix (or scalar), and that fits well with a
product called "matlab" which is short for "matrix lab(oratory)".
BUT they are  mathematically confusing and therefore in my view
very undesirable terminology.

I'm very very strongly with Jeff that "the only" consistent
language would be to call them 1-row matrix and 1-column matrix,
because that's what they are, well defined and perfect within 
the well defined math realm of linear algebra.

Yes, matrix-vector calculus , scalar products, bilinear forms, ...
can be generalized in such ways that 1-row matrices and 1-column
matrices can be treated equivalently to vectors and vice versa
.. and that is sometimes convenient. 

Still, the "column-vector"  and "row-vector"  terms have
lead to much confusion in my view,
because really  Nx1  or  1xM  are dimensions of matrices and
*not* of any vectors  ..

I agree. And that's good -- because "vectors are vectors" aka
"a rank-1 array is a rank-1 array is a rank-1 array" (Richard O'Keefe)

Message-ID: <ce1383d4-8339-47a3-b56c-11c4759e905a@sjd.es>

Hi all,

I tested next command:

gsub("([aeiouAEIOU])([aeiouAEIOU])", "\\1_\\2", "aerioue")

with the following output:

[1] "a_eri_ou_e"

So, there are two consecutive vowels where an underscore is not added.

May it be a bug? Is it expected (bug or not)? Is there any chance to get 
what I want (an underscore between each pair of consecutive vowels)?


Thank you!

Best regards,

Iago

Hi Iago,


This is not a bug. It is expected. Patterns may not overlap. However, there
is a way to get the result you want using perl:

```R
gsub("([aeiouAEIOU])(?=[aeiouAEIOU])", "\\1_", "aerioue", perl = TRUE)
```

The specific change I made is called a positive lookahead, you can read
more about it here:

https://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html

It's a way to check for a piece of text without consuming it in the match.

Also, since you don't care about character case, it might be more legible
to add ignore.case = TRUE and remove the upper case characters:

```R
gsub("([aeiou])(?=[aeiou])", "\\1_", "aerioue", perl = TRUE, ignore.case =
TRUE)

## or

gsub("(?i)([aeiou])(?=[aeiou])", "\\1_", "aerioue", perl = TRUE)
```

I hope this helps!

Curious to know if this warning is expected behavior, and if so, what is 
the recommended way instead:

     > dput(letters, file = stderr())
    c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l",
    "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y",
    "z")
    Warning message:
    In dput(letters, file = stderr()) : wrote too few characters

(I ask because it doesn't happen when using file = stdout())

Here's another *incorrect* way to do it -- incorrect because it will
not always work, unlike Iris's correct solution. But it does not
require PERL type matching. The idea: separate the two vowels in the
regex by a character that you know cannot appear (if there is such)
and match it optionally, e.g. with '*" repetition specifier. I used
"?" for the optional character below (which must be escaped).

Sounds like a bug.

This is where the warning is produced:

    int res = Rconn_printf(con, "%s\n", CHAR(STRING_ELT(tval, i)));
    if(!havewarned &&
       res < strlen(CHAR(STRING_ELT(tval, i))) + 1) {
	warning(_("wrote too few characters"));
	havewarned = TRUE;
    }

At this point, `res` is 0, and CHAR(STRING_ELT(tval, i)) is what you'd
expect:

(gdb) x /s (void*)(STRING_ELT(tval, i))+48
0x5555561bf0a8: "c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\",
\"h\", \"i\", \"j\", \"k\", \"l\", "

`res` is 0 because that's what (con->vfprintf)(...) returns:

2813    static int stderr_vfprintf(Rconnection con, const char *format, va_list ap)
2814    {
2815        REvprintf(format, ap);
2816        return 0;
2817    }

Why doesn't it warn for stdout()? Doesn't stdout_vfprintf(...) behave
the same? That's because stdout() (connection #1) is special for dput(),
and instead of going through the connection system, it goes straight for
Rprintf():

426         else { // ifile == 1 : "Stdout"
427             for (int i = 0; i < LENGTH(tval); i++)
428                 Rprintf("%s\n", CHAR(STRING_ELT(tval, i)));
429         }

Not sure what the right fix is. There may be code depending on
(con->vfprintf)(...) returning 0.

Ivan

This really is all LaTeX errors, not R errors. Both examples complain that pdftexcmds.sty is not installed. Most "sty" files are in LaTeX packages. Each LaTeX distribution has its own way to install packages ... but the difficulty is usually on the same order of difficulty as installing R packages from CRAN... that is, pretty easy. But you need to read about _your_ TeX system for details. I use Google to figure out which package has the given file in it... it is usually the same as whatever comes before ".sty", but not always.

Quick things first: have you installed all the build-dependencies? apt
build-dep r-base (maybe with --install-suggests? haven't tried that in
a while) should do that. In particular, the build dependencies include
texlive-fonts-extra and texlive-latex-extra. That's a lot of packages,
but some of them are required to compile LaTeX documents produced by R.

Can you compile a minimal LaTeX document? Something like:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\[ \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X} \beta \]
\end{document}

Does tools::texi2pdf('THISFILE.tex') fail with a similar error message?

The matrix equivalent of
  x <- ...
  v <- ...
  x[length(x)+1] <- v
is
  m <- ...
  r <- ...
  m <- rbind(m, r)
or
  m <- ...
  k <- ...
  m <- cbind(m, c)

A vector or matrix so constructed never has "holes" in it.
It's better to think of CONSTRUCTING vectors and matrices rather than
INITIALISING them,
because always being fully defined is important.

It would be really really helpful to have a clearer idea of what you
are trying to do.

On my system, pdftexcmds.sty can be found in
/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/generic/pdftexcmds/pdftexcmds.sty
A quick poking around with 'apt' and 'dpkg-query -L' told me that this
comes from the
texlive-latex-recommended
Ubuntu package.  So on my system, if I didn't already have this,
sudo apt install texlive-latex-recommended
should fix the problem.

Thank you Ivan and Richard...

Short version: a simple "sudo apt install texlive" fixed it.

Longer version (attempt at a post-mortem): previously (back on 
2023-11-05) on this same system I built R version 4.3.2; and 
/home/btyner/R432/lib/R/doc/NEWS.pdf does exist (and is a valid pdf with 
48 pages) from that same install. Likewise before that on 2023-07-02 I 
built R version 4.3.1 and the NEWS.pdf is fine (47 pages) there too.

Still not sure how it happened that my system lost track of the 
necessary texlive add-ons at some point between 2023-11-05 and now, but 
running "sudo apt install texlive" made it clear that 
texlive-latex-recommended was indeed one of the culprits as suggested by 
Richard.

    The following additional packages will be installed:
     ? fonts-texgyre tex-gyre texlive-fonts-recommended
    texlive-latex-recommended tipa
    Suggested packages:
     ? texlive-fonts-recommended-doc texlive-latex-recommended-doc
    texlive-luatex texlive-pstricks tipa-doc
    The following NEW packages will be installed:
     ? fonts-texgyre tex-gyre texlive texlive-fonts-recommended
    texlive-latex-recommended tipa

In an attempt to figure out what might have happened after 2023-11-05,

    zgrep texlive /var/log/dpkg.log.*.gz

revealed some texlive related activity back on 2023-11-23 but no

One more thing:

    HISTTIMEFORMAT="%Y-%m-%d %T " history | grep texlive

revealed that I ran "sudo apt install texlive-latex-base" back on 
2024-02-19, so maybe that had something to do with it. Sadly the shell 
history does not exist prior to that date.

"It would be really really helpful to have a clearer idea of what you
are trying to do."

Amen!

But in R, "constructing" objects by extending them piece by piece is
generally very inefficient (e.g.
https://r-craft.org/growing-objects-and-loop-memory-pre-allocation/),
although sometimes?/often? unavoidable (hence the relevance of your
comment above). R generally prefers to take a "whole object" point of
view ( see R books by Chambers, et. al.) and provides code for basic
operations like vector/matrix, etc. construction to do so. When this
is not possible, I suspect "optimal" efficient strategies for
allocating space to build objects gets you into the weeds of how R
works.

Cheers,
Bert

To be fair, these replies no longer include the original question, which was IMO really quite clear (if misguided), and was actually targeted at understanding pre-allocation for better performance. Richard's suggestion to store the along-the-way constructed vectors in a list and examine the lengths of the elements of that list after it is completely constructed if it is really desired to force vectors of varying lengths into a matrix seems appropriate. The possibly-misguided part is in the thought that vectors of different lengths belong in a matrix at all... leaving them in a list seems more likely to be appropriate.

OP: Avoid mis-using NA to "fill out" the end of uniform-length vectors. Each index position in a vector should represent some information... if you are throwing NAs or zeros in willy-nilly then you are not taking care to assign meaning to those positions, and likely wasting memory and time doing so. If you were taking such care, then any appropriate NAs would already be present in the vectors before you put them into the matrix, and the original question would not have crossed OPs mind because the vectors world already be of the same length. NA means that information for a specific position is "unknown", not "space filler".

Now if OP wants better guidance on restructuring their analysis, then certainly sharing those details would help the discussion move away from the original misguided question... but that would be another thread to answer the question that should have been asked.

Subject: [R] Default t test in R is Welch's test, not Student's,
 and can be very problematic
Message-ID: <AM7PR01MB662659E29C5A31B6C81D415FDC232@AM7PR01MB6626.eurprd01.prod.exchangelabs.com>

Hi all.

I'm just writing to draw your attention to this paper, which is Open Access:

Curtis, D. Welch?s t test is more sensitive to real world violations of distributional assumptions than student?s t test but logistic regression is more robust than either. Stat Papers (2024). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00362-024-01531-7
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00362-024-01531-7?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=oa_20240304&utm_content=10.1007/s00362-024-01531-7

I hadn't really noticed that the default implementation of the t test in R uses Welch's method rather than Student's. I know some people prefer Welch's method but the paper describes how it can be systematically biased and produce extremely low p values in real world scenarios.

If you agree with me, you might want to consider generally using Student's test instead, by using t.test(x, y, var.equal = TRUE).

Code to demonstrate the problem and play around with different scenarios, as described in the paper, is at: https://github.com/davenomiddlenamecurtis/TestTTest

Subject: [R] How to invert axis within defined range with ggplot2
 scale_y_reverse?
Message-ID: <CAMk+s2RKKTAcLYBLN2zDJ+rcEhEWO80TDwo7VrpT-tavd-KetQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I am drawing some data with ggplot2 and would like to reverse the
order of the y axis and set a custom range for it.
I can do the former but when I add the key `limits` to
`scale_y_reverse` I get an error as shows below and, worse, no data
shown in the plot.
How can I properly set a reverse y scale with a defined range in ggplot2?
Thank you

```
A <- rep(c(0, 3, 6, 12, 24), 3)
B <- c(rep(0,5), rep(1,5), rep(2,5))
V <- c(27.5,    27.01,    27.75,    27.98,    27.4,    25.69,
26.17,    27.78,    26.08,
       24.97,    23.18,    21.78,    22.49,    21.85,    22.2)
df <- data.frame(Conc = A, Time = B, Value = V)
df$Conc = as.factor(df$Conc)
df$Time = as.factor(df$Time)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(df, aes(x=Time, y=Value, colour=Conc, group=Conc)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_reverse(limits = c(20,30)) +
  geom_point(size=6) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = COLS)

Thank you. I though the values would have been reversed automatically.

Subject: [R] Function environments serialize to a lot of data until they
 don't
Message-ID: <20240308155759.35b22dbc@Tarkus>

Hello R-help,

I've noticed that my 'parallel' jobs take too much memory to store and
transfer to the cluster workers. I've managed to trace it to the
following:

# `payload` is being written to the cluster worker.
# The function FUN had been created as a closure inside my package:
payload$data$args$FUN
# function (l, ...) 
# withCallingHandlers(fun(l$x, ...), error = .wraperr(l$name))
# <bytecode: 0x5644a9f08a90>
# <environment: 0x5644aa841ad8>

# The function seems to bring a lot of captured data with it.
e <- environment(payload$data$args$FUN)
length(serialize(e, NULL))
# [1] 738202878      
parent.env(e)
# <environment: namespace:mypackage>

# The parent environment has a name, so it all must be right here.
# What is it?

ls(e, all.names = TRUE)
# [1] "fun"
length(serialize(e$fun, NULL))
# [1] 317

# The only object in the environment is small!
# Where is the 700 megabytes of data?

length(serialize(e, NULL))
# [1] 536
length(serialize(payload$data$args$FUN, NULL))
# [1] 1722

And once I've observed `fun`, the environment becomes very small and
now can be serialized in a very compact manner.

I managed to work around it by forcing the promise and explicitly
putting `fun` in a small environment when constructing the closure:

.wrapfun <- function(fun) {
 e <- new.env(parent = loadNamespace('mypackage'))
 e$fun <- fun
 # NOTE: a naive return(function(...)) could serialize to 700
 # megabytes due to `fun` seemingly being a promise (?). Once the
 # promise is resolved, suddenly `fun` is much more compact.
 ret <- function(l, ...) withCallingHandlers(
  fun(l$x, ...),
  error = .wraperr(l$name)
 )
 environment(ret) <- e
 ret
}

Is this analysis correct? Could a simple f <- force(fun) have sufficed?
Where can I read more about this type of problems?

If this really is due to promises, what would be the downsides of
forcing them during serialization?

Creating and setting environments is brittle and easy to get wrong. I
prefer to use a combination of proper lexical scoping, regular
assignments, and force() as I do below.

> Is this analysis correct? Could a simple f <- force(fun) have sufficed?
> Where can I read more about this type of problems?

Just force(fun), without the assignment, should be enough, or even
just fun, as in

    function(fun) { fun; <do something with fun> }

Using force() make the intent clearer.

Closures or formulas capturing large amount of data is something you
have to be careful about with serialization in general and distributed
memory computing in R in particular. There is a little on it in the
parallel vignette. I know I have talked and written about it in
various places but can't remember a specific reference right now.

I usually define a top level function to create any closures I want to
transmit and make sure they only capture what they need. A common
pattern is provided by a simple function for creating a normal
log-likelihood:

     mkLL <- function(x) {
 	m <- mean(x)
 	s <- sd(x)
 	function(y) sum(dnorm(y, m, s, log = TRUE))
     }

This avoids recomputing the mean and sd on every call. It is fine for
use within a single process, and the fact that the original data is
available in the environment might even be useful for debugging:

     ll <- mkLL(rnorm(10))
     environment(ll)$x
     ##  [1] -0.09202453  0.78901912 -0.66744232  1.36061149  1.50768816
     ##  [6] -2.60754997  0.68727212  0.31557476  2.02027688 -1.42361769

But it does prevent the data from being garbage-collected until
the returned result is no longer reachable. A more GC-friendly, and
serialization-friendly definition is

     mkLL <- function(x) {
 	m <- mean(x)
 	s <- sd(x)
 	x <- NULL  ## not needed anymore; remove from the result's enclosing env
 	function(y) sum(dnorm(y, m, s, log = TRUE))
     }

     ll <- mkLL(rnorm(1e7))
     length(serialize(ll, NULL))
     ## [1] 734

If you prefer to calculate the mean and sd yourself you could use

     mkLL1 <- function(m, s) function(x) sum(dnorm(x, m, s, log = TRUE))

Until the result is called for the first time the evaluation of the
arguments will be delayed, i.e. encoded in promises that record the
expression to evaluate and the environment in which to evaluate
it:

     f <- function(n) {
         x <- rnorm(n)
         mkLL1(mean(x), sd(x))
     }
     ll <- f(1e7)
     length(serialize(ll, NULL))
     ## [1] 80002223

Once the arguments are evaluated, the expressions are still needed for
substitute() and such, but the environment is not, so it is dropped,
and if the promise environment can no longer be reached it can be
garbage-collected, It will also no longer appear in a serialization:

     ll(1)
     ## [1] -1.419588
     length(serialize(ll, NULL))
     ## [1] 3537

Having a reference to a large environment is not much of an issue
within a single process, but can be in a distributed memory parallel
computing context.  To avoid this you can force evaluation of the
promises:

     mkLL1 <- function(m, s) {
 	force(m)
 	force(s)
 	function(x) sum(dnorm(x, m, s, log = TRUE))
     }
     ll <- f(1e7)
     length(serialize(ll, NULL))
     ## [1] 2146

The possibility of inadvertently transferring too much data is an
issue in distributed memory computing in general, so there are various
tools that help. A very simple tool available in the snow package for
snow clusters is snow.time(), which can produce some summary times and
a Gantt chart (patterned after ones produced by xpvm and xmpi). For
example, going back to the first definition of mkLL1 you can try

     mkLL1 <- function(m, s) function(x) sum(dnorm(x, m, s, log = TRUE))
     ll <- f(1e7)
     library(snow)
     cl <- makeCluster(2, type = "SOCK")
     tm <- snow.time(clusterCall(cl, ll, 1))
     print(tm)
     plot(tm)
     stopCluster(cl)

snow.time() is not very sophisticated, not very well tested, and may
be a bit brittle. It has not been not ported to the parallel package,
but it looks like most of the plumbing is there so porting it might
not be too hard.

Many. Think NSE, defaults that assume something happens in the body
before the are evaluated ...

Dear Luke,

Thank you for the detailed explanation of the power of force()! It does
solve my problem in a much more reliable manner than setting function
environments manually.

I think this also illustrates the danger of letting side effects come
near function arguments. A promise to read a file could survive on a
cluster node and result in a lot of head-scratching. A promise to write
to the connection number N, which coincides with a connection open on
the cluster node, could even do some damage. This is definitely
something to remember when creating closures.

I can see the snow.time() plot being useful. Thank you for letting me
know about it!

Hello,

This is the error that appears when I try to load library(Rcmdr). I am using R version 4.3.3. I have tried to upload the packages, uninstall them and intalling them again and nothing.
Loading required package: splines
Loading required package: RcmdrMisc
Loading required package: car
Loading required package: carData
Loading required package: sandwich
Loading required package: effects
lattice theme set by effectsTheme()
See ?effectsTheme for details.
Error: package or namespace load failed for ?Rcmdr?:
 .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'tcltk2', details:
  call: file.exists("~/.Rtk2theme")
  error: file name conversion problem -- name too long?

Once this appears I use path.expand('~') and this is R's answer:
[1] "C:\\Users\\marga\\OneDrive - Fundaci\xf3n Universitaria San Pablo CEU\\Documentos"

The thing is that in spanish we use accents, so this word (Fundaci\xf3n) really is Fundaci?n, but I can't change it.

I have tried to start R from CDM using: C:\Users\marga>set R_USER=C:\Users\marga\R_USER

C:\Users\marga>"C:\Users\marga\Desktop\R-4.3.3\bin\R.exe" CMD Rgui

At the beginning this worked but right now a message saying that this app cannot be used and that I have to ask the software company (photo attached)

What should I do?

Thanks,

Mar

Hello,

First of all, try running Rgui only, no R.exe CMD. Just Rgui.exe or
C:\Users\marga\Desktop\R-4.3.3\bin\Rgui.exe
Then, in Rgui, try loading Rcmdr

library(Rcmdr)


Also, do you have R in your Windows PATH variable? The directory to put 
in PATH should be

C:\Users\marga\Desktop\R-4.3.3\bin

so that Windows can find R.exe and Rgui.exe without the full path name.

Hope this helps,

We've seen this problem before:
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2023-December/478732.html

The workaround that should help is to set the R_USER environment
variable to C:\Users\marga before launching R.

Please let me know if you're willing to debug R. (This will likely
involve compiling R from source with debugging symbols enabled and
stepping through the code.) There are no places in the Windows code
where R gets the conversion obviously wrong. I don't have OneDrive and I
wasn't able to convince R to return an invalid R_USER path without it.
I'm halfway convinced this is due to a bug in OneDrive itself.

Dear Maria,

I'm sorry for somehow completely missing the second half of your

Glad to know the workaround helped. It sounds like your Windows
10 is set up in a user-hostile way.

It may help to visit the Windows Security settings and make an
exception for C:\Users\marga\Desktop\R-4.3.3\bin\R.exe. An approximate
instruction can be found at
<https://habr.com/en/companies/hetmansoftware/articles/549410/>, but it
might be the case that your university IT must take a look at it before
allowing you to run R on your computer.

Feel free to disregard this advice if someone with more Windows
experience shows up.

That's almost certainly going to be either the utf-8 character in the path
OR the use of one drive which isn't really a subfolder as I understand it.

When I've had these issues in the past, I've been able to mount a drive
(say U:/ ) which sites further down /up the folder tree so that R just
called "U:/RCodeFolder/Rfile.R"

Is that possible with an C drive?

Hi Maria,


I had something similar on my Windows work laptop at some point where the
home directory was something containing non ASCII characters. The easy
solution is to copy said directly from the file explorer into
utils::shortPathName, and then set that as the home directory. In my case,

> writeLines(utils::shortPathName(r"(C:\Users\iris\OneDrive - Organization
Name Non ASCII\Documents)"))
C:\Users\iris\ONEDRI~1\DOCUME~1

and then in the control panel, then user accounts (twice), then Change My
Environment Variables, enter the variable name HOME and the directory that
was produced by R. Now the HOME directory contains all ASCII characters so
everything works as expected.


I hope this helps!

The problem, as diagnosed by Maria in the first post of the thread, is
that the user home directory as known to R is stored in the ANSI
encoding instead of UTF-8, despite the session charset should be UTF-8
as Maria's Windows is sufficiently new [*]. As soon as any bit of R
tries to perform an encoding conversion using this path (for example,
file.exists() converting it from UTF-8 to UCS-2 in order to interact
with Windows filesystem APIs), the conversion fails. Since tcltk2 uses
file.exists('~/...') in its .onLoad, the package and any of its hard
dependencies are now broken.

Normally, this path is determined automatically to be something like
C:\Users\username\Documents. With OneDrive taking over, it turns out to
be something else and for some reason in the wrong encoding (ANSI but
marked as native == UTF-8).

The function that determines this path lives in src/gnuwin32/shext.c
(char *getRUser(void)). It starts by looking at the environment
variable R_USER, which is why in order to override OneDrive, the user
has to set it first (in the command line or system settings). If that
fails, R tries the environment variable HOME (which is usually set on
Windows, isn't it?), consults SHGetKnownFolderPath(FOLDERID_Documents)
(which returns the result as a wchar_t[] to be manually converted to
UTF-8 by R), consults a few more environment variables, and finally
tries to use the current directory. There is likely no easy way to use
`subst` to give a different home drive to R.

If I set %HOME% or even %R_USER% to a non-ASCII path without setting up
OneDrive, R works normally, so getenv() must be able to return
UTF-8-encoded variables. I don't see how ShellGetPersonalDirectory()
could fail in this manner. My remaining hypothesis is that OneDrive
somehow causes getenv("HOME") to return "C:\\Users\\marga\\OneDrive
- Fundaci?n Universitaria San Pablo CEU\\Documentos" in ANSI instead of
UTF-8.

If anyone here has OneDrive set up in this manner and can debug R,
a trace of what getRUser() actually does would be very useful.

Really appreciate if I can have someone suggestion how above can be

There's no interface for this in base R. It's always possible to write
some Windows API code to do that and call it from R using .Call()
(SendInput() is relatively easy to use [*]), but that takes effort and
knowledge of C.

What I suggest to do instead is to write an AutoHotKey script, making
use of the Click function [**] and taking arguments from the command
line [***], and then launch that script using system2(). AutoHotKey is
free software (GPLv2), designed specifically to automate other programs
and should be much easier to use correctly than C.

I previously heard of a R function namely refresh.console() which
would print the status within the loop as it progresses.

However I see this

Could you please help me find the correct function name?

?flush.console

... but you'll need to print/message/cat/... explicitly in the
loop, or the output won't be shown.  [Also, options(warn=1) might
be useful.]

Yes, for regular users, who just want to install R packages on Windows 
from source (packages that include C, C++ of Fortran code), all that is 
needed is to:

- install R from the official installer provided by CRAN

- install Rtools (also from CRAN) for that version of R (so Rtools42 for 
R 4.2, Rtools43 for R 4.3, Rtools44 for R-devel/to become R 4.4)

If both is done accepting the defaults, no additional configuration is 
needed. R will automatically find Rtools when it needs it. One can have 
multiple versions of R and multiple versions of Rtools installed on the 
system, R will find and use the version of Rtools it needs.

Subject: [R] CADFtest difference between max.lag.y with criterion and

Message-ID: <PAXPR10MB4637DB4D38FCBA02F31652DBAB292@PAXPR10MB4637.EURPRD10.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear Professor Bernhard,

Sorry for take your time, but I found something strange that I am not able to explain/understand.

Suppose that I compute the ADF test by using the criterion="BIC" to select the lags:

summary(CADFtest(y, max.lag.y = 20, type = "drift", criterion="BIC"))

Suppose that 2 lags are selected.

Next, if I set the lags to 2: summary(CADFtest(y, max.lag.y = 2, type = "drift"))
the ADF test result is different... You can confirm down, please. I think the reason is the number of included observations after adjustments... 8533 in the first case and 8551 in the second case.
What am I doing wrong?
Thank you very much for your help.
Best regards,
Jos? Dias Curto

Colleagues,

Using write.xlsx to extract data from an Excel file, I get this error message.


Error in .jcall("RJavaTools", "Ljava/lang/Object;", "invokeMethod", cl,  :
  java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded

I was thinking that this might be a RAM issue but with 16 GB RAM, I wasn't expecting this error message.

Any guidance would be appreciated.

There seems to be a default limit of 512 megabytes for the Java heap
size:

library(rJava)
getOption('java.parameters')
# [1] "-Xmx512m"

Does if help if you set options(java.parameters = '-Xmx2048m') (or
as much as you feel comfortable with) before loading XLConnect?

I think remember this error from trying to write an Excel file that already existed. If this file already exists, try to delete it and see, if this solves the issue.

Besides that you're writing that you are "Using write.xlsx to extract data from an Excel file", write.xlsx() is to write an Excel file, not to read from it. Should be read.xlsx() then iirc.

Subject: [R] [R-pkgs] clusterMI: Cluster Analysis with Missing Values by
 Multiple Imputation
Message-ID: <bb40a01d-a3dc-4b58-88d5-01f7eb4d4517@cnam.fr>

Dear all,

I am pleased to announce the release of a new package named 'clusterMI' on CRAN.

clusterMI allows clustering of incomplete observations by addressing missing values using multiple imputation.

For achieving this goal, the methodology consists in three steps:

1. missing data imputation using tailored imputation models: four multiple imputation methods are proposed, two are based on joint modelling (JM-GL and JM-DP) and two are fully sequential methods (FCS-homo and FCS-hetero).
2. cluster analysis of imputed data sets: six clustering methods are available (kmeans, pam, clara, hierarchical clustering, fuzzy c-means and gaussian mixture), but custom methods can also be easily used.
3. partition pooling: the set of partitions is aggregated using NMF based method. An associated instability measure is computed by bootstrap. Among applications, this instability measure can be used to choose a number of clusters with missing values.

The package also offers several diagnostic tools for tuning the number of imputed data sets, for checking convergence in sequential imputation, for checking the fit of imputation models, etc.

This is the first version of the package, your feedback and suggestions are welcome!

Please find more details and download the package from the following link:https://cran.r-project.org/package=clusterMI

Best regards,

V. Audigier

Dear all;
I found a useful video on youtube that has explained how to install Rtools.
I followed the instructions and the problem was solved.
" Installing R version 4.0 + RTools 4.0 + RStudio For Data Science (#R
#RTools #RStudio #DataScience) - YouTube
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2IPWVXaUuU> "
Sincerely

2 things:

1) utils::install.packages(....) sometimes helps if the Rstudio version got wedged somehow.

2) You seem to be missing several Recommended packages (lattice, MASS, Matrix, nlme, cluster,....). Did you install R without those?

I have a source file with oxygen-style comments (and description & licence files), and I?m trying to build a package. oxygen & devtools seem to work, and the tarball exists, but install.packages balks. Does anyone know what?s happening?

Using RStudio? It happens to override install.packages with a function
that doesn't quite handle file paths. Try utils::install.packages(tar,
type = "source", repos = NULL).

   Ivan, can you give more detail on this? I've heard this issue 
mentioned, but when I open RStudio and run find("install.packages") it 
returns "utils::install.packages", and running dump() from within 
RStudio console and from an external "R --vanilla" gives identical results.

   I thought at one point this might only refer to the GUI 
package-installation interface, but you seem to be saying it's the 
install.packages() function as well.

   Running an up-to-date RStudio on Linux, FWIW -- maybe weirdness only 
happens on other OSs?

Thank you, but I think I was already using utils.

On MacOS, I see this:

 > install.packages
function (...)
.rs.callAs(name, hook, original, ...)
<environment: 0x7fa7c72a6268>

I get the same results as you from find().  I'm not sure what RStudio is 
doing to give a different value for the function than what find() sees.

Is the source for your package online somewhere?

Has this been fixed in a recent RStudio version? This is what I get on
a Windows virtual machine:

.rs.callAs(name, hook, original, ...)
<environment: 0x000000000c49b740>

Turns out that RStudio replaces the install.packages object in the utils 
package.

   Hmm, looks platform-specific.  Under Linux both RStudio and external 
R console return

a0b52513622c41c11e3ef57c7a485767

for digest::digest(install.packages)

Subject: [R] geom_edge & color
Message-ID: <022201da7af4$704240d0$50c6c270$@gmx.ch>

Dear community

I am using ggraph to plot a network analysis. See part 2 in the working
example.
Besides different colors for different groups of nodes:
--> geom_node_point(aes(size = V(network)$hub_score*200, color=
as.factor(V(network)$community)))
I additionally want to consider different colors for different edge groups
The grouping is defined in the edge_list$relationship: negative relationship
= red and positive relationship = darkblue. The code is working in the way
that the  groups are separated by two colors. However, the code uses not the
assigned colors. Does anyone have any idea how to adapt the code?
--> geom_edge_arc(curvature=0.3, aes(width=(E(network)$weight/10),
color=c("darkblue", "red")[as.factor(edge_list$relationship)], alpha=0.5)) +

Kind regards
Sibylle

I was thinking of making it Open Source, but I haven?t yet. It?s mostly a collection of small utility functions (more oxygen comments than actual code). I built the package on my Windows machine a few months ago, but my Mac first wouldn?t install roygen2 & devtools and now (with the latest version of R) won?t install the tarball that they create. (A work-around that I might try again is to build the package under Windows and ship the tarball to my Mac.)

Regards,
Jorgen.

Example:

#' Adjust number of columns used in printing

#'

#' Use \code{\link{options}} to determine the current number of columns, increment

#' or decrement, and pass the result as \code{width} in a second call to \code{options}.

#'

#' @param dw signed amount by which to increment the number of columns

#'

#' @return a list with the old value of \code{options('width')}

#'

#' @export



width <- function(dw) options(width = options('width')[[1L]] + as.integer(dw))

Sorry, then it has been my mistake to blame RStudio for this.

We can try debugging this. If you start a fresh R process and run
tools:::.install_packages(path_to_tarball), the installation will (try
to) proceed in the current process instead of a child process. Once it
fails, traceback() will be available to show you where the error
condition has been raised. What does it say?

Alternatively,

1. Check the package R files for stray library() calls. Generally,
packages should not be calling library().

2. Try a "binary search" approach. Make a copy of your package code but
remove half of the files (or half of the functions if they live in a
single file). Keep removing a half (or go to the other half) depending
on whether the same error keeps happening.

Good luck!

Thank you. tools:::.install_packages works.

It happens that one of the functions in my package is a utility to build packages. I guess I should change the install step.

Regards,
Jorgen.

I'm glad it works, but it shouldn't be necessary to use (and is not
part of the API: not documented to keep working this way).

Since you're already using devtools, perhaps devtools::install will
succeed. But it's not obvious why utils::install.packages() is failing,
and it should still be called by devtools::install().

> It happens that one of the functions in my package is a utility to

Try setting a breakpoint in system2 before launching your function:

debugonce(system2)
build.package('/path/to/the/source/tree')

This should land you in R's "browser" (see help(browser) for how to use
it). At this point, what is `command` and what are the `args`? If you
remove c("CMD", "INSTALL") from the `args` vector and give the rest as
the argument to .install_packages() in a fresh process, will it break
in a similar manner?

Browse[2]> command
[1] "/usr/lib/R/bin/R"
Browse[2]> args
[1] "CMD" "INSTALL" "-l"
"'/home/ivan/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.2'"
"'/home/ivan/path/to/package_1.0.tar.gz'"

# (start a new process)

tools:::.install_packages(c(
 '-l',
 # you'll have to manually unquote the file paths:
 # the strings above are for both R and the command line shell
 # to interpret, but here we're only giving them to R, not the shell
 "/home/ivan/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.2",
 "/home/ivan/path/to/package_1.0.tar.gz"
))

Yes, and this has been the case for several years now, and I
have mentioned this several times, too  (though some of it
possibly not in a public R-* mailing list).

And yes, that they modify the package environment
  as.environment("package:utils")
but leave the
  namespace  asNamespace("utils")
unchanged, makes it harder to see what's
going on (but also has less severe consequences; if they kept to
the otherwise universal *rule* that the namespace and package must have the same objects
apart from those only in the namespace,
people would not even have access to R's true install.packages()
but only see the RStudio fake^Hsubstitute..

We are still not happy with their decision. Also
help(install.packages) goes to R's documentation of R's
install.packages, so there's even more misleading of useRs.

Well, platform-specific maybe, notably probably the *RStudio*-version
matters (for once).

One one of our public compute-machines running Linux Fedora 38
  (I don't have RStudio installed on my desktop as I loathe it
   badly to see RStudio start up when I click at an *R script in
   the OS gui file browser ... !:!P:!)(*&))
 
I definitely see

No need for any hashes to see that install.packages is not the
one from R.

Concluding from your, Ben's, finding I'd guess that Posit
finally decided to move away from this very unfriendly idea of
sneakily replacing a base R function ?

That would actually give raise to some applause..

The good news for Jorgen (who may not be reading this thread any more) 
is that one can still be sure of getting the original install.packages() 
by using

     utils:::install.packages( ... )

with *three* colons, to get the internal (namespace) version of the 
function.

Um, what's with the triple colon? At least on my install, double seems to suffice:

[1] TRUE

.rs.callAs(name, hook, original, ...)

Dear Sibylle,

your example is not working! E.g. no data for "aes_collapsed".

Yes, you're right.  The version found in the search list entry for 
"package:utils" is the RStudio one; the ones found with two or three 
colons are the original.

Subject: Re: [External] Re: [R] Building Packages.

At least on my installed version (which tells me it is out of date)
they appear to just be modifying the "package:utils" parent frame of
the global search path.

There seem to be a few others:

checkUtilsFun <- function(n)
     identical(get(n, "package:utils"), get(n, getNamespace("utils")))
names(which(! sapply(ls("package:utils", all = TRUE), checkUtilsFun)))
## [1] "bug.report"       "file.edit"        "help.request" ## [4] "history" 
"install.packages" "remove.packages" ## [7] "View"

I don't know why they don't put these overrides in the tools:rstudio frame.
At least that would make them more visible.

You can fix all of these with something like

local({
       up <- match("package:utils", search())
       detach("package:utils")
       library(utils, pos = up)
})

or just install.packages with

local({
     up <- match("package:utils", search())
     unlockBinding("install.packages", pos.to.env(up))
     assign("install.packages", utils::install.packages, "package:utils")
     lockBinding("install.packages", pos.to.env(up))
})

Best,

luke

If you are wondering why RStudio did this, you can see their substitute 
function using

   (parent.env(environment(install.packages)))$hook

They appear to do these things:

  - Allow package installation to be disabled.

  - Check if a package to be installed is already loaded, so that 
RStudio can restart R for the install.

  - Add Rtools to the PATH if necessary.

  - Trigger an event to say that something is about to be changed about 
the installed packages, presumably so that they can mark a cached list 
of installed packages as stale.

  - Call the original function.

I think all of these things could be done  if install.packages() called 
a hook at the start, as library() does (via attachNamespace()) when a 
package is attached.  It might be that putting the wrapper code into 
tools:rstudio would cause confusion for users when there were two 
objects of the same name on the search list, though I don't see how.

   Is your Fedora machine using the bspm package with bspm::enable() in 
the .Rprofile (to install binary packages from the r2u repository)? 
bspm adds a hook by using trace() on install.packages, which makes it 
look like this.

   My guess is that if you start with --vanilla *or* run bspm::disable() 
that you'll get back to the original-as-installed version.

   Even if you have RStudio installed you could change the association 
in your GUI file browser to open R files in emacs by default ...

   cheers

With all this discussion, I shudder to ask this. I may have missed the
answers but the discussion seems to have been about identifying and solving
the problem rapidly rather than what maybe is best going forward if all
parties agree.

What was the motivation for what RSTUDIO did for their version and the
decision to replace what came with utils unless someone very explicitly
over-rode them by asking for the original? Is their version better in other
ways? Is there a possibility the two implementations may someday merge into
something that meets several sets of needs or are they incompatible?

Is there agreement that what broke with the substitution is a valid use or
is it something that just happens to work on the utils version if not
patched?

Yes, you're right.  The version found in the search list entry for 
"package:utils" is the RStudio one; the ones found with two or three 
colons are the original.

   I think this might be a good conversation for someone to have with 
the Posit folks

   * is there a more transparent way to do what they want?
     * either, long-term, by having utils::install_packages() add a 
'hook' feature as mentioned by someone
     * using a similar method to bspm::enable(), which calls trace() to 
add an external hook

   * is there a good place for them to put the documentation of what 
they're doing?

   * can they fix things that are broken (e.g.? handling of paths), and 
allow optional arguments to override behaviours that are different from 
utils::install.packages (e.g. add a possibility to say force=TRUE to 
override the "don't reinstall if already installed")

   ?

   cheers

Thank you Duncan, you explained quite a bit.

I am unclear how this change causes the problem the OP mentioned.

It is an example of people using a clever trick to get what they think they
want that could be avoided if the original program provided a hook. Of
course the hook could be used more maliciously by others.

If you are wondering why RStudio did this, you can see their substitute 
function using

   (parent.env(environment(install.packages)))$hook

They appear to do these things:

  - Allow package installation to be disabled.

  - Check if a package to be installed is already loaded, so that 
RStudio can restart R for the install.

  - Add Rtools to the PATH if necessary.

  - Trigger an event to say that something is about to be changed about 
the installed packages, presumably so that they can mark a cached list 
of installed packages as stale.

  - Call the original function.

I think all of these things could be done  if install.packages() called 
a hook at the start, as library() does (via attachNamespace()) when a 
package is attached.  It might be that putting the wrapper code into 
tools:rstudio would cause confusion for users when there were two 
objects of the same name on the search list, though I don't see how.

So RStudio unlocks the bindings and alters the exported environment? That seems like another reason to stick to the terminal interface.

Thank you for letting me know. I hope I can avoid using private functions in future. As noted below, my function seems to work now.

> Try setting a breakpoint in system2 before launching your function:

> Best regards,

Now build.package works as written, so there?s nothing to debug. The problem may have been that this package is so important to me that I put it in .Rprofile. The package was not installed for the new version of R, so every R session started with an annoying error message. Presumably a separate session started with R CMD would just fail without installing the package. That?s no longer a problem because the package is now installed. However, I don?t know why the error message wasn?t clearer, and I?m puzzled that I was able to install roxygen2 & devtools. Thank you everyone, and I?m sorry if I didn?t give the right information to diagnose the problem faster.

Regards,
Jorgen.

This must be the solution to the mystery. I have recently added some
code that raised an error (lattice::standard.theme(...), but without a
new enough 'lattice' to understand the arguments) to my .Rprofile, and
it broke quite a few things related to package development until I fixed
my .Rprofile.

Congratulations on solving the problem!

Dear Sibylle,

 

your example is not working! E.g. no data for "aes_collapsed".

 

Best,

 

Kimmo

Hi,

this seems to work (assuming that your problem was the setting of
colours...):

--- snip ---

network %>%
    ggraph(., layout = "auto") +
    # This produces an error...
    # geom_edge_arc(curvature=0.3, aes(width=(E(network)$weight/10),
color=c("darkblue", "red")[as.factor(edge_list$relationship)], alpha=0.5))
+ 
    # ... this works :-)
    geom_edge_arc(curvature=0.3, aes(width=E(network)$weight/10,
color=edge_list$relationship), alpha=.5) +
    scale_edge_color_manual(values=c("pos"="darkblue", "neg"="red")) +
    
    # This does not work either...
    # geom_node_point(aes(size = V(network)$hub_score*200, color=
as.factor(V(network)$community))) +
    # ... so try this :)
    geom_node_point(aes(size = V(network)$hub_score*200,
color=V(network)$Subcategory_type)) +
    geom_node_text(aes(label =  V(network)$name), size=3, color="white",
repel=T)+
    scale_color_scico_d(palette = "batlow")+
    scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2,4))+
    scale_size(range = c(0.5,15)) +
    theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "black"),
          legend.position = "right",
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black"))

--- snip ---

At least in my data created with your code, the object "network" does not
have an attribute "community". I use the existing "Subcategory_type"
instead, because I had no time to debug this problem :-)

I do not know whether this produces what you expect or want to visualise.

HTH,

Kimmo

Subject: [R] Double buffering plots on Windows
Message-ID: <61932829-7887-4658-BD7A-164D069B9B54@usask.ca>

Hello:

I want to present a sequence of plots as an animation.   As a toy example consider the code

function(n){for (i in 1:n){
plot(1:100,sin(i*(1:100)),type="l")
title(paste("n=",i))
segments(0,0,100,0,col=2)
}}

This sort-of works on a MacOS platform, but the rendering of the plots is a bit choppy.  Inserting a sleep function allows the plots to evolve smoothly.

function(n){for (i in 1:n){
plot(1:100,sin(i*(1:100)),type="l")
title(paste("n=",i))
segments(0,0,100,0,col=2)
Sys.sleep(.2)
}}

However, on a Windows platform, only the last plot is rendered without the Sys.sleep, so the dynamic element is lost.   Inserting the Sys.sleep does allow all the plots to be rendered, but they seem to be erased before they are drawn again, so there is substantial flicker in the appearance.

Is there some kind of double-buffering available within R, so that plots are rendered only after they are fully drawn, leaving the previous plot visible until it is replaced?   I just used the default graphics driver on Windows ? is there perhaps a different driver that will the graphics smoother?

Hi all,

I am creating an X1.RData file using the R 4.2.2 library.
   x1.R
    save(datafilename, file="X1.RData")

When I am trying to load  this file using another script

X2.R
load("X1.RData")

I am getting this error message:
 Error in load("X1.RData", :
 bad restore file magic number (file may be corrupted)  .. no data  loaded.

I am using the same R library (R 4.2.2)

What would be the cause for this error message and how to fix it?

Thank you,

This error happens very early when R tries to load the file, right
at the first few bytes. Is "X1.RData" large? Can you share it, or at
least a hexadecimal dump of the first few hundred bytes?

Yes, X1.RData is large(more than 40M rows) .
How do I get the first   few bytes?

What does file.info('X1.RData') say?

Do you get any output if you run print(readBin('X1.RData', raw(), 128))?

If this is happening on a Linux or macOS machine, the operating system
command xxd -l 128 X1.RData will give the same output in a more
readable manner, but the readBin(...) output from R should be fine too.

Thank you!

This doesn't look like any structured data to me. In particular, it
doesn't look like something written by R: those created by modern
versions of R with default settings typically start with an "RDX2\n"
(52 44 58 32 0a) or at least "X\n" (58 0a). Could be a middle of
compressed stream, as if the file was truncated while it was being
written.

Do you get similar results with saveRDS(datafilename, 'X1.rds') and
data2 <- readRDS('X1.rds')? Does this happen with other R objects that
you try to save or in your other scripts?

Subject: [R] Problem with new version of R: Mutated vocals
Message-ID: <GVAP278MB030901B49E045D0062AC79D69B312@GVAP278MB0309.CHEP278.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear ladies and gentlemen,

I have recently installed the latest version of R (4.3.3) for windows. Now I have the following problems with mutated vowels like ?, ?, etc. Here is an example:
If I type the command:
Dir <- "C/Users/macho/Documents/_LVn/Experimentelle ?bungen"
in the R console there is no problem. However, if I put the same command into a source file (e.g. Test.r) and call this file from R (via the source command), I get the following error message:

> source("C:\\Users\\macho\\Documents\\_LVn\\Experimentelle ?bungen\\R-Scripts\\R-Dokumentation\\R_scripts zur R_Dokumentation\\Kapitel 4 Erstellen eines Balkendiagramms\\Test.R")
Fehler: invalid multibyte character in parser (C:\Users\macho\Documents\_LVn\Experimentelle ?bungen\R-Scripts\R-Dokumentation\R_scripts zur R_Dokumentation\Kapitel 4 Erstellen eines Balkendiagramms\Test.R:1:54

In addition, text files saved with an older version of R (using the function write.table) containing mutated vowels are not read-in correctly by the function read.table.
I would be glad, if someone could help me with this problem.

Kind regards,
Siegfried Macho.

A few versions ago, the R developers made the change of the encoding
used by R on Windows. Instead of the ANSI encoding, R now uses UTF-8:
https://blog.r-project.org/2020/05/02/utf-8-support-on-windows/index.html

This makes it possible to represent many more characters than the
256-byte range covered by CP1252, but the byte sequences are now
different. Also, non-ASCII characters will take more than one byte to
store.

Can you save the script using the UTF-8 encoding instead of CP1252?
Alternatively, try source(..., encoding = 'CP1252').

In a similar manner, try read.table(..., fileEncoding = 'CP1252').
Setting encoding = 'latin1' may also work, even if it's technically a
different encoding.

Dear Kommo

Many thanks for the valuable solution.

Subject: Re: [R] geom_edge & color

Hi,

this seems to work (assuming that your problem was the setting of
colours...):

--- snip ---

network %>%
    ggraph(., layout = "auto") +
    # This produces an error...
    # geom_edge_arc(curvature=0.3, aes(width=(E(network)$weight/10), color=c("darkblue", "red")[as.factor(edge_list$relationship)], alpha=0.5))
+ 
    # ... this works :-)
    geom_edge_arc(curvature=0.3, aes(width=E(network)$weight/10, color=edge_list$relationship), alpha=.5) +
    scale_edge_color_manual(values=c("pos"="darkblue", "neg"="red")) +
    
    # This does not work either...
    # geom_node_point(aes(size = V(network)$hub_score*200, color=
as.factor(V(network)$community))) +
    # ... so try this :)
    geom_node_point(aes(size = V(network)$hub_score*200,
color=V(network)$Subcategory_type)) +
    geom_node_text(aes(label =  V(network)$name), size=3, color="white", repel=T)+
    scale_color_scico_d(palette = "batlow")+
    scale_edge_width(range = c(0.2,4))+
    scale_size(range = c(0.5,15)) +
    theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "black"),
          legend.position = "right",
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black"))

--- snip ---

At least in my data created with your code, the object "network" does not have an attribute "community". I use the existing "Subcategory_type"
instead, because I had no time to debug this problem :-)

I do not know whether this produces what you expect or want to visualise.

HTH,

Kimmo

Subject: [R] an issue about subsetting a vector
Message-ID: <73cc0a70-a8c1-41f7-afb5-967a092ff0ec@infolink.com.br>


To the R-Help list,

I would like to have a clarification about an issue that I observe when 
subsetting a vector. This is R version 4.3.3 on Windows 10.

-- Example with a vector:

 > a <- 1:5
 > a
[1] 1 2 3 4 5

So we have, with a negative index:
 > a[-3]
[1] 1 2 4 5

But when the index is integer(0), we have this:

 > a[integer(0)]
integer(0)
 > a[-integer(0)]
integer(0)

When it comes to the function integer(), the R Help file says:

"Value: integer creates a integer vector of the specified length. Each 
element of the vector is equal to 0."

But we see below that integer(0) is some kind of null vector, that is, 
no numbers are represented by integer(0):

 > class(integer(0))
[1] "integer"
 > length(integer(0))
[1] 0

So my question: in the expression a[-integer(0)], what happens exactly 
with the index -integer(0)? We see that integer(0), although of class 
integer, does not represent any numbers, as its length is zero, so it 
seems to me that it makes no sense to calculate its negative 
-integer(0). What exactly is -integer(0)?

In particular, why a[-integer(0)] is not the whole vector a, that is, 
[1] 1 2 3 4 5? In the example below, if the invalid index -99 is 
presented to a, the result is the whole vector:

 > a[-99]
[1] 1 2 3 4 5

If -integer(0) is an invalid index, why do we have this?

 > a[-integer(0)]
integer(0)

Why a[-integer(0)] is not the whole vector a?

Thank you very much.

    As with a lot of things in R, the behaviour is counterintuitive but 
(arguably) logical. The key (maybe) is that `a[-x]` does not mean "take 
all of the elements of a except those indicated by `x`, but rather, 
"negate x, then take all but the negative elements".  In other words,

  -integer(0)  is   integer(0)  (we multiply *each of the elements of 
integer(0)* by -1, but integer(0) has no elements)

   that reduces to a[integer(0)]

and from there you get "select none of the elements".

   A related point is explained in the R Inferno 
https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf section 8.1.13, 
"negative nothing is something".

Hi

Take a look at dev.hold() and dev.flush()
