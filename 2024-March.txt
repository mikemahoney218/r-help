I decided to do a direct comparison of transpose and sweep.


library(microbenchmark)

NN <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)  # Example matrix
lambda <- c(2, 3, 4)  # Example vector
colNN <- t(NN)

microbenchmark(
  sweep     = sweep(NN, 2, lambda, "/"),
  transpose = t(t(NN)/lambda),
  colNN     = colNN/lambda
)


Unit: nanoseconds
      expr   min    lq     mean median      uq   max neval cld
     sweep 13817 14145 15115.06  14350 14657.5 75932   100 a  
 transpose  1845  1927  2151.68   2132  2214.0  7093   100  b 
     colNN    82   123   141.86    123   164.0   492   100   c

Note that transpose is much faster than sweep because it is doing less work,
I believe essentially just changing the order of indexing.

Using the natural sequencing for column-ordered matrices is much much faster.

Dear Ivan,

Thank you very much for this interesting information.

Regarding:
"For well-behaved packages that declare their dependencies correctly,
parsing the NAMESPACE for importFrom() and import() calls should give
you the explicit imports."

I did learn something new (I am not very experienced in package writing). Unfortunately, Roxygen2 as of the current version still suggests to use the pkg::fname approach:
"If you are using just a few functions from another package, we recommending adding the package to the Imports: field of the DESCRIPTION file and calling the functions explicitly using ::, e.g., pkg::fun()."
https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/namespace.html

Regarding analysing the actual code: it is good to know that CMD check has also some functionality. I will look into it, when I find some free time.

tools:::.check_packages_used is a few pages of code. On the other hand, the help page for codetools::checkUsage is quite cryptic. But it's good to know at least where to look.

Sincerely,

Leonard

For well-behaved packages that declare their dependencies correctly,
parsing the NAMESPACE for importFrom() and import() calls should give
you the explicit imports. (What if the package imports the whole
dependency? The safe assumption is that all functions are used, but it
comes with false positives. You could also walk the package code
looking for function names that may belong to the imported package, but
that may involve both false positives and false negatives.)

For the rest of the imports and uses of weak dependencies, you'll have
to walk the package code looking for the uses of the `::` operator. See
how R CMD check walks the package code in functions
tools:::.check_packages_used and codetools::checkUsage.

A less-well-behaved package can always load a namespace during runtime
and choose the functions to call depending on the phase of the moon or
weather on Jupiter. For these, like for the halting problem, there's no
general solution: the package could be written to say, "if Leonard's
function says I'm about to call foo::bar, I won't do it, otherwise I
will".

I added two more rows

library(microbenchmark)

NN <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)  # Example matrix
lambda <- c(2, 3, 4)  # Example vector
colNN <- t(NN)
matlam <- matrix(lambda, byrow=TRUE, nrow=2, ncol=3)

microbenchmark(
  sweep     = sweep(NN, 2, lambda, "/"),
  transpose = t(t(NN)/lambda),
  colNN     = colNN/lambda,
  fullsize  = NN / matrix(lambda, byrow=TRUE, nrow=2, ncol=3),
  rowlam  = NN / matlam
)

Unit: nanoseconds
      expr   min    lq     mean  median      uq   max neval cld
     sweep 12546 12792 13919.91 12997.0 13325.0 85608   100 a
 transpose  1640  1763  1986.04  1947.5  2050.0  7462   100  b
     colNN    82    82   161.13   123.0   123.0  3854   100   c
  fullsize   738   820   932.34   881.5   963.5  2829   100  bc
    rowlam    82   123   168.92   164.0   164.0   820   100   c

reshaping the denominator to the correct size in advance is very helpful if you will be doing this division more than once.

Very interesting - thanks! Most of my problems are not limited by 
compute speed, but its clear that for some sorts of compute-intensive 
problems, sweep might be a limiting approach.

There are *vectors* and they belong to a vector space and that's it.
(and yes, arrays of a given rank and dimensions also are
 elements of a vector space, and hence matrices are, and then
 indeed, a 3x1 matrix and a 1x3 matrix are *not* members of the
 same vector space -- even though the two vector spaces are
 isomorphic to each other)

The matlab induced --> applied linear algebra / math
"column- and row-vectors"  have been convenient because then
everything is a matrix (or scalar), and that fits well with a
product called "matlab" which is short for "matrix lab(oratory)".
BUT they are  mathematically confusing and therefore in my view
very undesirable terminology.

I'm very very strongly with Jeff that "the only" consistent
language would be to call them 1-row matrix and 1-column matrix,
because that's what they are, well defined and perfect within 
the well defined math realm of linear algebra.

Yes, matrix-vector calculus , scalar products, bilinear forms, ...
can be generalized in such ways that 1-row matrices and 1-column
matrices can be treated equivalently to vectors and vice versa
.. and that is sometimes convenient. 

Still, the "column-vector"  and "row-vector"  terms have
lead to much confusion in my view,
because really  Nx1  or  1xM  are dimensions of matrices and
*not* of any vectors  ..

I agree. And that's good -- because "vectors are vectors" aka
"a rank-1 array is a rank-1 array is a rank-1 array" (Richard O'Keefe)

Message-ID: <ce1383d4-8339-47a3-b56c-11c4759e905a@sjd.es>

Hi all,

I tested next command:

gsub("([aeiouAEIOU])([aeiouAEIOU])", "\\1_\\2", "aerioue")

with the following output:

[1] "a_eri_ou_e"

So, there are two consecutive vowels where an underscore is not added.

May it be a bug? Is it expected (bug or not)? Is there any chance to get 
what I want (an underscore between each pair of consecutive vowels)?


Thank you!

Best regards,

Iago

Hi Iago,


This is not a bug. It is expected. Patterns may not overlap. However, there
is a way to get the result you want using perl:

```R
gsub("([aeiouAEIOU])(?=[aeiouAEIOU])", "\\1_", "aerioue", perl = TRUE)
```

The specific change I made is called a positive lookahead, you can read
more about it here:

https://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html

It's a way to check for a piece of text without consuming it in the match.

Also, since you don't care about character case, it might be more legible
to add ignore.case = TRUE and remove the upper case characters:

```R
gsub("([aeiou])(?=[aeiou])", "\\1_", "aerioue", perl = TRUE, ignore.case =
TRUE)

## or

gsub("(?i)([aeiou])(?=[aeiou])", "\\1_", "aerioue", perl = TRUE)
```

I hope this helps!

Curious to know if this warning is expected behavior, and if so, what is 
the recommended way instead:

     > dput(letters, file = stderr())
    c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l",
    "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y",
    "z")
    Warning message:
    In dput(letters, file = stderr()) : wrote too few characters

(I ask because it doesn't happen when using file = stdout())

Here's another *incorrect* way to do it -- incorrect because it will
not always work, unlike Iris's correct solution. But it does not
require PERL type matching. The idea: separate the two vowels in the
regex by a character that you know cannot appear (if there is such)
and match it optionally, e.g. with '*" repetition specifier. I used
"?" for the optional character below (which must be escaped).

Sounds like a bug.

This is where the warning is produced:

    int res = Rconn_printf(con, "%s\n", CHAR(STRING_ELT(tval, i)));
    if(!havewarned &&
       res < strlen(CHAR(STRING_ELT(tval, i))) + 1) {
	warning(_("wrote too few characters"));
	havewarned = TRUE;
    }

At this point, `res` is 0, and CHAR(STRING_ELT(tval, i)) is what you'd
expect:

(gdb) x /s (void*)(STRING_ELT(tval, i))+48
0x5555561bf0a8: "c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\",
\"h\", \"i\", \"j\", \"k\", \"l\", "

`res` is 0 because that's what (con->vfprintf)(...) returns:

2813    static int stderr_vfprintf(Rconnection con, const char *format, va_list ap)
2814    {
2815        REvprintf(format, ap);
2816        return 0;
2817    }

Why doesn't it warn for stdout()? Doesn't stdout_vfprintf(...) behave
the same? That's because stdout() (connection #1) is special for dput(),
and instead of going through the connection system, it goes straight for
Rprintf():

426         else { // ifile == 1 : "Stdout"
427             for (int i = 0; i < LENGTH(tval); i++)
428                 Rprintf("%s\n", CHAR(STRING_ELT(tval, i)));
429         }

Not sure what the right fix is. There may be code depending on
(con->vfprintf)(...) returning 0.

Ivan

This really is all LaTeX errors, not R errors. Both examples complain that pdftexcmds.sty is not installed. Most "sty" files are in LaTeX packages. Each LaTeX distribution has its own way to install packages ... but the difficulty is usually on the same order of difficulty as installing R packages from CRAN... that is, pretty easy. But you need to read about _your_ TeX system for details. I use Google to figure out which package has the given file in it... it is usually the same as whatever comes before ".sty", but not always.

Quick things first: have you installed all the build-dependencies? apt
build-dep r-base (maybe with --install-suggests? haven't tried that in
a while) should do that. In particular, the build dependencies include
texlive-fonts-extra and texlive-latex-extra. That's a lot of packages,
but some of them are required to compile LaTeX documents produced by R.

Can you compile a minimal LaTeX document? Something like:

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\[ \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X} \beta \]
\end{document}

Does tools::texi2pdf('THISFILE.tex') fail with a similar error message?

The matrix equivalent of
  x <- ...
  v <- ...
  x[length(x)+1] <- v
is
  m <- ...
  r <- ...
  m <- rbind(m, r)
or
  m <- ...
  k <- ...
  m <- cbind(m, c)

A vector or matrix so constructed never has "holes" in it.
It's better to think of CONSTRUCTING vectors and matrices rather than
INITIALISING them,
because always being fully defined is important.

It would be really really helpful to have a clearer idea of what you
are trying to do.

On my system, pdftexcmds.sty can be found in
/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/generic/pdftexcmds/pdftexcmds.sty
A quick poking around with 'apt' and 'dpkg-query -L' told me that this
comes from the
texlive-latex-recommended
Ubuntu package.  So on my system, if I didn't already have this,
sudo apt install texlive-latex-recommended
should fix the problem.

Thank you Ivan and Richard...

Short version: a simple "sudo apt install texlive" fixed it.

Longer version (attempt at a post-mortem): previously (back on 
2023-11-05) on this same system I built R version 4.3.2; and 
/home/btyner/R432/lib/R/doc/NEWS.pdf does exist (and is a valid pdf with 
48 pages) from that same install. Likewise before that on 2023-07-02 I 
built R version 4.3.1 and the NEWS.pdf is fine (47 pages) there too.

Still not sure how it happened that my system lost track of the 
necessary texlive add-ons at some point between 2023-11-05 and now, but 
running "sudo apt install texlive" made it clear that 
texlive-latex-recommended was indeed one of the culprits as suggested by 
Richard.

    The following additional packages will be installed:
     ? fonts-texgyre tex-gyre texlive-fonts-recommended
    texlive-latex-recommended tipa
    Suggested packages:
     ? texlive-fonts-recommended-doc texlive-latex-recommended-doc
    texlive-luatex texlive-pstricks tipa-doc
    The following NEW packages will be installed:
     ? fonts-texgyre tex-gyre texlive texlive-fonts-recommended
    texlive-latex-recommended tipa

In an attempt to figure out what might have happened after 2023-11-05,

    zgrep texlive /var/log/dpkg.log.*.gz

revealed some texlive related activity back on 2023-11-23 but no

One more thing:

    HISTTIMEFORMAT="%Y-%m-%d %T " history | grep texlive

revealed that I ran "sudo apt install texlive-latex-base" back on 
2024-02-19, so maybe that had something to do with it. Sadly the shell 
history does not exist prior to that date.

"It would be really really helpful to have a clearer idea of what you
are trying to do."

Amen!

But in R, "constructing" objects by extending them piece by piece is
generally very inefficient (e.g.
https://r-craft.org/growing-objects-and-loop-memory-pre-allocation/),
although sometimes?/often? unavoidable (hence the relevance of your
comment above). R generally prefers to take a "whole object" point of
view ( see R books by Chambers, et. al.) and provides code for basic
operations like vector/matrix, etc. construction to do so. When this
is not possible, I suspect "optimal" efficient strategies for
allocating space to build objects gets you into the weeds of how R
works.

Cheers,
Bert

To be fair, these replies no longer include the original question, which was IMO really quite clear (if misguided), and was actually targeted at understanding pre-allocation for better performance. Richard's suggestion to store the along-the-way constructed vectors in a list and examine the lengths of the elements of that list after it is completely constructed if it is really desired to force vectors of varying lengths into a matrix seems appropriate. The possibly-misguided part is in the thought that vectors of different lengths belong in a matrix at all... leaving them in a list seems more likely to be appropriate.

OP: Avoid mis-using NA to "fill out" the end of uniform-length vectors. Each index position in a vector should represent some information... if you are throwing NAs or zeros in willy-nilly then you are not taking care to assign meaning to those positions, and likely wasting memory and time doing so. If you were taking such care, then any appropriate NAs would already be present in the vectors before you put them into the matrix, and the original question would not have crossed OPs mind because the vectors world already be of the same length. NA means that information for a specific position is "unknown", not "space filler".

Now if OP wants better guidance on restructuring their analysis, then certainly sharing those details would help the discussion move away from the original misguided question... but that would be another thread to answer the question that should have been asked.

Subject: [R] Default t test in R is Welch's test, not Student's,
 and can be very problematic
Message-ID: <AM7PR01MB662659E29C5A31B6C81D415FDC232@AM7PR01MB6626.eurprd01.prod.exchangelabs.com>

Hi all.

I'm just writing to draw your attention to this paper, which is Open Access:

Curtis, D. Welch?s t test is more sensitive to real world violations of distributional assumptions than student?s t test but logistic regression is more robust than either. Stat Papers (2024). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00362-024-01531-7
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00362-024-01531-7?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=oa_20240304&utm_content=10.1007/s00362-024-01531-7

I hadn't really noticed that the default implementation of the t test in R uses Welch's method rather than Student's. I know some people prefer Welch's method but the paper describes how it can be systematically biased and produce extremely low p values in real world scenarios.

If you agree with me, you might want to consider generally using Student's test instead, by using t.test(x, y, var.equal = TRUE).

Code to demonstrate the problem and play around with different scenarios, as described in the paper, is at: https://github.com/davenomiddlenamecurtis/TestTTest

Subject: [R] How to invert axis within defined range with ggplot2
 scale_y_reverse?
Message-ID: <CAMk+s2RKKTAcLYBLN2zDJ+rcEhEWO80TDwo7VrpT-tavd-KetQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I am drawing some data with ggplot2 and would like to reverse the
order of the y axis and set a custom range for it.
I can do the former but when I add the key `limits` to
`scale_y_reverse` I get an error as shows below and, worse, no data
shown in the plot.
How can I properly set a reverse y scale with a defined range in ggplot2?
Thank you

```
A <- rep(c(0, 3, 6, 12, 24), 3)
B <- c(rep(0,5), rep(1,5), rep(2,5))
V <- c(27.5,    27.01,    27.75,    27.98,    27.4,    25.69,
26.17,    27.78,    26.08,
       24.97,    23.18,    21.78,    22.49,    21.85,    22.2)
df <- data.frame(Conc = A, Time = B, Value = V)
df$Conc = as.factor(df$Conc)
df$Time = as.factor(df$Time)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(df, aes(x=Time, y=Value, colour=Conc, group=Conc)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_reverse(limits = c(20,30)) +
  geom_point(size=6) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = COLS)

Thank you. I though the values would have been reversed automatically.
Case closed then

Subject: [R] Function environments serialize to a lot of data until they
 don't
Message-ID: <20240308155759.35b22dbc@Tarkus>

Hello R-help,

I've noticed that my 'parallel' jobs take too much memory to store and
transfer to the cluster workers. I've managed to trace it to the
following:

# `payload` is being written to the cluster worker.
# The function FUN had been created as a closure inside my package:
payload$data$args$FUN
# function (l, ...) 
# withCallingHandlers(fun(l$x, ...), error = .wraperr(l$name))
# <bytecode: 0x5644a9f08a90>
# <environment: 0x5644aa841ad8>

# The function seems to bring a lot of captured data with it.
e <- environment(payload$data$args$FUN)
length(serialize(e, NULL))
# [1] 738202878      
parent.env(e)
# <environment: namespace:mypackage>

# The parent environment has a name, so it all must be right here.
# What is it?

ls(e, all.names = TRUE)
# [1] "fun"
length(serialize(e$fun, NULL))
# [1] 317

# The only object in the environment is small!
# Where is the 700 megabytes of data?

length(serialize(e, NULL))
# [1] 536
length(serialize(payload$data$args$FUN, NULL))
# [1] 1722

And once I've observed `fun`, the environment becomes very small and
now can be serialized in a very compact manner.

I managed to work around it by forcing the promise and explicitly
putting `fun` in a small environment when constructing the closure:

.wrapfun <- function(fun) {
 e <- new.env(parent = loadNamespace('mypackage'))
 e$fun <- fun
 # NOTE: a naive return(function(...)) could serialize to 700
 # megabytes due to `fun` seemingly being a promise (?). Once the
 # promise is resolved, suddenly `fun` is much more compact.
 ret <- function(l, ...) withCallingHandlers(
  fun(l$x, ...),
  error = .wraperr(l$name)
 )
 environment(ret) <- e
 ret
}

Is this analysis correct? Could a simple f <- force(fun) have sufficed?
Where can I read more about this type of problems?

If this really is due to promises, what would be the downsides of
forcing them during serialization?

Creating and setting environments is brittle and easy to get wrong. I
prefer to use a combination of proper lexical scoping, regular
assignments, and force() as I do below.

Just force(fun), without the assignment, should be enough, or even
just fun, as in

    function(fun) { fun; <do something with fun> }

Using force() make the intent clearer.

Closures or formulas capturing large amount of data is something you
have to be careful about with serialization in general and distributed
memory computing in R in particular. There is a little on it in the
parallel vignette. I know I have talked and written about it in
various places but can't remember a specific reference right now.

I usually define a top level function to create any closures I want to
transmit and make sure they only capture what they need. A common
pattern is provided by a simple function for creating a normal
log-likelihood:

     mkLL <- function(x) {
 	m <- mean(x)
 	s <- sd(x)
 	function(y) sum(dnorm(y, m, s, log = TRUE))
     }

This avoids recomputing the mean and sd on every call. It is fine for
use within a single process, and the fact that the original data is
available in the environment might even be useful for debugging:

     ll <- mkLL(rnorm(10))
     environment(ll)$x
     ##  [1] -0.09202453  0.78901912 -0.66744232  1.36061149  1.50768816
     ##  [6] -2.60754997  0.68727212  0.31557476  2.02027688 -1.42361769

But it does prevent the data from being garbage-collected until
the returned result is no longer reachable. A more GC-friendly, and
serialization-friendly definition is

     mkLL <- function(x) {
 	m <- mean(x)
 	s <- sd(x)
 	x <- NULL  ## not needed anymore; remove from the result's enclosing env
 	function(y) sum(dnorm(y, m, s, log = TRUE))
     }

     ll <- mkLL(rnorm(1e7))
     length(serialize(ll, NULL))
     ## [1] 734

If you prefer to calculate the mean and sd yourself you could use

     mkLL1 <- function(m, s) function(x) sum(dnorm(x, m, s, log = TRUE))

Until the result is called for the first time the evaluation of the
arguments will be delayed, i.e. encoded in promises that record the
expression to evaluate and the environment in which to evaluate
it:

     f <- function(n) {
         x <- rnorm(n)
         mkLL1(mean(x), sd(x))
     }
     ll <- f(1e7)
     length(serialize(ll, NULL))
     ## [1] 80002223

Once the arguments are evaluated, the expressions are still needed for
substitute() and such, but the environment is not, so it is dropped,
and if the promise environment can no longer be reached it can be
garbage-collected, It will also no longer appear in a serialization:

     ll(1)
     ## [1] -1.419588
     length(serialize(ll, NULL))
     ## [1] 3537

Having a reference to a large environment is not much of an issue
within a single process, but can be in a distributed memory parallel
computing context.  To avoid this you can force evaluation of the
promises:

     mkLL1 <- function(m, s) {
 	force(m)
 	force(s)
 	function(x) sum(dnorm(x, m, s, log = TRUE))
     }
     ll <- f(1e7)
     length(serialize(ll, NULL))
     ## [1] 2146

The possibility of inadvertently transferring too much data is an
issue in distributed memory computing in general, so there are various
tools that help. A very simple tool available in the snow package for
snow clusters is snow.time(), which can produce some summary times and
a Gantt chart (patterned after ones produced by xpvm and xmpi). For
example, going back to the first definition of mkLL1 you can try

     mkLL1 <- function(m, s) function(x) sum(dnorm(x, m, s, log = TRUE))
     ll <- f(1e7)
     library(snow)
     cl <- makeCluster(2, type = "SOCK")
     tm <- snow.time(clusterCall(cl, ll, 1))
     print(tm)
     plot(tm)
     stopCluster(cl)

snow.time() is not very sophisticated, not very well tested, and may
be a bit brittle. It has not been not ported to the parallel package,
but it looks like most of the plumbing is there so porting it might
not be too hard.

Many. Think NSE, defaults that assume something happens in the body
before the are evaluated ...
